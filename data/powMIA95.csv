"    WORLD NEWS BRIEFS; Kenya Agrees to Expand U.S. Use of Military Bases  WASHINGTON, June 27 (Reuters) - Kenya has agreed to expand American access to its military facilities in exchange for increased military and economic aid, the State Department announced today. Details of the agreement are still to be worked out.  Oman has also agreed to such an arrangement, but Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie indicated this week that there were problems in talks with Somalia.  American officials said the United States wanted to use Kenya's air and port facilities more often and it was logical to expect that depots for fuel and spare parts and possibly even a hangar would be established. United States naval vessels have called at Mombasa for many years.  Dutch Government Survives Censure Vote  THE HAGUE, June 27 (Reuters) -The future of the Dutch Government was in doubt after it narrowly survived a parliamentary censure motion today.  Prime Minister Andreas A.M. van Agt's center-right Cabinet, under fire for its refusal to forbid the sale of oil to South Africa, survived on a vote of 74 to 72 at dawn after an all-night debate.  The embargo would be largely symbolic because South Africa imports little oil from the Netherlands. The Government has said that it favors an embargo but that unilateral action would have little impact. Parliament adjourned today for the summer.  26 Jamaicans Charged In Alleged Coup Plot  KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 27 (UPI) - Twenty-six soldiers were charged today in an alleged plot to overthrow the Government of Prime Minister Michael N. Manley. Seven others still face charges.  As officials investigated the alleged plot, the police reported that four people were shot and killed overnight in separate incidents in Kingston. The police linked some of the shootings to political gang warfare in Kingston's slums.  Bodies of 400 Americans Reported in Hanoi in 1977  WASHINGTON, June 27 (AP) - A former North Vietnamese undertaker, contradicting the Vietnamese Government, said today that he saw the bodies of 400 American servicemen stored at a former prisoner-of-war camp in Hanoi as late as 1977.  Wearing a helmet and a black visor to prevent his identification because of reported threats to his life, the undertaker told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that as late as mid-1977 he worked on American remains at 17 Ly Nam De Street in Hanoi, which once housed American prisoners, who called it the Citadel or the Plantation. He said that from 1969 to 1975 he and his subordinates processed many of the 400 American remains there. He said the remains were stored in wooden boxes with their personal effects and identification.  He said he had worked for the Vietnamese Government since 1958 but was expelled last year because he is an ethnic Chinese.  Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said that the information had been corroborated but that Vietnam had refused to acknowledge that any more unidentified American servicemen, dead or alive, were in Vietnam.

"   , Thailand, Oct. 6   Two United States officials who visited Hanoi for talks on missing servicemen learned something about Vietnamese tracing procedures but otherwise made little progress, sources close to the talks said here today.  Lieut. Col. Paul Mather and James Tulley, who are based here with the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, held working-level talks with Vietnamese officials from last Wednesday to Saturday on the estimated 2,500 Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  The sources said the Vietnamese officials had refused to agree to hold regular talks on the subject, saying their capability had been reduced by budget and personnel problems resulting from what they called the continuing threat of a Chinese invasion.  But the sources were told that the main difficulty was that the Vietnamese felt that the United States was allied with China, and the officials did not want to cooperate in the tracing efforts.

"    LEJEUNE, N.C., Nov. 21   A former prisoner of war, breaking down as he described how he was tortured with leeches in the jungle, testified today that Pfc. Robert Garwood of the Marine Corps tried to persuade him to ''cross over'' and join the North Vietnamese.  Gustav A. Mehrer, a disabled Army veteran from Colorado Springs, said that Private Garwood told him he had the rank of a lieutenant in the North Vietnamese Army, carried a rifle and had documents urging American soldiers to lay down their arms.  Mr. Mehrer's testimony may have been the most damaging so far in the court-martial of Private Garwood on charges of desertion, collaboration, assaulting two fellow prisoners and trying to entice Americans to surrender.  Private Garwood, 34 years old, who could be sentenced to life imprisonment if convicted, was a 19-year-old jeep driver when he disappeared near Danang in 1969. He reappeared early last year when he handed a Finnish businessman in Hanoi a note in which he asked for repatriation.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",November 22 1980 ,11
"      The United States and Vietnam have reached agreement on a program that will initially permit the immigration of up to 1,500 Vietnamese and their families to the United States, the State Department said today.  The first departures from Vietnam, totaling about 250 people, are expected to begin Thursday aboard a weekly Air France flight from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, to Bangkok, Thailand.  American officials said the Carter Administration, in selecting which Vietnamese were eligible for entry into the United States, was giving priority to those with relatives in the United States or those who were formerly employed by the United States Government.  The State Department spokesman, John H. Trattner, said the program was humanitarian in nature and was unrelated to the question of normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi.

"      Eight years ago at this season the United States carried out the most intensive bombing campaign in history. For 12 days 100 B-52's and 500 smaller planes struck Hanoi and Haiphong. In the Nixon White House the operation was called Linebacker II. To the public it was the Christmas bombing.  Few Americans think about Vietnam now, and fewer want to. But it is necessary to remember, this year especially. For there is reason to doubt that the men about to take power in Washington learned the lessons of the war that came to an end, for Americans, with that last unnecessary paroxysm of violence.  That the Christmas bombing was unnecessary can no longer be doubted. It would never have happened if Henry Kissinger, in negotiating peace terms with Hanoi, had kept the Saigon Government informed and on board. That is clearer than ever from Kissinger's own memoirs.  Just before the 1972 election Kissinger declared that peace was ''at hand.'' But Nugyen Van Thieu and his colleagues in Saigon, surprised by the terms agreed with Hanoi, blocked them and forced the last bloody chapter.  Thieu demanded 69 changes in the agreement, Kissinger says in his memoirs, ''leaving almost no paragraph of the draft document untouched.'' At the next meeting with the Communists Kissinger put the 69 points forward. But the list was ''so preposterous,'' he writes, that ''it must have strengthened Hanoi's already strong determination to dig in its heels.'' Hanoi then demanded changes in its favor.  The American reply was the Christmas bombing. It was Alexander Haig, Kissinger's deputy, who urged the use of B-52's. Then Haig went to Saigon to explain to President Thieu that the United States was ''brutalizing'' North Vietnam.  When the agreement was finally signed in January, how did it differ from the October draft? Kissinger's book says: ''The phrase 'administrative structure' to describe the National Council of National Reconciliation and Concord had been dropped... The Demilitarized Zone was explicitly reaffirmed... A number of invidious references to the United States had been eliminated.'' As Kissinger lists these and other changes, they are almost macabre in their triviality.  The real reason for the bombing is evident. It was intended to punish the party that had agreed, Hanoi, in order to reassure the party that had balked at the terms, Saigon. The bombing - and all the killing in November and December - were the price paid for Kissinger's deception of the Saigon Government during the peace talks.  The bombing was the symbol of a much larger failure: the continuation of the war for four years after every informed person knew it could not be won. The price of that failure was and still is enormous.  From 1969 through 1972 the United States spent $50-billion on the Indochina war, dropped 4 million tons of bombs, lost 20,492 American lives. But the highest cost was not measurable in figures. It was the further polarization of this country, the political embitterment.  How much might have been saved if Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger had really come to Washington in January 1969 determined to liquidate the war. But Nixon, raising his fears about himself to the level of national policy, said we had to continue the war and intensify the destruction or else the United States would be seen as ''a pitiful helpless giant.''  The most disturbing thing about the political transition now taking place in Washington is the sense that the helpless giant syndrome may again become a mainspring of American policy. It is not just the symbolic figure of General Haig. Too many people claiming to speak in Ronald Reagan's name seem to feel that the United States must flex its muscles to prove that it is not weak. There have been other frustrations for Americans since Vietnam, and it is a time of dangerous temptation to the misuse of power.  We have to remember what happened to us in Vietnam. The United States pursued ''victory'' there - a victory unattainable by means that for us were politically or morally supportable - in a war remote from any real American security interest. By doing so, year after obsessive year, we inflicted terrible wounds not only on the land and people of Vietnam and Cambodia and Laos but on ourselves.  The lesson is that effective American strength depends on restraint and wisdom in its use. Wasting our substance in wars remote from U.  S. interests does not impress the world. Nor does it stiffen the will of the American people to confront situations where our fate may really be engaged.  But that is not all there is to remember about Vietnam. The men in Washington who pursued the war knew it was unpopular, and so they turned increasingly to secret means. In their fearful obsession with secrecy they wire-tapped and conducted break-ins and deceived Congress and faked official military records. Nixon even ruled out any public explanation of those last twelve bloody days of bombing.  The end justified the means.  Now politicians are talking again about the need for secrecy and covert action and the hard-nosed use of power. And so we must remember: Beware obsession. Beware secrecy. Beware concentrated power. Beware men untouched by the moral consequences of their acts.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: OP-ED                      ",December 22 1980 ,11
"    To the Editor:  A Nov. 13 Op-Ed article by Anthony Barnett quoted me as having told a delegation visiting the White House in April 1980 that ''there is no reason to normalize diplomatic relations with Vietnam other than liberal, neurotic guilt.'' On Dec. 2, you published a letter from Jerry Elmer, field secretary of the American Friends Service Committee, elaborating on the discussion of Vietnam and Cambodia at which I presumably made the remark. I was at the time a member of the National Security Council staff.  I have the highest regard for the American Friends Service Committee, which, along with other American voluntary organizations, has done splendid work in helping to alleviate the recent Cambodian famine, and I want to set the record straight.  U.S. policy in 1979-80 toward both Cambodia and Vietnam was predominantly focused on averting the disaster facing the five million or so Khmer people who had survived the Indochina war, the genocidal Pol Pot regime and the 1978 Vietnamese invasion. The U.S.  effort was channeled through the International Committee of the Red Cross and the U.N. Children's Fund. The U.S. Government provided $118 million and American private groups - including the A.F.S.C. - over $50 million.  One of the principal obstacles to the international relief effort was the persistent refusal of the Cambodian authorities installed by the occupying Vietnamese army to allow anything approaching adequate entry of food, or minimal monitoring of its use. In their effort to help break the logjam, President and Mrs. Carter, the N.S.C. staff and the State Department all steadfastly refused to be diverted by political considerations or arguments that the U.S. should take sides.  The question of diplomatic relations had been put on hold following the Vietnamese invasion, but unofficial contacts were always available. The immediate issue was whether hundreds of thousands would live or die. Numerous appeals, through many channels, to Hanoi and its Soviet backers seemed to make clear that they were focusing on the conquest of Cambodia and were indifferent to the fate of the Cambodian people.  Despite U.S. policy and the strong opposition of Vietnam's neighbors to any weakening, I was prepared to argue internally for a policy change if there was any real chance it would break through the local obstacles that thwarted the international humanitarian effort.  However, after scores of consultations, and on the basis of all available information (including Vietnam's own food problem), I concluded there was little or no evidence that that would make any difference.  At the meeting described by Mr. Barnett (who was not present) and Mr. Elmer (who was), a great many things were said. The only remark of mine they chose to quote - assuming that I indeed made that remark - can doubtless be ascribed to fatigue, although I will confess to exasperation: one of the participants had just returned from telling the leadership in Hanoi that the White House and the State Department had ''used the Kampuchean crisis to provide political support for the Pol Pot regime'' and that the funds the U.S.  contributed were only ''ostensibly to be spent for aid to Kampuchea.'' He had also told the Hanoi leaders that Mrs. Carter's visit to refugees in Thailand had been ''part of the President's strategy to override the influence of the N.S.C.''  Anyone who knew the facts knew that this outrageous tissue of lies and distortations could only have the effect of encouraging the Vietnamese rulers to continue their stonewalling, and it is appalling to think how much additional suffering may have been caused by this caricature of the single-minded U.S. efforts to feed the starving.

"   , Thailand, Aug. 23   A program designed to allow Vietnamese to emigrate to join their families, mainly in the United States, has led to only a trickle of departures and appears to be stymied.  Under the plan, which was laboriously negotiated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with the Vietnamese Government early last year, only 647 Vietnamese have legally left for the United States since October although requests for the emigration of about 60,000 have been made by relatives in the United States. Most of those who left Vietnam flew on a few charter flights organized by the United Nations refugee agency and some left on the weekly Air France flights from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly called Saigon.  No United Nations flight has left Vietnam in almost a year. The protracted negotiations between Washington and Hanoi to allow American consular officials to examine applicants in Ho Chi Minh City are stalled, and the only American assigned to the United Nations High Commissioner to screen applicants left Hanoi this month after an eight-month stay without being allowed to visit Ho Chi Minh City.  Blame Is Put on Hanoi  Although American officials here concede that cumbersome United States immigration procedures have not facilitated the task and that bureaucratic mixups have occurred, they and United Nations aides, speaking privately, blame Hanoi, saying it has used the issue to pursue its larger political goals.  The program was negotiated by the United Nations shortly before the outflow last summer of the so-called boat people, mainly ethnic Chinese forced to leave by the Vietnamese authorities. When international pressure, culminating in the Geneva conference of July 1979, caused Vietnam to promise to halt the flow, it tried to get rid of the Chinese by grafting them onto the orderly departure program.  Hanoi subsequently proposed 30,000 names for family reunification under the United Nations program, almost all ethnic Chinese from Cholon, the former South Vietnamese capital's Chinese quarter.  Checked by computer against the names submitted by relatives in the United States, only 74 of the 30,000 appeared to have any ties to Vietnamese in the United States. A recheck turned up 70 more who might have a claim for admission.  Drive for Diplomatic Ties  The lists of names Hanoi submitted appeared to be the result of a block-by-block registration of inhabitants of Cholon, an American official with long experience in Vietnam said. An informant recently returned from Ho Chi Minh City reported that it was common knowledge that many of the people on the lists were ethnic Chinese who had paid the Vietnamese authorities to be expelled but were prevented from leaving after the Geneva conference.  Vietnam is also accused of using the family-reunification program to press the United States for diplomatic relations. After apparently agreeing to accept temporary visits by American consuls assigned to the embassy in Bangkok to screen applicants in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi declared that such consuls could visit only when there was an American embassy in Vietnam.  The compromise of having American officials work in Ho Chi Minh City as members of the United Nations refugee body led to the assignment of the American who was prevented from performing his task. No replacement has been named.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 24 1980 ,11

"    To the Editor:  There is a bold, significant international move that the new Reagan Administration should take which will be practical and constructive: normalize relations with Hanoi. By persisting in its refusal to do this, the United States perpetuates world tensions and problems. Further, we are acting against our own national selfinterest.v.hat could normalization mean?  Economically, American business would get a chance to trade profitably in Vietnam, just as our allies do.  On the humanitarian level, a normalized American presence in Vietnam could help lead to improved conditions for people in Indochina. They need food and technology. We have both. They don't, in part because we destroyed much of what they had.  Morally, we have an unfulfilled obligation to the people of Indochina. The United States, the country most conspicuously present in Vietnam's destruction, is the nation most conspicuously absent during reconstruction. By refusing to normalize relations, we continue the legal banning of trade, aid, development and exchange programs. We thus make the rebuilding process even harder. Certainly we should help those who flee Indochina. But we should also try to restore the shattered society they are fleeing.  The arguments presented by Daniel C. Arnold and R. Sean Randolph (''Don't Recognize Hanoi,'' Op-Ed Dec.23) are similar to the negative rhetoric voiced by the old China lobby before Richard Nixon chose to alter our policy toward Peking. Messrs. Arnold and Randolph contend that our continuing not to recognize Hanoi contributes to ''geopolitical balance'' and serves our interest in a ''stable, secure Southeast Asia.'' The opposite seems more accurate: our policy contributes to instability and imbalance.  Politically, normalization could diminish Vietnam's great dependence on the Soviet Union, thus readjusting the balance of power more in our favor in Southeast Asia. It could also help prevent further conflict between China and Vietnam. The Chinese are less likely to reinvade Vietnam if their American friends are on good terms with Hanoi. The Chinese need what America now provides, in terms of trade and geopolitics, and are unlikely to give up these advantages if the U.S. chooses to recognize Hanoi.  Not all of Indochina's misery today is Hanoi's fault. In recent years our policy has been to ''squeeze'' Vietnam, to isolate it, perhaps even to help make conditions worse there than that tragic nation would otherwise have endured. It seems clear that Vietnam dominates Laos and Kampuchea now, as it has over the centuries. But to use that as an argument against normalization in 1981, or as a reason to back the genocidal Pol Pot, only fosters continued unrest. Normalization would help signal to China that we will no longer bolster its murderous ally.  The Indochina war was, is and will be a bitter experience for many Americans. Someday we will have to come to terms with what we did there. Candidate Reagan declared our role in that war ''a noble cause.'' President Reagan should consider an even more noble cause - peace. The war is over. Let the peace begin. And that means normalization of relations with Hanoi.

"    To the Editor:  Gareth Porter's advocacy of accommodation with the Vietnamese (Op-Ed Nov. 11) fundamentally conflicts with the realities of Indochina. North Vietnamese imperialism, first directed at South Vietnam and Laos and then at Cambodia, remains the basic problem in Indochina, and such imperialism only understands the language of force.  he Hanoi regime, which has driven hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese people to their death on the high seas or in concentration camps, really cared nothing for the plight of the Cambodians under Pol Pot, whom it installed in power. Instead, Hanoi, in tandem with Moscow, has proceeded to set up its own Marxist empire in Indochina, the Soviet's East Asian proconsul. But as with the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan, the people have rebelled against their overlords.  Rather than rescuing the oppressors in either case, the United States should help those resisting the new colonialists. Indochina and Afghanistan are both draining Soviet resources that might otherwise be directed at either new aggression elsewhere or even larger strategic expenditures.  Gareth Porter suggests that we should provide aid to Hanoi if it withdrew its occupation forces from Cambodia. That would simply reward aggression. It would be more appropriate for Hanoi to withdraw its occupation armies not only from Cambodia but also from South Vietnam and Laos. Only then could peace and the possibility of accommodation of all forces in Indochina begin.  JEFFREY B.

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 18   Four American veterans of the Indochina War, trembling with emotion, stepped off a plane at a bleak Hanoi airport late this afternoon to an enthusiastic welcome by Vietnamese officials.  One of the veterans, Tom Bird, a former infantryman with the 1st Cavalry Division, started walking down the steps of the plane before noticing a group of  Vietnamese soldiers waiting to greet him.  Mr. Bird swiftly returned to the plane, trembling.  ''My first instinct was to call the whole thing off,'' Mr. Bird said several minutes later, returning outside. ''It's just too strange. I feel a little out of control.''  Mr. Bird and three other veterans, led by Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, were taken in limousines to the sprawling, Cuban-built Thang Loi (Victory) Hotel on the fringe of Hanoi. They are on a six-day visit to talk to officials here and in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, about the issues of the estimated 2,500 American servicemen still unaccounted for since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, as well as the Agent Orange question and the impact of the defoliant on the local populace.  Seeking Information on Defoliant  Mr. Muller, a 36-year old former marine, said the United States Government was seeking scientific information about the defoliant, and his group wants to persuade the Vietnamese to allow American scientists into ''heavy defoliated areas'' to assess the impact.  Besides Mr. Muller and Mr. Bird, the other veterans who arrived today after picking up visas in Bangkok were Michael Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant who flew bombing missions over North and South Vietnam, and John Terzano, a former Navy seaman. At the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, an official wished the group ''Merry Christmas.''  Three hours later, at the Hanoi airport, Foreign Ministry officials who deal with defoliation as well as the question of G.I.'s missing in action welcomed the group. Tonight, a Government spokesman, who asked to remain unidentified, said: ''It was sensible to invite the veterans to come here. They were victims of the war like many of our people were victims.''  During the flight from Bangkok aboard a packed Soviet-built Ilyushin 138, the veterans were alternately exuberant and reflective.  ''It's strange,'' said Mr. Muller. ''I can't figure out if I know the passengers on the plane, if I have seen them before. If I know them or if they know me.''  'Nothing Has Changed'  Mr. Harbert, who is now a management consultant in New York, stared out the window and recalled the missions he flew over the same lush, green mountains, over the Ho Chi Minh trail and the Cambodian and Laotian border regions.  ''Nothing has changed, but everything has changed,'' he said. ''I close my eyes and I am right back calling in airstrikes over these places. It's so strange. I can still see the scars on the ground.''  ''I feel so good coming back,'' said Mr. Bird, ''but I can't look at these faces up the aisle. I feel frozen.'' From the plane, approaching Hanoi through low clouds, the land was flat green, still pocked with crater holes. At the ramshackle airport, Mr. Harbert said with a shrug: ''It's amazing to fly into Hanoi without people shooting away. People are so quiet, the airport so simple. Like landing in a farm field. In Kansas or somewhere.''  Mr. Muller, who was crippled in the war, was carried down the plane's steps and was promptly surrounded by Vietnamese officials and local photographers. In his car, the Vietnam veteran said quietly: ''I can't even sort out my emotions now. I can't believe it. I am in Hanoi.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 18 1981 ,11
"      After six hours of talks with Hanoi officials, four American veterans of the Vietnam War expressed hope today that the emotional issue of the 2,500 United States servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia could be resolved in the near future.  Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, the leader of the visiting group, urged the Vietnamese to invite the United States to send personnel to assist in the search for the missing Americans. Such a step would ''substantially improve'' Vietnam's relations with the United States and ease the ''logistical burdens'' that the Vietnamese claim to have in hunting for the remains of the servicemen.  Most of the 2,500 servicemen missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are believed dead, although anguished American families believe that some of them remain alive as prisoners of war. Reagan Administration officials believe that the Vietnamese Government has been uncooperative in the search for the missing Americans, although the Hanoi Government insists that there are no American prisoners of war alive in Vietnam, and all remains have been handed over to the American side.  Vo Hoang, director of the Vietnamese office in charge of finding missing Americans, said that the ''logistical problems were enormous'' in terms of sending out helicopters and search parties to jungles to hunt for the remains. Mr. Hoang told Mr. Muller that there was ''considerable hostility'' in villages to search parties looking for Americans.  Interested In American Proposal  ''The village people ask why are we doing this for the Americans,'' Mr. Hoang said. ''Why do we dwell on the past? Why don't we build the future?''  Nonetheless, Mr. Muller, a 36-year-old former Marine, said that the Vietnamese ''viewed with interest'' his group's proposal to send Americans to Vietnam to join the search.  ''This type of move would remove a very clear obstacle to the development of relations between Hanoi and the United States,'' Mr.  Muller said. ''We told them that, and they knew it.''  The Vietnamese, in a meeting with the four Americans who are here unofficially, also promised to allow more Vietnam War veterans to visit the country.  ''I get the distinct sense that the Vietnamese want to have good relations with the United States Government,'' Mr. Muller said.  Other members of the group who are visiting Vietnam for six days are Michael Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant, Tom Bird, an infantryman during the war with the 1st Air Cavalry Division and John Terzano, a former Navy seaman. All are members of the Vietnam Veterans of America.  Several Blunt Exchanges  The group has held several blunt exchanges with Vietnamese officials and has had some internal bickering and conflicts. This morning, for example, the group reluctantly agreed to acquiesce to a Vietnamese request to lay a wreath at the tomb of Ho Chi Minh, but only after asking the Vietnamese to bar photographs.  The veterans themselves, traveling around the city in Russian-made limousines to meet Vietnamese officials, express a range of emotions as they gaze at Vietnamese families pedaling bicycles over the streets.  ''Its so quiet, and the primitive level of everything here is stunning,'' Mr. Muller said. ''When you see this place it's almost obscene to think what we dumped on these people. There's nothing here.''  Mr. Harbert said that the ''standard opening lines of rhetoric at each meeting about United States imperialism'' disturbed him.  ''I don't like it,'' he said. ''I'd like to reply. They've done some pretty nasty things too.'' Mr. Bird, who is currently director of the Veterans Ensemble Theater in New York, said ''a couple of years ago I would have been given a medal for shooting some of the people I'm meeting with.''  ''It blows my mind,'' he went on.  ''What a crazy world this is.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 21 1981 ,11
"   , Vietnam, Dec. 21   Darkness falls quickly in Hanoi now, and by 6 P.M. the steets are silent except for the sound of bicycles wheeling lazily beneath the banyan and pines.  ''Its very drab, very isolating,'' said a young Asian diplomat eating soup in a crowded downtown restaurant. ''Life doesn't change here much. You live in a kind of suspended animation waiting for something to happen, but nothing does. I keep thinking I lost two years of my life in this place.''  Hanoi is a threadbare but still graceful city filled with contrasts. The other night at the Cuban-built Tang Loi Hotel a small group of foreigners, including four visiting American veterans of the Vietnam War, were seated in the gloomy dining room celebrating a birthday with a bottle of French champagne. A large rat darted past the table. The waitress giggled.  The Americans voiced amazement at the simplicity of the city. ''You visit Ho Chi Minh's two-room wooden-frame house, and you see two phones, one to the army and one to the air force, and that's how he carried on the war against us,'' said Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. ''It knocked me out. It was so incredibly basic.''  Vietnamese 'Incredibly Warm'  If the American veterans were nervous about their trip to a country and people they had fought against, the mood was quickly dispelled as soon as they climbed off the plane from Bangkok, Thailand, on Friday. In encounters with passers-by on the street and in dinners and meetings with Vietnamese officials to discuss two main issues - the fate of the 2,500 United States servicemen still listed as missing in action and the impact of the defoilant Agent Orange in Vietnam - the reaction from the Vietnamese has been what one of the veterans, Tom Bird, called ''incredibly warm and sensitive and friendly.''  Visiting a war museum in downtown Hanoi, where photographs and weapons depict the campaign against the Americans, one of the veterans, Michael Harbert, a former Air Force weapons controller who flew 47 missions over North Vietnam, stared at an outdoor exhibit of a Soviet MIG-21 perched atop parts of the wreckage of an American B-52. Mr. Harbert stepped away from his colleagues and suddenly began weeping.  ''I haven't cried in 14 years,'' said the 35-year-old New Yorker.  ''I don't know what happened. It's the face-to-face reality of seeing that MIG, with its 14 stars meaning it shot down 14 planes, and seeing that wreckage. They are proud of it, and I guess they have a right to be, but it just upset me.''  As Mr. Harbert wept, his startled Vietnamese hosts expressed worry and confusion about why the museum visit had stirred him.  Veterans Are Uninhibited  The veterans, without a trace of inhibition, move down such busy streets as Trang Tien behaving like the servicemen they once were, passing out candy and chewing gum to giggling children, nodding to pretty girls and striking up conversations with people in bookshops and gift stores.  Many of the Vietnamese have heard of the Americans' visit over the Voice of America, which seems to be the main source of outside information.  ''You were hurt in the war,'' said an elderly man in sandals, pointing to Mr. Muller's wheelchair as a crowd gathered around the veterans on a street in downtown Hanoi. Mr. Muller replied with a smile: ''I was in the Marines. Shot through the chest by an AK-47.''  The old man shrugged. ''Welcome to our city,'' he said. ''Come back again.''  More Outgoing Than Russians  Vietnamese Government officials accompanying the Americans grin and seem a little startled at the outgoing nature of the Americans, especially as compared with the hundreds of Soviet technicians and their wives who stroll downtown aloof and without a word or a nod to the Vietnamese.  ''The veterans are so cheerful and friendly,'' a Vietnamese official said. ''We know the American people are like that.'' At formal meetings with the veterans, officials inevitably point out that they have ''never have any animosity toward the American people.'' American Governments, on the other hand, have ''lied and sought the destruction of our country,'' the Vietnamese say.  Asian and Western diplomats in Hanoi agree that many Vietnamese miss the personal contact with Americans that they once had. A Western diplomat observed: ''The Vietnamese had 1,000 years of domination under the Chinese, 100 under the French and 8 under the Americans. You fellows are egalitarians. You treated Vietnamese with a level of equality that other foreigners never did. There is, in retrospect, a residue of good will toward the G.I.'s that's very, very strong.''

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 22   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told visiting Americans on Monday that Vietnam would welcome specialists who wanted to study the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange used during the war.  At the conclusion of a 90-minute meeting with four American veterans of the Vietnam War, Mr. Thach embraced each one of them and said: ''We are all victims; we are not enemies.''  In his remarks, he charged that the Reagan Administration remained hostile toward Vietnam and he denied that the Vietnamese were withholding information about the fate of 2,500 Americans missing in action.  He said Hanoi would henceforth deal on the issue with the Vietnam veterans' group and not with Washington.  ''The Vietnamese Government will cooperate with you on the missing in action on a humanitarian basis without any conditions,'' he said.  ''We will cooperate with you, not with Reagan and the Administration. They have repaid our humanitarian activity with hostility.''  One of the Americans, Robert O. Muller, who is executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said later that he ''welcomed this new initiative.'' He said his group would deal with Vietnam's mission to the United Nations.  Mr. Thach, who spoke in English, welcomed the visitors by saying: ''The way for friendship is very long. The way for war is very short. The American people must come to know the Vietnamese people.  We must cooperate with one another. Tell your people that, between Vietnam and the American people, there was no victory or defeat. We were all victims. It was a war of Johnson and Nixon against the American people.''  Mr. Muller, a former Marine officer crippled in the war, said the ''priority issues'' were the question of the missing in action as well as the problem of the herbicide, which was sprayed as a defoliant in South Vietnam and may cause cancer and birth defects.  Mr. Thach agreed to Mr. Muller's suggestion that American physicians and scientists come to Vietnam to assess the impact of the herbicide. Mr. Muller said his aim was to use the possible findings in connection with claims by veterans that they and their offspring had been affected.  Mr. Thach said, ''We will cooperate with you,'' but he added that the Vietnamese Government would grant visas only to investigators who were ''independent and not connected with Reagan.'' Mr. Muller assured him that there were people not connected with the Government who would come.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 23 1981 ,11
"    To the Editor:  For many Americans, Christmas week is a time of joy, remembrance and reconciliation. It is also a time inextricably linked to the history of a terrible conflict, now a decade old, which seared the land and people of Vietnam as well as the bodies and minds of combatants on both sides.  It is nine Christmases ago that American warplanes bombed Hanoi.  This Christmas, some American veterans of that conflict have returned to Hanoi to begin a dialogue about M.I.A.'s (those missing in action) and victims of Agent Orange in both countries.  Their return to Vietnam is painful and poignant for them, but it also holds hope and promise for all of us.  We wish to call on the American people - in our churches, synagogues and homes - to pause and pray that a time of healing may finally have come: that this journey back by some of those who fought will lead us to a much greater reconciliation of individuals and nations still suffering from the physical and psychological violence of that era.  For Christians, Christmas is a time of peace which began with the journey to Bethlehem. Perhaps the journey of these veterans to Hanoi can help us all find a new path toward peace.

"    Four American Vietnam veterans walked through the looking glass last week and got a glimpse of what the war had been like on the other side. Whether their visit to Hanoi achieved much toward their main goal - clarifying the fate of 2,500 Americans still listed as missing in action - was questionable.  But they said it did help them come to terms with their lingering feelings of anger, guilt and fear.  ""The war finally stopped in my mind,"" said former infantryman Tom Bird.  The sight of a Soviet MIG-21 perched atop the wreckage of an American B-52 in Hanoi war museum brought it all back for former Air Force Sgt. Michael Harbert, much as the mothballed World War II bomber did for Dana Andrews in Frank Capra's film, ""The Best Years of Our Lives.""  Mr. Harbert burst into tears.  ""I haven't cried in 14 years,"" he said. ""It's the face-to-face reality of seeing that MIG, with its 14 stars meaning it shot down 14 planes . . . They are proud of it, but I guess they have a right to be, but it just upset me.""  The veterans also met with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach.  He asked them to serve as a liaison with Hanoi, with which Washington has no diplomatic relations, to help resolve the issue of the missing-inaction.  Some anguished American families believe that some of the missing are still being held as prisoners.  Hanoi denies this and also says that it has turned over all remains of American servicemen that it has found.  The Vietnamese Foreign Minister also said Vietnam would admit American doctors and scientists not connected with the Reagan Government to assess the effects of Agent Orange, a defoliant blamed by veterans for severe health problems.  The Americans, members of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said they were aware that their visit might be used for propaganda in Vietnam and attract bad publicity at home.  The Vietnamese remarked on the friendliness of the Americans, who strolled the streets passing out candy and chewing gum to children, for all the world like they were still G.I.'s.

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 22   Vietnam, facing economic crisis, food shortages and an uneasy relationship with the Soviet Union, is seeking to open contacts with the United States that would lead to diplomatic ties.  Comments by Western diplomats in Hanoi, as well as statements by Foreign Ministry officials, indicate that the Government's welcome to four visiting American veterans of the Indochina war represents an initial effort to stir public opinion in the United States.  Hanoi's aim, according to diplomats here, seems to be ''starting a process'' that would alter the Reagan Administration's stern resistance to normal relations with Vietnam because of the nation's occupation of Cambodia.  Visits by Scientists Planned  ''Tell your people we are friends, we are not enemies,'' Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told the veterans in agreeing to accept American doctors and scientists to assess the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange and to work with the Vietnam Veterans of America on the question of Americans missing in action.  Life is bleak in Vietnam today, a situation brought about by political isolation, malnutrition in the countryside and urban centers, inflation believed to run as high as 200 percent a year, a series of devastating typhoons that damaged crops, a textbook Marxist five-year plan that began in 1976 and ended in failure, and the damage wrought by the war. The exodus of ethnic Chinese tradesmen and skilled workers has further aggravated the problems.  Beyond this, as a major legacy of the war there remain numerous reeducation camps, where former South Vietnamese officials, military men, intellectuals, lawyers, doctors and businessmen have been placed to be ''rehabilitated.'' Estimates of the number of people confined range anywhere from 20,000 to 200,000; even an approximate figure cannot be determined.  Travel Is Restricted  ''The human rights situation in Vietnam is very grave,'' said one Western diplomat in Hanoi. He said that the Vietnamese now needed travel permits to take a trip outside their own provinces, that job allocations have split up families, and that freedom of association was banned.  Even in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, which retains some of the frenetic tempo of the old ''pre-liberation'' days, authorities have closed down the city's renowned book market and confiscated ''unconstructive'' works, including children's fairy tales, romantic novels, mysteries and histories of the French and American involvement, the diplomat said.  At the moment, food is the major problem. Although Nguyen Lam, chairman of Vietnam's State Planning Commission, said the nation would meet its goals this year and produce a record 15 million tons, 600,000 tons more than last year, the effect of two typhoons in recent years coupled with the north's unsuccessful attempt to impose farm cooperatives and collectivization on the peasants in the south has left the population stricken and hungry.  ''My students sit and stare and clutch their stomachs with hunger,'' said Nina McCoy, an American who works for a Swedish aid group teaching English to Vietnamese medical students at a hospital in Vong Bi, l00 miles northeast of Hanoi, as well as in the capital.  ''People are lucky if they have rice and maybe a boiled vegetable twice a day. There's no fish, no high protein, and the malnutrition among children scares me.''  'I'm Seeing People Shrink'  Miss McCoy, who is from Cottage Grove, Ore., and is a 1967 University of Oregon graduate, has worked in Vietnam since July 1979, without any difficulty from the Hanoi authorities. ''I'm seeing people shrink before my eyes,'' she said. ''It's unbearable. Whatever food people have they try to give to their kids.''  Food rations in many parts of the country, especially the north, have been cut from an average of 31 pounds a month to 25.5 pounds, far below the 33 pounds considered the minimum subsistence level necessary before the onset of serious malnutrition. Fish, which used to be plentiful, is now in short supply, partly because fuel is scarce and many boats have sailed away with refugees.  On the free market, chicken costs about $2.04 a pound, other meat about $1.30 a pound, and rice about 45 cents a pound. The average income in Vietnam is put at only $160 a year, and one Asian diplomat in Hanoi said that the nation's economy reminded him of ''Bangladesh on a good day.''  Mistakes in Planning Admitted  Vietnamese officials publicly concede that ''mistakes in economic planning'' - or rigid adherance to collectivization and nationalization of farms - has jolted food production. One of the reasons for increased food output in recent months is a relaxation of controls that opens the way for some incentives and private enterprise.  It is this delicate balancing between ideology and reality that has made it clear to diplomats in Hanoi that the Government seeks relations with the United States. It seemed clear to the American veterans, who met Vietnamese officials - as well as foreign diplomats - that the Hanoi Government's view of the United States was skewed by the antiwar movement during the 1960's. The Vietnamese Government presumably feels that by meeting private groups of American citizens now, such as the veterans, it can build up pressures on the American Government.  The American group was led by Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America. His companions were Michael R.  Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant; Thomas A. Bird, a former infantryman, and John F. Terzano, who was a Navy seaman. All are members of the Vietnam Veterans of America.  Ties Seemed Near in '78  What Vietnamese Government officials seem not to realize, judging from a journalist's conversations with some of them, is that Hanoi hardly has the kind of popular support in the United States that the Government here assumes it has, and that normal relations with Vietnam are not a priority among Americans.  According to several accounts, normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam appeared near at hand in the fall of 1978 and discussions began on establishment of embassies. In Hanoi, the Vietnamese now show American visitors the elegant villa on Hai Ba Trung Street that was to have been the United States Embassy. But the Carter Administration drew back at the last moment because of the impending normalization of relations with China, which was antagonistic to Vietnam.  What followed, in November 1978, was a Vietnamese-Soviet treaty of cooperation that makes the Hanoi Government firmly reliant on Moscow.  Estimates of Soviet aid run from $3 million a day to $6 million a day for military and civilian projects, including most of the upkeep of the 200,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. There are thought to be 8,000 Russians in Vietnam now, and the Soviet Air Force and Navy have acquired repair and refuelling facilities in Da Nang and Cam Ranh Bay.  'Guest Workers' Sent Abroad  To repay the huge military and economic assistance, Vietnam has sent approximately 50,000 ''guest workers'' to factories in the Soviet-bloc countries, according to Western diplomats. In effect, the workers are paying off Vietnam's debt by receiving only a part of their East European salaries. The rest is set aside for debt servicing.  Vietnam's total external debt has climbed to $3 billion, according to official Vietnamese sources. Of this amount, about $1.6 billion is thought to be owed to Soviet-bloc countries.  Tensions between the Soviet Union and Vietnam have already arisen over Soviet influence in Cambodia, and some diplomats here predict that the intensely nationalistic Vietnamese leaders, who fought the French and the Americans, will never fall under the total sway of the Russians.  There are grumbles in Hanoi about the poor quality of some of the corn and rice that the Soviet Union has sent. Beyond this, there are personal complaints. ''The Russians make it obvious that they want no contact at all with the Vietnamese,'' said one foreign aid worker.  ''The Vietnamese say privately that the Russians are rude, overbearing people. The Vietnamese laugh at them. Everyone listens to the Voice of America, and everyone knows what's going on in Poland, and the Vietnamese are not fooled at all.''  Value of Aid Questioned  Moreover, Asian and Western diplomats in Hanoi say that the Russians are probably already realizing that aid to Vietnam is of questionable value. According to the Far Eastern Economic Review, published in Hong Kong, a team of Soviet shipping experts was shocked recently to find that goods sent from the Soviet Union in 1968 were rotting in the Haiphong Harbor docks. The Vietnamese refused a Soviet request that they clean up the goods.  Sweden, the major Western donor of aid, is finding ''severe difficulties,'' according to one Asian diplomat in Hanoi. Sweden has spent nearly $400 million on a paper mill outside Hanoi that was called ''a classic disaster'' by the diplomat. ''They are building a high-cost, high-technology paper mill,'' he said, ''and the problems of electricity and water and labor are incredible.''  The problems for this nation of 54 million, which has failed to grow enough or earn enough to feed itself, are compounded by the fact that about half the national wealth is used to support the armed forces. With more than 2.6 million under arms, Vietnam has the third largest military force in the world after the Soviet Union and China.

"    The Vietnam War is over, but hostilities continue. The intemperate words ''fraud'' and ''total disgrace'' are being unjustly flung at four Americans for becoming the first Vietnam veterans to journey to Hanoi. The accusers do not speak for the United States; they are an embittered remnant who should not be allowed to add sense and humanity to the war's casualty list.  The Reagan Administration endorsed this trip, for America has an interest in finally resolving the fate of 2,500 servicemen missing in action. That cannot be done without Vietnam's cooperation. Since Hanoi has resisted official inquiries, the Administration plainly sees nothing disgraceful in trying another route. The State Department counseled the four Americans, all members of the middleof-the-road Vietnam Veterans of America.  Vietnam may be telling the truth in insisting that it is withholding nothing on M.I.A.'s. But it will take persistent and urgent inquiries before survivors are persuaded. To cry fraud or to refuse any contact with Vietnam won't bring back the missing. Neither will it help determine how lasting is the damage caused in Vietnam by Agent Orange, another matter of passionate concern to the war's veterans.  Plainly, Hanoi had a wider purpose in inviting the American veterans. Economically hard pressed, and eager to lessen its dependence on the Soviet Union, it hopes for better diplomatic and trading relations with the United States. But the chief obstacle remains: the Vietnamese Army still occupies Cambodia.  What also remains is the Vietnamese delusion that Americans somehow oppose their own Government's policy and, out of guilt, want to make one-sided amends by normalizing relations. Who better to dispel that delusion than Americans who fought in Vietnam?  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",December 29 1981 ,11
"   , N.Y.   An American flag waves above the front lawn in the breeze. Inside the modest house, the floors are crowded with filing cabinets and cartons bulging with photocopies of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Departments of State and Defense.  One wall bears a huge map of Southeast Asia, with scattered sites circled in red ink. Aging photographs of a dark-eyed and short-haired young man in uniform stare solemnly from tabletops and mantels.  ''Nick was 38 on May 18,'' said Gladys Brooks, her tone conversational and matter-of-fact, but she and her husband, George, have not seen their son in more than 11 years. His bomber was shot down over Laos in January 1970, and aside from one early report - that Lieut. Nicholas Brooks had survived the crash, had been captured and escaped twice -he has not been heard from since.  But Mr. and Mrs. Brooks believe that he may be alive in one of those places ringed with red ink on the map, held with other American soldiers in Communist camps. For 11 years, the Brookses and hundreds of other members of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia have waited and hoped. They have also worked to keep the issue of their lost loved ones from vanishing with other memories of the Vietnam War that many prefer to forget.  'The Deep-Freeze Treatment'  In the early years, the Brookses recall, they were honored at the White House, serenaded with stirring renditions of ''The Impossible Dream'' and lauded by the President and Secretary of State for their patriotism. But when the war ended for the United States in 1973, Mrs. Brooks said bitterly: ''All the doors were closed. It was the deep-freeze treatment. This is such a cover-up it makes Watergate look like child's play.''  ''The Government doesn't have the solution, so they don't want to make it known that there is a problem,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''It is too much trouble to try to get these men out, it's not politically feasible, so they just want to submerge the whole thing and wipe the slate clean.''  Two years ago, the Government changed Lieutenant Brooks's status from ''missing in action'' to ''presumed killed in action,'' although there was no new evidence concerning his fate. Until last week, the Brookses and many of the other families of the missing say, the Government had not cooperated with their attempts to discover what happened to the more than 2,500 American servicemen still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.  But last week, a group of C.I.A.-trained Laotians were sent on a secret mission into Laos to investigate evidence from spy satellite photographs and other sources that Americans might be held in a Laotian prison camp. After photographs taken by the group were examined by Government photo interpreters, Henry Catto, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, announced that ''absolutely no credible evidence of the existence of any M.I.A.'s'' had been found.  Began Inquiry on Own  ''We know it's a lie, but there isn't a damned thing we can do about it,'' said Mr. Brooks, who is 62 and an engineer.  Three years ago, frustrated by the Government's inaction, the Brookses began their own investigation. They placed advertisements in Vietnamese and Laotian-language publications around the world requesting that refugees with any information about American prisoners contact them.  The letters have flooded in ever since, with more than 1,000 reports of various kinds, including 317 purported eyewitness sightings of American prisoners. Some of the reports are as recent as early this year, and the stories told by the refugees are chilling.  A Laotian wrote that three Americans had been held prisoner in a cave in Laos: ''They were arrested by the Communists and were kept there. One American was captured 12 or 13 years ago.'' Another Laotian told of 50 Americans ''guarded by the Lao Communist military'' and said that ''sixteen persons were serious sick and the others are sick.''  'We're Pragmatic People'  Such reports have spurred the Brookses to persevere. They spend all their free time - nights, weekends ''and I haven't had a vacation in 11 years,'' said Mr. Brooks - analyzing the flow of information, cataloging the reports and poring over the documents they have obtained from the Government.  ''Our interest is in the whole group of men, not just our son,'' said Mr. Brooks, a World War II Navy veteran who was missing in action after his ship was torpedoed in the Mediterranean. ''We're pragmatic people. We know people get killed in wars. But it's the not knowing that hurts. I'm not saying my son is alive. What I'm saying is that I don't know that he's dead. We have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Americans are still being held over there. But it just seems like nobody gives a damn.''

"   , Vietnam, May 29   Vietnam announced today that it had found the remains of three United States airmen missing since the Vietnam War.  Vu Hoang, director of the Vietnamese office in charge of finding missing American servicemen, said the remains of the three airmen would be turned over to American officials as soon as forensic specialists had completed identification. ''The Vietnamese Government, prompted by good will and a humanitarian spirit, shall continue the search process,'' he said.  The announcement was made during a visit by a three-member delegation from the United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center, based in Hawaii.  ''We're pretty happy,'' said Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of the center, adding that arrangements for the transfer of the remains would be worked out with the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand.  2,500 Listed as Missing  Both sides refused to reveal the names of the three airman, among some 2,500 American servicemen still listed as missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The Vietnamese announcement came less than a month after news reports disclosed that the United States had sent a secret reconnaissance team into Laos to seek evidence of American prisoners of war in jungle camps there. The team returned with no evidence that any Americans were still being held prisoner.  ''I have said many times and I reiterate, there are no American P.O.W.'s alive in Vietnam, and all remains discovered have been handed over to the American side,'' Mr. Hoang said. ''We have no interest to keep them.''  In October a visiting American group was told that the Vietnamese had scaled down their search for Americans missing in action. At that time Hanoi also turned down a United States request for regular meetings between the Casualty Resolution Center and its Vietnamese counterpart.  ----  Action Called Insulting  WASHINGTON, May 29 (UPI) - Ann Griffiths, executive director of National League of Families of Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, said today that if the Vietnamese intended to return the remains of only three Americans, ''it's a deliberate slap in the face.''  ''They are aware our Government possesses a substantial amount of information that has been substantiated by the Defense Intelligence Agency that Vietnam is withholding the remains of over 400 American servicemen,'' she said. ''This is another one of their dribbling out the remains of a couple of people because they must think it suits their purposes. It's really insulting.  ''It, of course, will ease the uncertainty for three of the families,'' she said. ''Of course, we are happy for the three families, if indeed the Vietnamese follow through and return them.

"    Amnesty International issued a report yesterday on a 1979 mission to Vietnam and a subsequent exchange of memorandums in which it urged Hanoi to close ''long-term re-education camps'' for thousands of prisoners still detained without formal charges or trials.  In one of the memorandums, dated September 1980, the Vietnamese said that about one million people had attended short-term reeducation courses ''and enjoyed freedom'' after the fall of the old South Vietnamese Government in April 1975. ''Only 40,000 persons'' were detained for long-term rehabilitation, and 20,000 of them have since been released, the Hanoi authorities reported.  Amnesty International called for an end to detention without trial and an independent commission to examine the reasons for it and to free those against whom no criminal charges could be made. The amnesty group sent a delegation to Vietnam in December 1979, and its members visited three camps and one prison.  A spokesman for Amnesty International, Larry Cox, said that while many prisoners had been in responsible positions under the old regime, ''many appear to be held because of current security considerations'' under the new. Mr. Cox said his group considered Hanoi's responses ''very good.''  The Vietnamese mission to the United Nations yesterday referred inquiries about the report to its counselor, Cu Dinh Ba, but said that he was ''not available'' and could not be reached.

"      The five non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia ended a conference tonight at which they laid the groundwork for their approach to next month's meeting at the United Nations on Vietnam's continuing occupation of Cambodia.  The Foreign Ministers of the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia declared that a political settlement must be based on three initial steps: the introduction of a United Nations peacekeeping force, the withdrawal of the Vietnamese Army and the disarming of the warring Cambodian factions once the Vietnamese have left.  A senior diplomat from one of the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said that the five countries' strategy was to convince Vietnam that it was in its interest to reach a political settlement that would make Cambodia neutral and thus satisfy Hanoi's security concerns.  ''This is not directed against the interests of Vietnam but the beginning of a common effort to enhance the longer-term interests of the region,'' said Carlos P. Romulo, Foreign Minister of the Philippines. ''Asean urges Vietnam to see the light of reason,'' he said, referring to the regional organization by its initials.  Soviet Bloc Opposes Parley  Vietnam, as well as the Soviet Union and its allies, have rejected the call for the conference, which was issued by Secretary General Kurt Waldheim acting under General Assembly resolutions calling for a Vietnamese pullout. Vietnam and the Soviet bloc maintain that the Cambodian situation is ''irreversible.''  Despite the Foreign Ministers' effort to appeal to Hanoi's sense of reason, sterner voices were also heard today and found a favorable echo among some of the Southeast Asian officials and diplomats of friendly powers here to consult with the Asians for the next two days.  A comment made in Peking on Tuesday by John H. Holdridge, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, was a subject of discussion. Speaking at the American Club in the Chinese capital, Mr. Holdridge declared: ''We will seek, if we can, to find ways to increase the political, economic and, yes, military pressures on Vietnam, working with others and in ways which will bring about, we hope, some change in Hanoi's attitude toward the situation.''

Haig Jr.  explained in a briefing for correspondents that Mr. Holdridge made his comments in the belief that he was speaking off the record and was, in any event, not announcing any American military involvement.  The policy, they said, is to seek a political solution to the Cambodian problem and in the process to favor any action undertaken by others that would persuade Vietnam to withdraw its forces.  Haig Calls for 'Collective Strength'  Strong language was also heard from Mr. Haig, who visited the war graves at the Manila American Cemetery today and in brief remarks called for ''sacrifice with vigilance and unity to insure that we maintain collective strength to prevent the forces of evil who would resort again to conflict from having their way.''  Later Mr. Haig visited President Ferdinand E. Marcos at Malacanan Palace and delivered a letter from President Reagan congratulating Mr. Marcos on his re-election Tuesday to a six-year term. The Secretary also congratulated Mr. Marcos in a luncheon toast.  The American endorsement, as well as the announcement that Vice President Bush would represent Mr. Reagan at Mr. Marcos's inauguration June 30, disappointed Filipinos who had hoped that the United States would be more perfunctory in its acknowledgement of the election result.  ----  Vietnam Assails U.S.  BANGKOK, Thailand, June 18 (UPI) -Vietnam condemned the United States today for indicating that it would support military efforts to force Hanoi to withdraw its troops from Cambodia and charged that Washington was preparing to intervene in the region.  The statement, broadcast by Hanoi radio and monitored in Bangkok, was in response to the statement on Vietnam made by Assistant Secretary of State John H. Holdridge in Peking.  Hanoi radio said, ''Mr. Holdridge's statement means that the United States in collusion with China is preparing for intervention in Cambodia.''

"      Last week, a United States Air Force C-130 transport and a 10-member military honor guard flew to Hanoi to retrieve the remains of three Americans killed during the Vietnam war. The ceremony was more than usually noteworthy because such transfers are about the only official contacts that take place nowadays between Vietnam and the United States.  Vietnam ranks at the head of the Reagan Administration's list of ''pariah'' countries. Not only are there no diplomatic relations, but there are no ''interests sections,'' such as the United States maintains with Iraq. Washington, it seems, has set out with almost a vengeance to isolate Vietnam. Since President Reagan's inauguration, American diplomats have been instructed to persuade other countries to ignore Vietnam's appeals for help. Officials say that Sweden and Finland are the only non-Communist countries providing any assistance, outside of some limited United Nations aid, to Hanoi.  The rationale for this policy was stated by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. in Manila at last month's meeting of the five Southeast Asian non-Communist countries. ''Today, the greatest threats to the interests, prosperity and well-being of the peoples of Southeast Asia are the policies of Vietnam,'' he said. ''The United States will not normalize relations with a Vietnam that occupies Kampuchea,'' Mr. Haig said, referring to the 250,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. ''We will continue to question seriously any economic assistance - whatever the source - so long as Vietnam continues to squander its scarce resources for aggressive purposes.''  The limits of such a punitive policy are apparent and are not disputed by American officials. Vietnam's isolation has pushed it further into Moscow's embrace and complicated efforts to find a negotiated solution to the Cambodian crisis. A United Nations conference on Cambodia beginning in New York tomorrow is being boycotted by Vietnam, the Soviet Union and their friends; many other countries which oppose the Vietnamese-backed Government of Heng Semrin have shown little interest in attending. One Asian diplomat said it would be ''a conference that claps with one hand.''  While criticizing Hanoi's past actions, some of Washington's closest Pacific allies, such as New Zealand and Japan, have been urging the United States to try a more conciliatory approach.  Thailand, worried about its own frontiers and trying to stem the exodus of Cambodian refugees and Vietnamese boat people, has begun its own dialogue with Hanoi which so far has produced no results.  Over the long term, some Southeast Asian countries with big Chinese minorities, such as Indonesia, are more worried about China's intentions than Vietnam's, and are uneasy with Washington's tough stance.  The Reagan Administration answer is that conciliation was tried in the past and failed to moderate Hanoi's behavior. Now, Mr. Haig insists, the United States should stand firm not only with Hanoi but with Moscow and make it clear that, until they agree to a proper international forum for ending the Cambodian crisis, Vietnam cannot expect to be accepted by the rest of the world. Moscow Rejected Afghan Talks  The same goes for the Russians and Afghanistan, Mr. Haig has said.  It is now a cardinal element of Administration policy that if the Soviet Union genuinely wants to talk with the United States about strategic arms, it should first discuss Afghanistan. Instead, the Administration notes, the Russians, while continuing to issue arms control proposals for apparent propaganda purposes, last week rejected a European Common Market proposal for negotiations on an Afghanistan solution.  In tracing the history of Vietnamese-American relations, observers have speculated about what the results might have been had one or the other government taken a different decision at one of the many turns in the road. In 1973, for example, the Nixon Administration briefly hoped that the cease-fire it had negotiated with Hanoi might take hold and allow North and South Vietnam to coexist. Mr. Haig, who helped force the Saigon regime to accept that agreement, looks back on those days with bitterness, because of Hanoi's subsequent violation of the accord when it conquered the South in 1975.  The Carter State Department included senior officials such as Cyrus R. Vance, W. Anthony Lake and Richard Holbrooke who felt the Vietnam war had been a mistake and who wanted to end the enmity of the past.  Certainly, at no time since Hanoi's victory over Saigon was a United States Government more sympathetic toward Vietnam than in 1977. But the Vietnamese, for whatever reasons, at first seemed oblivious to the opportunity. They insisted on American aid as a precondition for formal relations, a demand that Congress immediately rejected.  The talks, conducted largely by Mr. Holbrooke, continued into 1978. The Vietnamese dropped their insistence on aid and discussions began on establishing embassies. But as these preliminary talks were about to conclude in the fall of 1978, Hanoi seemed to make normalization impossible again. It forced thousands of Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese to flee as ''boat people,'' it began to build up troops along the Cambodian border and it signed a friendship treaty with Moscow. Even the Carter Administration, predisposed to good relations, dropped the effort and concentrated on normalizing ties with Peking.  Now Vietnam is reportedly in worsening economic straits and, according to a recent Austrian news account, some Hanoi leaders are rethinking their alliance with the Russians, who are referred to derisively as ''Americans without money.'' But for the moment, Washington seems to have no interest in winning over the Vietnamese.  There has been no dialogue, aside from the talks on returning remains of bodies and on boat people, since the Carter Administration. And until Hanoi agrees to negotiate a withdrawal from Cambodia, the Reagan Administration evidently plans to keep it that way.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 12 1981 ,11
"      Today, more than 14 years after he was listed as missing in action over North Vietnam, Comdr. Ronald W. Dodge of the Navy was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.  His family wept as three volleys fired by an honor guard shattered the quiet above his final resting place. The mournful, distant sound of taps brought back memories of long-ago, happier times.  Commander Dodge's remains, with those of two other pilots missing in Vietnam, were turned over to American authorities two weeks ago by the Vietnamese Government. The burial provided an answer, at last, to the question that had been nagging Janis Dodge and her children since May 1967.  Their ordeal ended, in a sense, at 3:30 this afternoon, as a band played ''America the Beautiful,'' Mrs. Dodge stepped forward and laid a single yellow rose on the silver-gray military coffin wherein rested all that was left of Ronald Dodge.  Ordeal of Families Goes On  But for the families of the 2,456 servicemen still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia - the so-called MIAs -the ordeal goes on. Many of the families are beginning to wonder whether there ever will be a final answer to the question that, for them, will not go away: ''Is he still alive?'' During Commander Dodge's funeral, the chaplain seemed to look to the heavens for an answer, calling on God to ''grant Thy great mercy on all MIAs.''  Officials of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia place primary blame for the long delay on Vietnamese authorities. They call the Vietnamese callous, cruel and unconcerned. But the league also asserts that American officials have not done enough.  ''The U.S. Government really hasn't scratched the surface on this thing,'' George L. Brooks, a league director from Newburgh, N.Y., said as he watched gravediggers lower Commander Dodge's coffin into a grassy hillside behind the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  ''They'e got about 30 people working on it when they should have 300,'' he added. ''But I'll admit that under Reagan they're doing more than they used to.''  Officer Reported Seen Alive  Mr. Brooks is the father of Lieut. Nicholas Brooks, a Navy pilot whose A-6 jet went down over Laos on Jan. 2, 1970. Mr. Brooks speaks of him in the present tense - ''he's 38, now'' - because the family has been told that some Laotians saw the lieutenant alive on the ground.  The official position of the State Department and the Department of Defense is that almost all of the missing men are ''presumed dead'' since combat ended for Americans almost a decade ago.  Government officials assert, further, that all that can be done is being done to persuade the Vietnamese to find and return bodies.  Privately, some Government officials have serious doubts that all of the men are dead. At least one behind-the-lines search mission reportedly has been mounted - it apparently turned up nothing - and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe, recently told Congress he was ''personally'' convinced that some were still alive because of the stream of ''live sighting'' reports from refugees. As a result of those reports, the Defense Department's staff concerned with the missing has been doubled, to about three dozen people.  Military Authorities Working  ''We work at it constantly,'' said Lieut. Col. John Fer, of the Air Force, the Defense Department's principal adviser on missing-inaction affairs.  ''We send a constant stream of information and questions to the Vietnamese,'' he continued, ''but they mainly approach it on a 'Don't call us, we'll call you' basis.''  Thus far, after eight years of intermittent meetings and discussions, the remains of 78 servicemen have been returned. Besides the body of Commander Dodge, a native of Olympia, Wash., who would have been 45 years old last month, the latest turnover included the remains of Capt. Richard H. Van Dyke of the Air Force, a pilot from Salt Lake City, and the remains of Lieut. Stephen O. Musselman of the Air Force, a pilot from Texarkana, Tex.  Defense Department officials said the death certificates accompanying the bodies asserted that the men had died when their planes went down. No other information was provided, not even an explanation as to what happened to Commander Dodge, who was photographed alive after being downed. That picture appeared in many publications in the late 1960's, and both lifted and depressed the Dodge family.  The denial of information ''is the same sort of thing the Vietnamese did with the French after they pulled out of Vietnam,'' Gladys Brooks, Lieutenant Brooks's mother, said this afternoon. ''It just tears at you.''  However, officials of the League of Families report that most relatives of missing men are not suffering serious psychological or economic hardship. ''The military has death benefits and all that and a lot of the children were too young when their daddies went down to remember much,'' said Carol Bates, the league's director of public affairs.  What Was Dad Like?  ''But,'' she added, ''how do you reorder your life if you don't really know whether your husband is dead, or how do you grow up without wondering a lot what your dad was really like? That's what's happening. They're the things that are bothering people.''  The wondering has intensified even more as refugees and other travelers continue to bring out reports. '' League officials say they have been told privately by officials that some of the people providing information have passed lie detector tests on their stories of seeing Americans held in jungle camps.  ''We've even got a good report that they're holding 400 bodies in Hanoi,'' George Brooks said as he left Commander Dodge's gravesite.  The coffin had been lowered into a vault and the sound of another firing squad was echoing off the hillsides.  ''Will I ever see Nick again?'' he asked, musing as a fresh summer rain fell. ''I don't know. I don't know whether he's alive. Worse, I don't know whether he's dead.''

"    To the Editor:  Thomas Powers's review of Wilfred Burchett's ''At the Barricades'' omitted some of the more revealing parts of Mr. Burchett's career, parts of which ought to be known to anyone contemplating spending $15 on the book.  A K.G.B. defector, Yuri Krotkov, has testified that he knew Mr.  Burchett well in Moscow and tried to help him in his attempt to get on the K.G.B. payroll. Here is how Mr. Krotkov's testimony was summed up by the judge in an unsuccessful libel suit that Mr. Burchett brought against a member of Parliament in Australia in 1974.  ''There then was talk about the amount of money that a correspondent would need, and it was said to be about 10,000 rubles per month, and a free apartment and a car; and according to him (Krotkov) Burchett said that was what he wanted, to live and work as a foreign correspondent, that he wanted 10,000 rubles per month, a free apartment and a car. And these sort of things were discussed between him and Burchett in an indirect fashion; and he gave evidence of what Burchett had told him about the way he functioned in Korea, and the way he functioned in Hanoi, where he had worked for the Chinese and North Vietnamese Governments. ...  ''Burchett said to him, 'I am really a member of the Australian Communist Party, but all these years I was involved in sort of illegal activities. In other words, I didn't say openly whether I was a member of the Communist Party or not, but I was and I am. And as a member of the Communist Party I was in China; I was and I am in very close relation personally with Chou En-lai. ... And I served our case, the Communist case, the Communist Party of China, giving them very valuable information when I was in Korea among the foreign correspondents. ... The same thing happened in Hanoi. I went to Hanoi and I am now in Hanoi. I am established there on the payroll of the party. I am in close relation with Ho Chi Minh ... I am deeply involved in this trouble against the Americans ... And of course, I can be as useful in Moscow, again from an ideological point of view, for our common cause.' ''  Mr. Krotkov went on to say that Mr. Burchett maintained a close relationship with Colonel Borodin Barsegov, then head of the special K.G.B. department responsible for subverting foreign correspondents in Moscow. Mr. Krotkov identified Mr. Burchett's ''case officer'' as Victor Kartzev, a top-rank K.G.B. officer.  No discussion of Wilfred Burchett would be complete without mention of the prominent role he played in extracting and rewriting phony germ warfare confessions from American POWs in North Korea during the Korean War. Derek Kinne of Tucson, Ariz., was one of the POWs who says he suffered because of Mr. Burchett. Mr. Kinne says he argued with Mr. Burchett in the POW camp, and Mr. Burchett said, ''I could have you shot.'' Immediately after that Mr. Kinne was subjected to cruel torture because of the way he had talked to ''Comrade Burchett.'' He was kept in solitary confinement for 13 months. ...

"      The Defense Department said today that remains turned over to the United States authorities in Thailand in July and August were not those of eight American servicemen missing in Laos.  A Pentagon announcement said the remains were all ''Southeast Asian Mongoloid and not American.''

''Analysis by the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii proved this contention to be false,'' it said.  The announcement also said the United States Government was continuing to press the authorities in Indochina for the fullest accounting of missing Americans but had got ''extremely little cooperation.''

They were buried after a ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery.  More than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in action in Indochina.  Found by Guerrillas  According to a report July 14 from Bangkok, an embassy spokesman, Lieut. Col.

The report quoted Colonel Mather as saying the remains had been turned over to him by an American citizen who lives in Bangkok, identified as Robert W. Schwab 3d. The report added that unidentified sources close to anti-Communist Laotian guerrillas said he recently accompanied a group into southern Laos to a crash site where the remains were found.  On Aug. 13, according to a report from Bangkok, the embassy received what were said to be the remains of four more American airmen shot down over Laos. The report added that George Brooks, a member of the board of the National League of Families, an organization set up in 1970 to find Americans missing in action, said he acted as an intermediary in handing over the remains.

"    To the Editor:  With regard to your Dec. 30 editorial ''Apocalypse Forever?'' pertaining to the four Vietnam-era veterans who recently visited Hanoi, I am amazed at The Times's naive view of both the veterans' and the Communists' motives for the trip.  The Reagan Administration certainly did not endorse this Penthouse magazine-sponsored trip. It was simply that t here was no way to stop it. Thus the veterans were briefed by both th e State and Defense Departments, to acquire a quick education on the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue and be cautioned against being used for propa ganda by the Vietnamese.Members of Congress familiar with this issue provided similar counsel, as did the National  League of P.O.W./M.I.A. Families.  While the league certainly welcomes help and support from concerned Americans, it is frankly appalling that Robert Muller and his associates have yet to contact our organization to brief us on the results of the trip, particularly since one of their alleged issues was accounting for the 2,500 missing Americans.  The Times is erroneous in attributing credibility to Hanoi's claims that it possesses no information on the missing. There is convincing evidence that live Americans are still being held in Vietnam, and there is valid intelligence data to prove that the Vietnamese are currently warehousing the remains of over 400 Ameri-cans. The group was briefed on this evidence by the Defense Intelligence Agency, rendering Mr. Muller's parroting of Communist denials even more astounding.  P.O.W./M.I.A. families have no desire to prolong the war; we simply want to know what happened to our men. Hanoi has answers and our Government will eventually have to deal directly with them to resolve the issue. Giving Mr. Muller the benefit of presuming his stated motives to be valid, the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue is a serious problem and there is little room for amateur diplomats.

"    Drew Middleton states, ''The commanders on the scene may have been right in thinking that the Chinese would not intervene'' against ''an American invasion of North Vietnam''in late 1966. Although what would have happened ''if'' can never be proved one way or another, the facts argue against such conjecture.  Beginning in September 1966, Peking deployed up to 50,000 troops to North Vietnam. Between then and their withdrawal, in mid-1968, after the United States bombing was drastically reduced, two and later three antiaircraft divisions rotated deployment every six months to protect main communications lines, bridges and other targets.  Peking wanted its military presence to be known both to the Vietnamese and the Americans as a token of commitment to Hanoi's defense should Washington invade the North. For nearly three years, American pilots and Chinese forces fought a secret war, with casualties on both sides. Last year, Peking revealed that ''thousands'' of People's Liberation Army (P.L.A.) troops were killed with ''more than 1,000 still buried in Vietnam.''  It is inconceivable that, having signaled its commitment, the P.L.A. would then have turned tail and run back across the border if faced with an American invasion of Haiphong and Hanoi. Abandoning North Vietnam to ''United States imperialism'' would have destroyed Peking's claim to great-power status, both as a socialist ally and as successor to the Middle Kingdom.  ALLEN S.

The official Vietnam News Agency, which announced the changes, said that four newcomers to the Politburo included the commander of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia and a specialist in party organization. The announcement came on the final day of the fifth Vietnamese Communist Party congress in Hanoi.  A diplomat here who closely follows Vietnamese affairs said he thought that General Giap and former Foreign Minister Nguyen Duy Trinh, who also was dropped from the Politburo, had actually retired.  Yielded Defense Post in '80  General Giap, now 71 years old, was generally believed to have been the chief strategist in the Vietnamese victory over the French colonial forces at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, and then in the conflict with the United States. He is believed to have been ailing during the last years of the Indochina war. Two years ago he was replaced as Defense Minister by Gen. Van Tien Dung, who has now risen to sixth place in the Politburo.  Retaining their rankings in the 13-member body were Le Duan, the party chief, President Truong Chinh, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, Gen. Pham Hung, the commander in southern Vietnam, and Le Duc Tho, the chief ideologist.  During the congress, Mr. Duan attributed Vietnam's acute economic problems to mistakes of party and state agencies at all levels. He indicated that more purges and economic changes were ahead and voiced complete support for the foreign policy objectives of the Soviet Union.  Former Economic Chief Dropped  Ousted from eighth position and from the Central Committee was the former economic planning chief, Le Thang Nghi. He was replaced by Nguyen Lam as chairman of the planning commission in 1980, at the same time as it was announced that Vietnam's 1976-80 five-year plan had failed.  Tran Quoc Hoan, a former Interior Minister, was dropped from the No. 10 position.  A new appointment was Lieut. Gen. Le Duc Anh, who holds the 12th spot in the new lineup. He is commander of Vietnam's 200,000-man force in Cambodia and, according to the diplomatic analyst, reinforces the hard-liners in the Politburo headed by Le Duc Tho.  Another newcomer is Nguyen Duc Tam, who is believed to be the chairman of the organizational department of the Central Committee.

"   , Thailand, April 24   Vietnam has shuffled its Cabinet to change the country's economic leadership, the Vietnam press agency said today.  The shuffle, which affected 14 of the 42 portfolios, came after last month's Fifth Communist Party Congress in Hanoi, which stressed the need for economic change.  Almost all the 14 posts are related to the economy, which in recent years has been hurt by food deficits, low foreign exchange reserves, flagging industrial production and a large diversion of resources to support Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.

"   , Vietnam, May 29   Vietnam released information today about four American soldiers who were believed killed in the Vietnam War and said more bodies of dead soldiers would be returned to the United States.  The information was given to a group of six Vietnam veterans and three other Americans who arrived in the capital Friday.  The Hanoi Government also announced that in the future it would deal with the veterans' group, and not with the United States Government, on questions involving 2,500 American servicemen whose fates in the Vietnam War are still unresolved.  Names Listed for 4  A Vietnamese spokesman gave the names of four Americans who had been listed as missing in action in Vietnam and said that the bodies of four or five other Americans had been found.  Only one of the eight or nine reported sets of physical evidence included both a body and an identity card. The body was said to be that of Lieut. (j.g.) Donald Patrick Frye.  The Vietnamese Government said Lieutenant Frye was believed killed on July 19, 1967, in the province now known as Ha Nam Ninh, south of Hanoi. The province is the product of a merger of the former provinces of Ha Nam and Ninh Binh.  Three other American servicemen, whose identification cards but not bodies were turned over to the veterans, were listed as Joe R.  Mossman, Hestle Roosevelt and Knapp Fredrick Woodrow.  No Information Provided  The Vietnamese provided no other information except to say that the three name tags were found in the three provinces of Ngha Tinh, Bac Thai and Binh Tri Thien.  Bac Thai Province is north of Hanoi. Ngha Tinh and Binh Tri Thien Provinces are along a central strip of Vietnam, from north of the city of Vinh to a few miles below the former South Vietnamese city of Hue.  A Vietnamese spokesman said that ''three or four'' other unidentified bodies had been discovered in Ha Nam Ninh Province and that another body believed to be that of an American had been found in Quang Ninh Province, which stretches northeast from Haiphong to the Chinese border.  It was not clear when the bodies would be turned over to the veterans.  Vietnamese Cites Ingratitude  The last bodies of American soldiers to have been turned over by the Vietnamese were three that were returned to the United States last July. Vietnam's chief negotiator with the veterans, Viet Ngo Minh, said today that the ingratitude shown then by Washington had helped persuade Hanoi to deal with the veterans rather than with Washington.  The veterans were invited by the Vietnamese Government on a weeklong visit after a similar trip last December. The announcement about the return of the bodies was made to a small number of Western newspaper and television reporters after a closed three-hour meeting between the veterans and the Vietnamese.  The reporters were granted visas to cover the veterans' trip.  Mr. Minh said the bodies were discovered in the last few months, after a United States Defense Department team left Hanoi last February. The team, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, came to Hanoi to inquire about Americans missing in action. It left with an agreement that the Vietnamese would send experts to Hawaii to study the technical aspects of identification.  Mr. Minh said today that the experts might still go to Hawaii in August.  The American veterans and their lawyer and the theatrical producer Joseph Papp, who joined the trip to promote cultural exchanges between Vietnam and the United States, were later received by Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach.  Mr. Armitage's mission was not received by Mr. Thach.  ----  U.S. Accepts Hanoi's Move  Special to the New York Times  WASHINGTON, May 29 - The Defense Department issued a statement today in reaction to the report that the Hanoi Government planned to deal with the veterans' group on matters concerning the fate of missing American servicemen.  ''We believe the resolution of the M.I.A. accounting issue depends on Government-to-Government cooperation, but the U.S. Government is willing to accept remains from whatever source,'' the statement said.

"    The Vietnamese economy is in a shambles and Communists and Western economists, in varying degrees, cite war and the huge military establishment as primary causes. But even Vietnamese leaders are beginning to concede that part of the blame must be placed upon government mismanagement, rigid policies, lack of popular support, official corruption and general weariness.  Signs of deep trouble are everywhere. City streets are full of people with little to do but walk, sit or ride their bikes. Consumer goods are extraordinarily scarce, even more so in orthodox Hanoi than in Ho Chi Minh City, an incorrigible center of enterprise. The best hotels cannot find light bulbs. Apartments in a six-year-old housing complex lack running water.  Vietnam reported it produced 15 million tons of food grains last year. The performance, largely a result of allowing some private farmers in the south to sell in an expanded free market, was an improvement over previous years, when floods and other calamities necessitated millions of tons of rice and wheat imports. But imports were sharply reduced to pay the suddenly tripled price of Sovietsupplied oil and Vietnamese nutrition suffered - the people are thin. United Nations experts report most get insufficient calories.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has suffered repeated failures in industrial projects. Lack of raw materials, spare parts, competent managers and engineers has caused even Communist aid missions to demand fundamental changes. Non-Communist aid missions voiced similar complaints before World Bank, Japanese and much other aid was frozen after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978.  The most frustrated donor may be Sweden, after a decade of trying to get a computerized $500 million paper mill going at Bai Bang, north of Hanoi. Despite the labors of more than 600 Swedes billeted in an air-conditioned village, the facility is still not fully operational and Sweden is absorbing the costs. Vietnam has extensive forests but pulp is being shipped in from Sweden, Western diplomats said.  Technicians and diplomats from Eastern Europe have lately admitted to similar frustrations. A Hungarian-backed shoe factory reportedly turns out shoes too shoddy for export. East German technicians at a textile project in Da Nang, a European diplomat said, were arrested after coming to blows with Vietnamese co-workers over how to run things. Nikolai K. Baibakov, chairman of the Soviet state planning committee, is said to have demanded unsuccessfully in Hanoi last fall that Soviet managers be placed in charge of all Soviet projects.  Money and Oil Shortages  Exports last year dropped while prices increased for imported oil, fabric for the textile industry, machinery and most other necessities. Hanoi's foreign currency reserves stood at exactly zero by February of this year, according to a confidential April 29 report by the International Monetary Fund. As of last Dec. 31, it was $38 million behind in payments to non-Communist lenders.  After sharp economic declines in 1979 and 1980, last year was a good one for rice, light industry and some cash crops. But ''such key industries as steel, fertilizer, textiles and cement showed significant declines, mainly because of poor management and continued shortages of raw materials and spare parts,'' the fund said. For lack of payment, Iraq has stopped supplying oil. Aviation fuel is short; flights between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have been cut back. Loans from Libya and Algeria have been rescheduled. A $30 million textile project financed by Italy, Belgium and West Germany is near collapse.  Official statements continue to blame the grim picture on ''30 years of war,'' American bombings, the destruction of agricultural land by defoliants and the death or dislocation of millions of people. They also point to hostile China, requiring Vietnam to keep large numbers of troops (as many as 40 divisions, intelligence sources say) on the Chinese border and in Cambodia. Hanoi also blames its troubles on United States actions in drying up international aid and on domestic ''reactionaries,'' including ethnic Chinese and southerners irreparably corrupted, it says, by the former United States presence.  But Western analysts, increasingly joined by European Communists, stress managerial difficulties. The state-run economy, although less centralized and less fond of heavy industry than before 1979, they say, is still clumsy, slow to make decisions, inflexible on prices, indifferent to export opportunities based on cheap labor, oblivious to quality controls and innocent of the rigors of international trade. Managers are said to be unwilling to take responsibility; workers lack incentives. Western governments, defending their aid cutoff, point to the drain on the economy of the Cambodia occupation. The military absorbs much of the scarce supply of administrators and technicians. (Unlike the Vietnamese, few Western analysts believe that hundreds of thousands of soldiers could easily be transformed into useful workers.)  Criticism by foreign Communists, Western creditors and many angry Vietnamese may be taking effect. The longtime officials and old warriors who run the country may be ready to loosen the economic reins a bit. Vietnamese officials have admitted to Western visitors, moreover, that ''socialist transformation'' of the south - including collectivized farming - will take longer than expected. And Sweden reportedly is being allowed to take control of its monumental paper mill.  Officials have also been telling Westerners that poor countries, socialist or not, lack economic and technical expertise, and that the earlier political purges of experts in the south may have been a mistake. They speak of dreadful bureaucrats, opportunists in the party, the importance of family planning (the population is 55 million and growing at least 2.4 percent a year) and the need to recruit young party members. Occasionally, they even acknowledge what impresses many visitors as widespread weariness behind their good cheer and good manners - cynicism toward the Government and impatience to reap the benefits of peace. ''They are on their kness,'' said a European diplomat in Hanoi. ''I think they will have to make changes soon, to become less rigid.''  His opinion is widely shared among Westerners in Hanoi. But other observers point to the entrenched realities of state planning and poverty, and the declaration at the Fifth Communist Party Congress in March that the socialist transformation of the south must inevitably, albeit more carefully, proceed. Nearly all analysts, Vietnamese and foreign, well-wishers and enemies, agree that the economic crisis is authentic. Most believe that mastering it will require profound reforms. Colin Campbell, a correspondent forbased in Bangkok, Thailand, recently accompanied a group of American veterans on a visit to Vietnam.

"      The State Department accused the Vietnamese Government today of foot-dragging on the expatriation of thousands of inmates at labor detention camps, many of whom are eligible to come to the United States.  A spokesman, Dean Fischer, addressed the issue after Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said over the weekend that all such inmates would be freed if the United States would accept them.  Mr. Fischer suggested the Vietnamese had been less forthcoming in their dealings with United Nations refugee officials who have been serving as intermediaries between Hanoi and Washington.  Many Vietnamese now held in re-education camps probably would be eligible for consideration and many have been accepted for United States resettlement ''but Hanoi has not issued them exit permits,''Mr. Fischer said.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   A pedicab pusher, noticing two curious young men walking alongside his small vehicle, tells his passenger, ''Watch.'' He means the wristwatch: keep it out of sight.  You look around and in many ways the people resemble those in any number of sprawling cities in poor hot countries where there aren't nearly enough jobs, where even the apartment houses built in the 1960's are decaying, where clothes are simple and where, in the crowded market districts, the world seems a sullen hubbub.  But few people wear watches.  The Cuu Long Hotel here still serves cold Pabst Blue Ribbon beer.  At Hanoi's best hotel, the Thang Loi, the beer is mostly warm and nameless.  The Cuu Long is still known widely as the Majestic. And some Government officials still start to say ''Saigon.'' There are no rats in the Cuu Long's fifth-floor dining room, as there are in the dining room of the Thang Loi in Hanoi. And the view from the fifth floor is magnificent up and down the Saigon River.  When a squall comes up, the palms shake, and the rusting ships beside the quay look almost shipshape behind gray sheets of rain.  Even the hotel's telex works much of the time. When it doesn't work, according to a Western communications expert in Hanoi, the reason is often that Ho Chi Minh City's central telex office has stuck stubbornly to the same radio frequency despite a change in atmospheric conditions.  Switching frequencies requires formal approval from Hanoi.  In a public park a poor woman cooks her lunch over a tiny fire. She seems oblivious to anyone watching her.On the steps of a stone statue inscribed ''An Duong Vuong,'' a band of gap-toothed youths and sprawling women in hair curlers, laughing, call out mockingly to a stranger.  ''This is the society you created,'' a Government official comments later, referring to the United States.  Apart from oblivion, however, and come-hither mockery, reactions to an American range from stares, to winks, to lifted eyebrows and a funny greeting like ''hey.''  An amused cowboy on his motorcycle, the bill of his cap pulled squarely over his dark glasses, gave an inexplicable thumbs-up.  But the strangest look comes from a young man sitting on a curb. He is dressed in fatigues and wears the floppy-brimmed green hat once worn by American and South Vietnamese soldiers. His cheeks are hollows, his face expressionless, his eyes black. He looks like a ghost, and may be no less unhappy for his self-consciousness.  Young ladies wear gloves, despite the heat, as they ride their bicycles down the boulevards. Others appear to have camped out semipermanently on the boulevards' roundabouts and medians.  A parked line of American cars, with tailfins, circa 1957, painted red, wait for something along Nguyen Hue Street. Some of the city's public buses are Dodges.  The Coca-Cola signs, by contrast, have been painted over, but you can still buy fresh Kodak film on the black market.  At the low tables in innumerable small coffee houses, opened to the street, people sit for hours, as if rooted to their chairs.  Six months ago, according to one resident, some cafes here offered music at night, but then the musical cafes closed down. Like an estimated 80 percent of southern Vietnam's economic life, they were privately owned. Recently, new versions of the same cafes have opened, and under many of the same managers - but under Government auspices.  By day the shabby cafes are quiet places, and although their customers are known to tell tales in them against the Government, they also sit and watch.  On the street, there is a motorcycle accident, and then a brief traffic jam of trucks and bicycles and pedicabs. A child is arrested by a plainclothes policeman, apparently for shoplifting. The citizens pass by. Women chat with their friends in front of a vegetable stand before buying a few small items. Cigarettes are being offered from countless glass-topped boxes on legs. Cookies for sale from pushcarts.  Madame Dai's restaurant is out of the ordinary. It is tucked into the back room of a once-elegant house along a side street shaded by tall trees during the day and sunk in extraordinary gloom at night.  The Vietnamese are small users of electricity.  But Madame Dai, portly, brilliant and gray-haired, greets her visitors as if they were ambassadors, and her well-lit dining room is so unabashedly ancien regime that even a Communist Party visitor from Hanoi soon softens.  Dusty leather-bound lawbooks line the walls. Most are in French and her copies of ''The Palace Journal of Jurisprudence and Legislation'' date back to at least 1909.  ''I am a lawyer,'' Madame Dai says civilly. She adds, when pressed, ''until 1975,'' when she opened her restaurant.  She would rather not speak English, which she says she speaks badly and which the man from Hanoi speaks well, and instead she rattles on graciously with some European customers.  There are five customers altogether, plus a boy who is studying intently at a table stacked with books, plus many cats. The glasses sparkle.  The man from Hanoi - amid so much worldliness, and after a bowl of soup, a lobster taxied in fresh from the sea, a shish kebab, flan, coffee and several drinks - asks an American what the Americans - ''the people'' - really think about Vietnam.  Not much these days, in his interlocutor's opinion.  ''Are they repressing the war?'' asks the man from Hanoi.  Some, no doubt; but most probably have more immediate things to think about.  Plainly curious beneath his certainties, the man suggests that his country may be somewhat isolated.  One thing that makes a visitor feel that Ho Chi Minh City is somehow occupied territory - even Hanoi admits that ''integration'' has been difficult - is the petitioners. They are everywhere, they want to get out, and there are more of them than the Vietnamese mothers who bring you their photostats of American identification cards.  Male. Thirty-six. A former reporter for South Vietnam's news agency. No longer allowed to work. Married. Two children.  A man who says he is Chinese, with a Nationalist Chinese passport.

"      President Reagan's national security adviser said today that the Administration did not rule out the possibility that some Americans still are being held captive in Southeast Asia nine years after United States troops were pulled out of the Vietnam War.  ''We have no confirmed evidence, but we have enough information not to rule out the possibility that some of our unaccounted-for servicemen could still be held alive in Indochina,'' said William P.  Clark. According to various estimates, nearly 2,500 Americans remain unaccounted for.  ''One of the greatest tragedies of Vietnam,'' he said, ''was that the United States cannot be certain, even to this day, that the treaty we signed to disengage ourselves from the conflict was fully complied with in regard to our prisoners of war and missing in action.''  Mr. Clark, speaking to the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Los Angeles, pledged that the Administration would ''use all means available, including the full intelligence apparatus of the United States, to get to the bottom of this matter.''  'To Take Appropriate Action'  ''Should we find these reports are true, we are prepared to take appropriate action to insure that no American remains a captive,'' he said. ''Simultaneously, we are continuing our efforts to insure the remains of those American prisoners still in Indochina are returned home.''  A copy of Mr. Clark's speech text was released by the White House.  The deputy White House press secretary, Larry Speakes, said Mr.  Clark's statement did not suggest that any new evidence had been uncovered and that his remarks reflected a previously held policy not to write off the possibility that Americans were still being held captive.  ''But we're leaving no stone unturned to try to find out if there are,'' said Mr. Speakes. He noted that there were unconfirmed reports from time to time that the missing have been sighted in Southeast Asia.  Mr. Speakes said Mr. Clark's statement had not been enunciated previously.

More than 1,400 mass graves have been discovered in Kandal, six miles south of Phnom Penh, and initial reports indicate about 16,000 people were killed and buried in 386 of them, the radio said.

"      Ten years ago today, Henry A. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho met in a French Communist Party villa in Gif-sur-Yvette, a Parisian suburb, to initial the ''Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam.'' Four days later, the Secretary of State and the Foreign Ministers of North Vietnam and South Vietnam signed the document at a ceremony in Paris, and on March 27, 1973, the last uniformed American soldier left Vietnamese territory, ending more than a decade of direct American military involvement there.  Today's anniversary is an ironic and tragic occasion because Vietnam is still at war, though this time against other enemies, and because it has become little more than a pawn in the Soviet-Chinese rivalry in Asia. Moreover, Vietnam has become a Soviet client state rather than the fully independent nation it had hoped to be when Ho Chi Minh rose to overthrow French rule in 1945, and an internationally isolated country with abysmally low living standards.  The question arising at this time is why the 55 million Vietnamese find themselves in such an extraordinary external and internal predicament, with millions forceably removed to ''new economic zones'' and other millions officially listed as ''enemies,'' when the Communist regime ruling them was supposedly the victor in what amounted to a 30-year war.  Much of the disaster, as it has unfolded over the last 10 years, may be attributed to Vietnam's wartime exhaustion, its shattered infrastructure - both North and South - and the dogmatic attitudes of the aging ideologues in power in Hanoi.  Still, it remains a valid and fascinating question whether all the events since 1973 were, in effect, foreordained by history, or whether they might have been averted or at least altered, had Vietnamese as well as United States policies moved in wiser directions. I believe a case can be --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tad Szulc is author ''Illusion of Peace,'' a study of United States foreign policy in the Nixon years.  made for the proposition that a diplomatic and economic relationship might have evolved that offered Vietnam alternatives other than the Soviet alliance and internal calamity.  Today, to be sure, Vietnam's significance to the United States lies mainly in its being the site of a major Soviet naval and air base - Cam Ranh Bay - that poses a potential threat to American strategic positions in Asia and the Indian Ocean, but this is still a secondary concern in the Pentagon's global preoccupation.  The ultimate Communist vicotyr in Vietnam in 1975 hasn't produced the ''domino effect'' in Southeast Asia that had been feared: Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, are not seriously imperiled. And Hanoi's entrapment in the endless war of its own making in Cambodia and Laos, pious propaganda notwithstanding, is not wholly unwelcomed in Washington inasmuch as it is deeply damaging to all the Communist players in the region.  In a way that could not be foreseen in Paris in 1973, it is Vietnam that seems, 10 years later, to be the principal victim of that conflict. China has not fared particularly well either, having lost most of its influence in Southeast Asia. And considering America's immense investment - human and material - and the profound societal consequences, it too suffered badly from this unnecessary war; yet its fundamental long-range interests were not catastrophically affected.  If the war produced a winner, politically and strategically, it was clearly the Soviet Union - albeit at a great continuing cost - because the conflict's consequences neutralized China in Southeast Asia and permitted the Soviet Union to acquire military bases both in Vietnam and Cambodia.  But looking back to the peace agreement and its aftermath, it seems evident that the document provided the only way of taking the United States out of a war that was no longer politically tenable at home. While the Nixon Administration had armed the regime in Saigon to the teeth in the months preceding the final American withdrawal (and sought to weaken the North through the Christmas 1972 mass bombings), in retrospect it is clear that a Communist victory was inevitable if Hanoi wanted it. At the moment of the cease-fire, the overall military situation on the ground favored the Communists.  Yet, there may have been lost opportunities on both sides - American and North Vietnamese - for history to develop differently. First, President Nixon promised, in a secret letter to the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, $ 4.75 billion in reconstruction funds, and agreed to a United States-North Vietnamese Joint Economic Commission. An economic accord was to be signed on July 23, 1973. What happened next is unclear. Though the chief American negotiator had reported on March 27, 1973, the day the last American soldier left Vietnam, that the aid pact was virtually ready, he was instructed the following week to break off the talks. The official explanation was that Mr. Nixon had decided to cancel the aid because Hanoi was infiltrating new military equipment into South Vietnam, violating the cease-fire, and because it went on fighting in Cambodia. Yet, Saigon was equally guilty of cease-fire violations, and American B-52's had resumed the bombing of Cambodia. (Under the Paris agreement, the cease-fire did not apply to Cambodia.)  What we do not know is whether Hanoi had resolved to sacrifice American aid for tactical advantage or whether Mr. Nixon deliberately overreacted to the violations because of opposition at home to reconstruction aid. Likewise, one wonders whether Hanoi would have launched the victorious 1975 offensive if it had been receiving American assistance. The inner workings of the Hanoi leadership have always been a mystery.  Between 1975 and 1978, new opportunities developed. For more than two years, Vietnam had resisted Soviet demands for military facilities at Cam Ranh Bay and Danang, seemingly keen on maximum independence, while sending signals to Washington that it wished to normalize relations. By 1977, the Carter Administration responded favorably. Curiously, however, Hanoi wanted American aid as ''reparations,'' an unacceptable notion. Hanoi abandoned that idea in 1978, but by then it was too late: Congress already had forbidden all aid to Vietnam, and Jimmy Carter was moving ahead toward normalization with Peking, now hostile to Hanoi.  Late in 1978, Vietnam joined Comecon, the Communist common market, and signed a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union.  Then it invaded Cambodia to overthrow the bloody, China-backed Pol Pot regime, and installed Heng Samrin as its puppet. Early in 1979, Vietnam granted the bases to the Soviet Union, greatly facilitating its naval operations between the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. In February, China attacked Vietnam in an inconclusive border war.  Vietnam's destiny as a Soviet ally was sealed.  The consequences for Vietnam have been awesome. The Cambodian war, now in its fifth year, is tying down 200,000 Vietnamese troops unable to defeat local guerrillas (and there are 60,000 troops in Laos fighting Hmong tribesmen). Economically, Vietnam is barely surviving despite $ 2 billion annually in Soviet aid. Per capita income fell from $ 241 in 1976 to $ 153 in 1981. Millions of Vietnamese have fled the country; a half-million are working in the Soviet Union. The septuagenarian Hanoi leadership is frozen in immobility, unable to cope with its problems.  This is Vietnam 10 years after the ""peace"" of Paris.

"      Mary Rose of Birmingham, Ala., still wakes up in the middle of the night and imagines that her son, Capt. Scott Ketchie, is alive in a prison camp in Vietnam.  ''He was a navigator on an A-6, shot down in 1972 over the Ho Chi Minh trail,'' Mrs. Rose, who is no longer married to Scott's father, said quietly. ''The pilot was rescued, parachuted out of the plane with Scott. But Scott was never found.'' She shrugged. ''Death is final, I could live with that, but Scott was my only child and, well, I guess I'll wait and hope forever.''  In the corner of a crowded lobby in the Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel, Patricia Maves of Portland, Ore., stood with her 11-year-old daughter, Camille. The girl was only 8 months old when her father, Capt. Richard A. Brett, was shot down over Laos while serving as a pilot on an F-111.  ''It's living with the uncertainty that's so hard,'' said Mrs.  Maves, who remarried recently. ''I think there's a possibility that some men may be alive somewhere, but not Richard. The uncertainty became too much for me and I guess I just decided that Richard had died.''  Kept Asking for Her Father  She said slowly, ''When Camille was 3 or 4 she kept asking for her father and I told her he was probably killed but nobody really knows and she said she was going to find him. Well that just tore me up. It brought up a lot of pain.''  The two women were among more than 500 relatives of Americans still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia who gathered today for the start of a two-day meeting to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Paris peace accords that ended United States participation in the war in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The meeting today was marked by a speech by William P. Clark, President Reagan's national security adviser, and an updating of reports on the fate of the missing given by officials of the sponsoring organization, the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.  The Air Force flew many of the relatives to Washington from 19 bases around the country and will fly them home Saturday without charge.  The mood of the wives and children and parents of the missing was often anguished. ''I doubt seriously that my husband is alive,'' said Susan Miller of Corpus Christi, Tex., whose husband, Curtis, an Air Force major, was shot down in an AC-130 over Laos in 1972. ''I would just like to see him back in Texas soil.''  Reports Treated Warily  Although officials of the organization insist that ''eyewitness reports'' and ''sightings'' by refugees indicate that some men are alive - and that the Vietnamese are withholding the remains of more than 400 Americans - Reagan Administration officials speak warily of reports about American prisoners still being alive in Southeast Asia.  Maj. Bob Shields, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Department of Defense ''operates on the assumption that some could be alive.'' He added: ''We don't have evidence that there are some alive, we don't have evidence that there aren't. But we have to press on as if some were alive.''  Mr. Clark, in his speech today, said, ''Information now in our possession disallows us from ruling out the possibiity that Americans are still being detained against their will.'' Mr. Clark noted that President Reagan would speak to the group on Friday, a decision that buoyed many of the families who assert that the Reagan Administration has shown far more interest in the issue than did the Carter and Ford Administrations.  ''We not only care deeply about our missing men and you, their families, but we are devoting our highest priority resources to the task of obtaining the release of any prisoners who may still be held, the fullest possible accounting of those missing, and the repatriation of remains of those who died serving our nation,'' said Mr. Clark.  Warning From Several Speakers  Vietnamese officials, including Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, have insisted that the Hanoi Government has retained neither American prisoners nor American remains, and that a substantial number of those listed as missing appear to have disappeared in jungle areas difficult to reach.  At meetings today, several speakers, including Mr. Clark, warned families against providing money - as some apparently had - to groups or mercenaries who said that they had seen American prisoners alive in Vietnam and were planning to rescue them in what the national security adviser termed ''private cross-border forays.''  ''Our experience is that such private groups operate under faulty intelligence,'' said Mr. Clark, who added that unscrupulous people sometimes take advantage of bereaved families.  After the speech and through the afternoon, many of the families drove to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial across the Potomac to examine the names of their fathers and sons. Kay Marker of San Antonio was planning to visit the memorial with her two children, Jeff and Suzanne, who were 3 years old and 15 months old when their father, Michael, an Army captain, was shot down in a reconnaissance aircraft in the demilitarized zone in March 1971.  ''He's not alive, I'm sure of that,'' said Mrs. Marker softly.  ''The children didn't even know their father. We just want him back, we want his body back.''  50 Amerasians Leave Vietnam  HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Jan. 27 (AP) - Fifty Amerasian children and their relatives left Vietnam en route to the United States today.

"      President Reagan today told families of American servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia that United States intelligence agencies were ''fully focused'' on the problem and that the goal of a full accounting was ''the highest national priority.''  ''The anguish you've suffered - the families of brave men listed as prisoners of war or as missing in action - is unspeakable, something the rest of us can never really know even in partial measure,'' Mr. Reagan said in an emotional meeting with more than 500 relatives, including wives, children and parents, of the missing Americans.  Appearing at a meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, Mr. Reagan stood in front of the bleak black flag of the organization and received a standing ovation when he said: ''Your vigil is over. Your Government is attentive and the intelligence assets of the United States are fully focused on this issue.''  Mr. Reagan's appearance at the meeting in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Crystal City, Virginia, near Washington, and the tone of his comments underlined his strong involvement since the late 1960's in the issue of Americans missing in action in Southeast Asia.  Mr. Reagan said that the ''full resources'' of the Government were committed to the goal of a full accounting of the 2,494 Americans who remained unaccounted for after the Vietnam War.

"      The Reagan Administration has become concerned that privately organized expeditions into Indochina in search of missing United States servicemen may upset delicate talks with Laos and Vietnam on efforts to recover more remains of Americans lost during the Vietnam War.  At least one armed expeditionary force, headed by a former United States Special Forces officer, entered Laos in recent months in search of Americans rumored still to be alive and held captive. The foray was unsuccessful and has been denounced by Laos, as well as Thailand, the country from which the expedition was mounted.  United States officials say that other forays have taken place and that they periodically receive rumors that still more expeditions are being planned. Families of missing men report having been asked, off and on, to give money for private expeditions and intelligencegathering activities.  Some 2,500 Americans are still missing from the war. American officials believe that most, if not all, are dead. United States combat involvement in the region ended in 1973.  Possibility Not Ruled Out  But the possibility that some of the men might still be alive and in prison, as refugees from Southeast Asia periodically report, has never been totally ruled out. In fact, several years ago, when negotiations with the Laotians and Vietnamese were getting nowhere, the United States Government reportedly sponsored its own search expedition. It returned empty-handed.  Since then, the negotiations have been more productive, according to American officials. The Laotians and Vietnamese have denied that any prisoners are still being held, but delegations from the United States have been received by both countries and the remains of a number of men have been returned.  The United States has no diplomatic relations with either Laos or Vietnam.  ''We have been making some progress and so these private raids are counterproductive,'' a White House official said after learning of the recent incursion into Laos. ''We've been encouraged up to now by what we've been hearing from the Laotians and, to a lesser extent, from the Vietnamese. We don't want to lose this headway. It's a delicate situation.''  One of the main goals of the negotiations with the Laotians is to win permission for American recovery experts to accompany Laotian officials on visits to several hundred sites where United States planes are known to have crashed during the war. About a fourth of the Americans still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia were lost in Laos.  Last week, during a convention of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, President Reagan said the United States Government had placed the ''highest national priority'' on obtaining a full accounting. His remarks were enthusiastically received by league members, some of whom had questioned the commitment of previous Presidents and had contributed money to private search efforts.  The league also heard from William P. Clark, the President's assistant for national security affairs, who said the Reagan Administration was ''resolutely opposed'' to private across-theborder forays. ''Such actions,'' he said, ''interfere with and damage legitimate efforts on a number of fronts. Our experience has been that such private initiatives operate with faulty or fabricated intelligence and lack even marginally adquate operational capabilities.''  The latest expedition into Laos took place in late November and involved several Americans and about a dozen sympathetic Laotian guerrillas. The group, reportedly led by James G. Gritz of Los Angeles, a former lieutenant colonel in the Special Forces and a Vietnam War veteran, went in search of 120 Americans who refugees had said were being held in prison.  Shortly after crossing into Laos from Thailand, the group was fired upon. It suffered casualties and withdrew.

"    ANGELES, Feb. 10   On the sun-dappled campus of the University of Southern California, the Vietnam War issue was refought this week at an academic conference with some of the anger and confusion that surrounded the war itself.  The four-day meeting on the lessons of Vietnam was supposed to be a dispassionate analysis of the war, 10 years after the signing of the Paris peace accords and the withdrawal of the last American combat forces, in January 1973.  The 65 participants included some of the best-known Vietnam journalists and antiwar activists, with a sprinking of former generals and Government officials. Among them were Frances FitzGerald, author of the best-selling ''Fire in the Lake,'' and Daniel Ellsberg, who says he gave the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times.  But instead the conference was often emotional and acrimonious, and the main lesson that emerged was that ''Vietnam is not over,'' in the words of Daniel K. Wagoner, a former Army Ranger who served in Vietnam in 1969.  'Will Never Be Over'  ''Vietnam will never be over,'' said Mr. Wagoner, who was angry that as a veteran he had to pay to attend the conference and so, with a group of other veterans, used his Ranger training to crash a dinner for the participants. ''Rangers don't die, they recon the valley of death,'' Mr. Wagoner said in the macabre argot of Vietnam.  The meetings, which were held in a densely packed campus theater and which ended last night, provided a forum for people to bear witness to the wounds and divisiveness of the war.  Journalists clashed with one another over how accurate their reporting of the war was. A former general contended that Washington had hamstrung the military by not giving it enough troops or authority to cut off North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia. Three former agents of the Central Intelligence Agency said they knew how the agency planted false information with well-known journalists to mislead American opinion about the war.  Vietnamese refugees shouted at former antiwar activists sympathetic to Hanoi and asked why they did not show as much concern for the hundreds of thousands of people incarcerated by the Communists after the war and for the plight of the boat people.  Above all, dozens of Vietnam veterans, some in worn Army field jackets and others in three-piece business suits, berated the Government, the press and the American public for ignoring them.  'Too Late to Punish Anybody'  ''It's too late to punish anybody for what happened, but we have got to make the Government do something to help these people,'' Nicholas Road, a former paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division, said after a panel discussion on veterans' problems. ''I'm still trying to catch about 10 years of my life that I lost after my 19th birthday.''  Long lines formed after each panel discussion as members of the audience took over the microphone and delivered their own speeches, delaying some sessions till midnight.  ''For the past three days I've listened to some of the most selfrighteous S.O.B.'s tell us about how they reported the war,'' said another veteran, Rick Berg. ''We've been trying to talk for years. But they've been talking for us. What is this?''  Among the scheduled speakers were David Halberstam, a former New York Times correspondent in Vietnam and author of ''The Best and the Brightest''; Harrison Salisbury, a former Times editor who was among the first reporters to visit Hanoi in the war; Peter Arnett, who won two Pulitzer Prizes while reporting on Vietnam for The Associated Press, and Morley Safer of CBS News.  Some Quiet Insights  Amid the hostility and the hisses, there were also some quiet insights and reflective questions.  William Shawcross, a writer for The Sunday Times of London and author of ''Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia,'' wondered how the Communist Government of Vietnam had gone so astray after the war. He noted that given the damage and dislocations of the war, any government would have had trouble in Vietnam after 1975.  But why, he asked, does Vietnam maintain the third largest army in the world, bigger even than that of the United States, devoting 46 percent of its national budget to the military? Why does Vietnam have 200,000 troops occupying Cambodia and 40,000 more in Laos? Why did the North Vietnamese after the war ignore the leaders of the National Liberation Front, the Vietcong, in the South.  John McAuliff, director of the Indochina program of the American Friends Service Committee, contended that while most Americans blamed Hanoi for Vietnam's postwar plight, the fault ''lies at least as much in Washington.'' He said that if Washington had lived up to the terms of the Paris peace agreement and provided postwar aid to Vietnam, the situation would be different.  Mr. McAuliff even suggested that American hostility toward Hanoi after the war might have contributed to the Communists' policy of imprisoning large numbers of former South Vietnamese soldiers and officials in ''re-education'' camps.  Recognition of Hanoi Urged  Washington should recognize Hanoi now to end what he called ''the third Indochina war'' and stop opposing Vietnamese nationalism.  But Douglas Pike, a retired Foreign Service officer who teaches about Vietnam at the University of California at Berkeley, charged that Vietnam's postwar troubles were attributable to the age, isolation and dogmatism of Vietnam's Communist Party Politburo.  Mr. Shawcross pointed out that, with the complexity of American ties with China and the nations of Southeast Asia, Hanoi would have to make some concession on its occupation of Cambodia for the United States to normalize relations with Vietnam now.  One of the most poignant moments of the conference came when Tran Quang Thuan, a former South Vietnamese senator and Buddhist activist, questioned Nguyen Ngoc Dung, Hanoi's deputy representative to the United Nations, about why several leading Buddhist monks had been imprisoned by the Communists.  Mrs. Dung, speaking by a radio hookup from New York, insisted that Hanoi allowed freedom of religion and that ''if they are in jail, it is because they are criminals.'' She called the question slanderous.  New Political Prisoners Cited  Don Luce, an antiwar writer who had focused attention on the plight of political prisoners held by the South Vietnamese regime of Nguyen Van Thieu, was challenged over his silence on the condition of political prisoners held by the Communists today.  Ginetta Sagan, a founder of Amnesty International in California who used to keep records of prisoners held by the Thieu Government, said to Mr. Luce, ''Unless we speak up, we are going to lose our credibility as defenders of human rights.'' Miss Sagan said she had become concerned about the Communists' detention of political prisoners after some leftist Vietnamese who had furnished her with information about prisoners during the war were themselves arrested after 1975.  On how America got involved in Vietnam, James C. Thomson, a member of National Security Council staff under President Johnson, suggested that beyond the factors usually cited, such as a belief in the need to contain Communism, there was a ''missionary impulse,'' the ''need to go good to others.'' After the Communist victory in China in 1949, this missionary zeal was transferred from China to Indochina, Mr. Thomson suggested, making for a brand of ''sentimental imperialism.''

"    Ten years ago today, I stood on the floodlit tarmac of Tan Son Nhut air base and watched as a group of 27 American prisoners of war were delivered to freedom by United States Army helicopters. The men had been picked up from a Communistcontrolled rubber plantation near the Cambodian border, and their arrival was the first tangible benefit for Americans of the Paris peace accords, signed in late January.  It was an emotional moment. Gen. Frederick C. Weyand, the last commander of United States forces in Vietnam, draped his arm around an Air Force colleague and confided, in tones just loud enough for me to hear, ''It's the greatest day we've ever had in Vietnam.''  There was a kind of resignation and finality about the remark, like a losing football team salvaging a share of its pride with a meaningless touchdown in the final moments of the game. So it was with Vietnam. With the signing of the Paris agreement and the return of our P.O.W.'s, we withdrew not only the last American combat forces from Vietnam, but also our slender remaining interest in the country.  The war itself, of course, sputtered on for another two years, until Saigon's stunning collapse in April 1975. But Americans went into a trance of collective amnesia. The Vietnam War was such an agonizing, divisive and baffling experience that we somehow resolved simply to forget it. Unlike the fall of Nationalist China to Mao Zedong in 1949, there were no postwar recriminations, no blame for who lost Vietnam. The shock had been so great that nobody wanted to know. As a result, Vietnam became not only the longest war in our history and the first war the United States had lost - it was also the most misunderstood war.  The big questions went unasked and unanswered: How did we get involved in Vietnam? Why did 57,939 Americans die there? Why did the Communists win? What were the lessons of the war?  But now, a decade after the last American troops left Saigon, Vietnam is sparking renewed interest - though without the explosive rancor of the 1960's and early 70's. The hottest star on television is Tom Selleck, who plays Magnum, an amiable private eye and Vietnam veteran whose exploits often involve flashbacks to his combat days in ''Nam.'' Public Television is planning an ambitious 13-hour series on the war, which it will show within a year. The dedication of the polished black granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington last November finally gave Vietnam veterans a respected if ambiguous place alongside the monuments to Jefferson, Lincoln and Washington.  Ultimately, the most important development may be the emergence of a small group of scholars, journalists and military specialists who have started to look afresh at the war. Drawing on new disclosures from Hanoi, the opening of documents in the Presidential libraries, the Pentagon Papers (which are still the best published source material on the war) and memoirs of some of the participants in the war, these writers have worked quietly, with the general public largely unaware of their research. For most of these scholars, their re-examination is not to prove whether Vietnam was or was not a ''noble cause,'' in President Reagan's phrase, but to find out what really happened and why. In the process, they are challenging some of the most cherished beliefs of both the right and the left.  Among the new findings are the following: As opposed to the public caricature of him as a warmonger, Lyndon Johnson was actually reluctant to become more deeply involved in Vietnam. He sent American troops to Vietnam not out of machismo, but out of fear that if he ''lost'' South Vietnam, Congress would not pass his Great Society programs.  Contrary to the American popular assumption that we could easily win, American Presidents from John Kennedy to Richard Nixon were never confident about our chances and, in fact, never had a plan to win in Vietnam. Instead, they did only the minimum necessary not to lose Vietnam during their own tenure in the White House. They tried to fight a war on the cheap against a foe, North Vietnam, whose commitment was total. Under the restrictions imposed by the Presidents, some American generals knew almost from the start that they could not win the war. Without permission to cut off Hanoi's use of Laos and Cambodia, they realized, the critical strategic initiative remained in Hanoi's hands. Many officers now believe the Joint Chiefs of Staff should have resigned in protest. Both hawks and liberals were wrong about the Communists in Vietnam. While successive Administrations did not understand that the Communists' appeal had its roots in centuries of Vietnamese xenophobia, many antiwar critics - like Frances FitzGerald in her bestselling ''Fire in the Lake'' - over-glamorized the Vietcong, the Southern insurgents, and underestimated the role that North Vietnam played in leading the war in the South. The 1968 Tet offensive was a disastrous military defeat for the Communists, as Gen. William C. Westmoreland claimed, though most Americans regarded it as a setback for the United States. It was particularly brutal for the Vietcong, who bore the brunt of the fighting and who suffered such losses that thereafter they had to be replaced by North Vietnamese regulars, turning the conflict into a war between North and South.  After Tet - though most Americans at home had given up on the war -the cumulative weight of American firepower and spending in Vietnam dramatically undercut support for the Communists. As a result, the United States was probably in a stronger position in Vietnam in 1972, just before the Paris peace accords, than at any previous point in the war. The antiwar movement did not have as much impact on American policy as is popularly thought. Lyndon Johnson's decision in March 1968 to de-escalate the war was not so much a response to the peace movement as a result of disaffection within his Administration over the disastrous costs of the war. The protesters' main contribution, in fact, may have been to help elect Richard Nixon twice - in 1968 over Hubert Humphrey and in 1972 over George McGovern.  A NEW GENERATION DECRIES SCHOLARLY ARROGANCE  The picture of the Vietnam conflict that is emerging from the new research shows a war that was more complex, more morally ambiguous, than either the doves or the hawks had maintained. Of the war's many ironical twists, few match the postwar predicament of Communist Vietnam.  ''It was a war nobody won,'' says Stanley Karnow, a syndicated columnist, who covered Vietnam for several national publications. ''North Vietnam won, of course, but it also lost.'' Mr. Karnow - who is chief correspondent for Public Television's series on Vietnam and who is writing a book to accompany it - was in Hanoi in 1981 to film some interviews for the series. He remembers asking Prime Minister Pham Van Dong what Vietnam's main problem now is. ''He laughed,'' recalls Mr. Karnow. '' 'That's a stupid question. Look around, you can see for yourself what problems we're having.' ''  Hanoi's grim postwar record has raised a serious problem for scholars. How much should it be taken into account when the war is analyzed? Can events during the war be interpreted in the light of the Communists' postwar detention of 50,000 to 100,000 former supporters of the Saigon regime in ''re-education'' camps, the corruption and economic mismanagement by Communist officials, the invasion of Cambodia, the persecution of Vietnam's large Chinese ethnic minority and the flight of the boat people?  David W.P. Elliott, an assistant professor of political science at Pomona College in California, believes that Vietnam's postwar record is irrelevant to understanding the war. ''We shouldn't commit the historicist fallacy of reading the present into the past,'' says Mr. Elliott. ''In 1975, the people wanted peace.'' Like many of the new scholars, Mr. Elliott's interest in Vietnam goes back to the 1960's. He learned Vietnamese in the Army and later did research on the Vietcong for the Rand Corporation, a private research organization working mostly for the Defense Department.  One of the few Vietnamese now teaching in the United States, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, an assistant professor of history at Harvard, agrees that the Communists' postwar failures ''do not vindicate America's crusade in Vietnam.'' For a part of Vietnam's troubles today were caused by the dislocations of the war. But Mrs. Tai, who came to the United States as a student at Brandeis, maintains that what has happened since 1975 offers an important perspective.  ''During the war,'' she says, ''people looked at the Communists and said they were dedicated, driven and omnicompetent. Now we see them as corrupt and incompetent.'' Did the Communists change so much after 1975 or were Americans grossly mistaken in their earlier impressions?  Mrs. Tai believes that many Americans allowed their political passions to cloud their intellect. At the time of the war, she says, ''it was fashionable to think that a guerrilla movement needed popular support to succeed, and that if the Vietcong survived, therefore they must have popular support.'' But that, Mrs. Tai contends, was a fallacious argument. ''You can see how wrong it was now, because the Communists certainly aren't popular in the South.'' Or, she suggests, look at Cambodia. ''Pol Pot came to power as a guerrilla, but looking at what he did to his country, you'd think twice before saying he was popular.''  Mrs. Tai herself cannot be accused of being an inveterate anti-Communist. Her father was a founder of the Trotskyite party in Vietnam; an aunt was a senior official in the Vietcong's Provisional Revolutionary Government. But she has long had reservations about those antiwar protesters who were too ready to turn the Vietnamese Communists into paragons of virtue and who refused to accept a view of the war that was not black and white.  At Brandeis, she remembers, a professor asked her in class what the Vietnamese thought of the war. When she said that it was a difficult question to answer, since the view of an intellectual was probably very different from that of a peasant, the professor became angry. ''Later,'' she says, ''a student told me that my views didn't count because I was a bourgeois. I said, 'I'm sorry; I'm a human being. There are several hundred thousand members of the middle class in Vietnam.'  ''  This kind of academic narrow-mindedness, in Mrs. Tai's view, contributed to American misunderstanding of Vietnam just as much as ignorance in the White House and the State Department.  Until quite recently, Vietnam has been a giant black hole in American academia. A survey byin 1970 found that there was no scholar in the United States who devoted most of his or her time to studying North Vietnam; there was no American university with a tenured professorship in Vietnamese studies, and there were fewer than 30 students in the country studying the Vietnamese language. By comparison, there were three times that many studying Thai. According to the Social Science Research Council in New York, from 1951 to 1981 a total of 820 Americans applied to it for financial aid to work on Ph.D. dissertations in Southeast Asia. Of these, only 33 were for Vietnam, almost the same number as for Burma.  John K. Fairbank, professor emeritus of history at Harvard and the man generally recognized as the founder of modern Chinese studies in the United States, refers to this lack of expertise on Vietnam as an academic Pearl Harbor. One reason for this blind spot, he suggests, was that the French excluded American missionaries and businessmen from Vietnam, and Americans therefore did not have a personal stake in Vietnam.  However, by the time the United States became militarily involved, many academics considered the war so immoral that dispassionate analysis of the conflict became almost impossible. Only a handful of scholars actually went to Vietnam to do research there.  One of them was Samuel L. Popkin, now an associate professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego. After he spent time in 1966 conducting interviews in Vietnamese villages, he was treated as a pariah when he returned to Harvard, where he was then an assistant professor.  His problem: He had returned from Vietnam with a complex view. He did not approve of the way the Americans were fighting the war - ''this crazy chasing around in the villages with our massive firepower looking for body counts'' - but he did not find that the Communists were the popular good guys of American antiwar mythology.  Mr. Popkin's friends in Cambridge didn't want to hear about this. He got back in his colleagues' good graces only after he was jailed in 1972 for refusing to testify before a special grand jury set up by the White House to find out who leaked the Pentagon Papers - the Pentagon's massive top-secret study of American involvement in Indochina from World War II to May 1968 - to The New York Times.  Douglas Pike, who throughout the war years was the resident expert in the United States Embassy in Saigon on the Vietnamese Communists, remembers a similar encounter with academic close-mindedness when he was on leave in Cambridge, Mass., in 1964 to write a book about the Vietcong. He had been invited to take part in an antiwar teach-in and found himself debating with a professor from the Harvard Dental School. ''The professor really didn't have his facts straight, so I asked him if he had ever been to Vietnam,'' Mr. Pike recalls.  '' 'No, that's not necessary,' the professor replied. ''So I said, 'I've never been to dental school, but suppose I give you a root canal.' '' 'That's different,' he said. ''I replied, 'How at Harvard, of all places, can you say knowledge is not important?' '' Mr. Pike has now retired from the Government and is the first director of the Indochina studies program at the University of California at Berkeley -an appointment that would have been unthinkable a decade ago at a campus that was in the vanguard of the antiwar movement. Mr. Pike has just completed a book on the North Vietnamese Army, which he wrote after discovering to his amazement that there was no comparable study. ''We never even knew the names of North Vietnam's generals or what their strategic thinking was,'' he says. ''It shows how ignorant and arrogant we were. We just assumed we would win.'' Mr. Pike's presence at Berkeley, where he is setting up a two-million-page archive on Indochina, is testament to Vietnam's having quietly made the transition from controversial public issue to history. Was victory by the Communists inevitable? Since the end of the war, some of the best new scholarship has focused on the origins of the Communist movement in Vietnam and its reasons for success. According to one school of thought, the Communists' early capture of the nationalist issue made their eventual victory a foregone conclusion. David G. Marr - a visiting professor at Cornell last fall who is now teaching at the Australian National University in Canberra - has shown how the Communists under Ho Chi Minh were able to build their strength in the 1930's and 40's by appealing to the centuriesold tradition of Vietnamese nationalism. Mr. Marr's two books, ''Vietnamese Anti-Colonialism, 1885-1925'' (1971) and ''Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945'' (1981), are widely regarded as models of scholarly research.  In his view, ''the most important development of the entire conflict was the August 1945 revolution,'' when the Vietminh (the Communist-led guerrillas who had fought against the French) under Ho Chi Minh seized Hanoi and proclaimed an independent Vietnam before the French could re-establish their presence at the end of World War II.  ''Everything done after that by the French and the Americans was an attempt to turn back the clock, but they couldn't succeed,'' adds Mr. Marr, a former leading antiwar activist who is one of the few professors with military experience in Vietnam; he learned Vietnamese in the Marines. ''The outcome was predetermined. For the Communists were able to gain and hold legitimacy as a patriotic front.''  Says Professor Elliott of Pomona College, ''In 1945, the Vietminh clearly had overwhelming popular support - even the United States at first recognized this'' (an O.S.S. team had worked with Ho at the time). ''The Vietminh,'' he continues, ''won the war again in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu, and the Communists won it a third time in early 1965, before Johnson's commitment of U.S. ground forces.''  Mr. Popkin, among others, disagrees with this kind of deterministic interpretation. ''It's anti-intellectual; it doesn't allow for the normal process of change which occurs in history,'' he counters. ''If you argue that the Communists should have won the war in 1975 because they were the most popular group in 1945, does that mean that we should have a Democratic President today because Roosevelt was elected in 1944?'' Mr. Popkin himself is a liberal Democrat.  A very different view of the relations between Peking and Hanoi is also emerging. Early in the war, some Administration officials, like then Secretary of State Dean Rusk, contended that American commitment was necessary because North Vietnam was acting as an agent of Chinese Communist aggression. But if American diplomacy was able to salvage anything of value from the war, it was improved relations with China. The split between Hanoi and Peking grew out of centuries of enmity between the two countries and China's growing concern that the Vietnamese Communists were aligning themselves with the Soviet Union, China's erstwhile ally.  The break between North Vietnam and China has produced intriguing new evidence about another long-disputed topic: Who was responsible for failing to hold the 1956 elections, which, under the terms of the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the French Indochina war, would have reunified North and South Vietnam?  In the past, many liberal antiwar critics blamed the Eisenhower Administration for encouraging President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam to ignore the elections. They argued that it was only because of the provision for the elections that Ho Chi Minh had agreed to the temporary division of Vietnam at Geneva, and that when the elections were not held, the Communists had little choice but to resume the war. But Vietnam's leaders now claim that the Chinese actually cut off military aid to them in 1954 to compel them to negotiate with the French and accept the division of the country. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's Prime Minister, told Mr. Karnow that he had said at the time: ''The Chinese have betrayed us.'' And several scholars have found records indicating that Zhou Enlai, China's Prime Minister, expected the separation of Vietnam to be long lasting and turned down Ho's request in 1956 for help in arranging the elections. This does not exonerate Washington for its role in discouraging the elections, says Professor Tai, but it shows that the United States was not alone.  Disclosures from Hanoi since 1975 are also making possible a reexamination of the Vietcong's growth. During the war, the most influential academic account of the origins of the National Liberation Front (N.L.F.), the formal name for the Vietcong, was in a book by two Cornell professors, George McT. Kahin and John W. Lewis, ''The United States in Vietnam.'' The authors argued forcefully that the Vietcong was ''Southern rooted.''  After the Geneva settlement, the authors contended, the Communists withdrew all their armed troops to the newly created North Vietnam, leaving behind only political cadres. Hanoi favored only political, not armed, resistance to Ngo Dinh Diem. But given the ''harshness and heavy-handedness of Diem's Government'' these Southerners ''lost patience with the Communist North'' and organized an insurgency led by the N.L.F. ''Hanoi, despite its reluctance, was then obliged to sanction the Southerners' actions.''  Professors Kahin and Lewis also asserted that there was no evidence that Hanoi encouraged ''militant tactics by the Southerners'' until as late as September 1960, or, contrary to United States Government claims, that Hanoi directed the formation of the N.L.F., which was a broad united front of Communist and non-Communist organizations.  Scholars still agree that most of the early Vietcong were Southerners and that there were factional disputes in Hanoi over how to pursue the insurgency during the 1950's. But a history published by the People's Army of Vietnam in 1980, titled ''The Anti-U.S. Resistance War for National Salvation, 1954-1975: Military Events,'' contends that Hanoi played a large role in the development of the Vietcong. The history records, for example, that as early as 1957 ''cadres and men who remained behind'' in the South were able to form ''37 armed companies.''  Moreover, the history also admits that in a secret directive by the North Vietnamese Politburo in May 1959, Hanoi ordered its Southern supporters to switch from political action to armed struggle. To provide help for the new fighting, Hanoi established a special task force, code named Group 559, which set up infiltration routes and moved ''people, weapons and supplies'' through Laos into South Vietnam.  When the N.L.F. was proclaimed in December 1960, this official Communist history goes on, it was done at the order of the party in Hanoi, and the Front's program ''followed the line delineated by our party.'' These actions marked a critical turning point in the war, leading to the formation of bigger Vietcong units and an increase in attacks on South Vietnamese Government posts. It was this stepped-up activity that confronted President Kennedy when he took office in 1961 and led him to increase the number of American advisers in South Vietnam.  On another critical question, too, the Communists have been more candid since the end of the war: When did they begin sending regular North Vietnamese troops into the South?  Washington had long maintained that Hanoi started infiltrating its regular army units in the fall of 1964, prompting President Johnson's decision to begin bombing North Vietnam and then to dispatch American ground forces to South Vietnam a few months later. Hanoi denied it had troops in the South until virtually the end of the war. When I visited North Vietnam in 1969, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said with a straight face that there were no Northern troops in the South. And antiwar activists dismissed State Department white papers on Northern infiltration. But when Mr. Karnow interviewed officials in Hanoi in 1981, they talked about enlarging the Ho Chi Minh Trail as early as 1964.  All this leads to another question raised by the new scholarship: Were Americans, grown suspicious of their own Government, too eager to accept as truth whatever the Vietnamese Communists said? Throughout the war, there was heated debate over the degree of autonomy the N.L.F. enjoyed. Was it merely a puppet of North Vietnam, as many American officials insisted, or was it an independent organization, as the Communists claimed? The argument was important, because if the N.L.F. was independent, there might had been a chance for a negotiated settlement in the South.  Harrison E. Salisbury, who was among the first correspondents allowed to visit Hanoi in late 1966, made a strong case for the independence of the N.L.F. in his book ''Behind the Lines - Hanoi.'' The N.L.F., Mr. Salisbury wrote, ''had a government. It had a cabinet ... its own troops, its own generals, its own petty officials ... .''  From talks with an N.L.F. official in Hanoi, Mr. Salisbury said, he learned that the Front got its weapons directly from the Soviet Union and China and did not ''utilize Hanoi as a middleman.'' ''All military decisions in the South were the responsibility of the South.'' When Mr. Salisbury quizzed Prime Minister Dong on what would happen when the war was over, the Prime Minister assured him that the North would not annex the South: ''Reunification would only be by mutual agreement.'' Mr. Salisbury came away convinced that American officials who derided the N.L.F. were missing ''genuine possibilities'' for peace.  Asked recently if he might have been misled by the Communists, Mr. Salisbury said, ''I'll stand by my reporting of the time.'' But, he added, he had been in Hanoi in early 1967 and ''by the time the war finally ended the situation was so vastly different that whatever had been said by myself, or Hanoi, or L.B.J. or anybody in the N.L.F. really had very little validity.''  Since the war, some members of the N.L.F. have contended they themselves had been deceived by Hanoi. Writing last fall in The New York Review of Books, Truong Nhu Tang, the former Minister of Justice in the N.L.F.'s government and a French-educated ''independent socialist,'' indicated that he joined the Vietcong because he believed the Communists' promises that they would work for an autonomous, democratic South. At the end of the war, Hanoi annexed the South and the N.L.F. was disbanded.  At ''the simple farewell dinner'' held to disband the N.L.F. in 1976, Mr. Tang recalled, neither the party nor the Government bothered to send a representative. ''I was tragically wrong'' about the Communists, he wrote. ''The North Vietnamese Communists, survivors of protracted, blood-drenched campaigns against colonialism, interventionism and human oppression, became in their turn colonialists, interventionists and architects of one of the world's most rigid re-gimes.'' For the first time in Vietnam's history, Mr. Tang went on, people risked their lives to flee the country -something they had not done under the French or the Americans. Mr. Tang himself escaped by boat in 1979 and now lives in Paris.  American antiwar writers had envisioned a far happier future for Vietnam. One such writer was Frances FitzGerald, who wrote ''Fire in the Lake,'' a book that was both the most widely read and most highly acclaimed volume to come out of the war. (It won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Bancroft Prize in history in 1973.) In the lyrical closing passage, Miss FitzGerald prophesied: ''Pressure is building towards one of those sudden historical shifts when 'individualism' and its attendant corruption gives way to the discipline of the revolutionary community. When this shift takes place ... it will simply mean that the moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.''  ''Fire in the Lake'' had its critics from the start. Mr. Marr, the authority on Vietnamese nationalism, pointed out in a scholarly review at the time of the book's publication that Miss FitzGerald did not know Vietnamese and charged that her depiction of Vietnamese national character was ''little short of disastrous.'' Mr. Popkin at San Diego suspects she was ''swept away by a love affair with the N.L.F.'' and that her belief that the Vietnamese would be happier under the Communists was ''racist and condescending.''  Miss FitzGerald rejects the charge that she was too romantic about the Communists. ''I'd stick with it,'' she says. ''I think it's written in a rather romantic style; one chooses rhetorical modes to make people understand certain things.'' As for Vietnam's terrible postwar troubles, she insists they are the result of the damage caused by the war, though she concedes the Communists have proved inept at running the economy.  POLITICAL COMPROMISES  What went wrong on the American side? Today, the one common note sounded by virtually all scholars is the need to start searching for the answer with President Truman's decision in 1945 to reverse Washington's earlier support for Ho Chi Minh. It was a choice made out of concern for bolstering France in Europe against the looming Soviet menace.  ''In class,'' says Robert A. Scalapino, director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, ''I always stress that the history of American involvement in Vietnam was a series of decisions which cumulatively narrowed the choices for each succeeding President. No President was able to begin afresh with Vietnam.''  Professor Scalapino had a reputation as a conservative during the war, but Professor George Kahin, who was an outspoken critic of the war, and was until recently director of Cornell's Southeast Asia program, shares his view. In a new study of American involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 -which he says is based on trips to Vietnam in the 60's and extensive original research in Government files - Professor Kahin claims he will prove that Washington actually began giving secret military aid to the French for Vietnam in the late 1940's.  ''This aid was officially shown in the records as going to Europe, but it was subverted to Vietnam by the French with U.S. understanding,'' says Professor Kahin. Most history books date the origin of American involvement in Vietnam from a decision by President Truman's National Security Council in 1950 to provide military aid for the French war in Indochina.  Another key turning point whose significance was not appreciated at the time, historians now believe, was the 1963 coup against President Diem. Because the Kennedy Administration sanctioned the coup, Washington became morally and politically responsible for all the regimes that succeeded it, wrote Larry Berman in a new book, ''Planning a Tragedy: The Americanization of the War in Vietnam'' (1982).  Mr. Berman, an associate professor of political science at the University of California at Davis, is one of several writers now offering a more sympathetic portrait of Lyndon Johnson's role in the war. His book focuses on the decision-making process that led up to President Johnson's announcement on July 28, 1965, that he was increasing the number of American troops in Vietnam from 75,000 to 125,000, with additional forces to be deployed as necessary. This move is generally regarded as the critical decision that led to open-ended escalation.  Like a number of the new scholars, Mr. Berman was not trained in Vietnamese studies but is a specialist on the American Presidency. His book is based on recently declassified White House documents he found while doing other research in the Johnson Library in Austin, Tex.  Nowhere in the documents was there evidence that President Johnson had a plan either for winning the war or for getting out. The reason for the absence of any coherent strategic plan is that President Johnson was trying to save his Great Society, not Vietnam. By an accident of history, in July 1965 both Medicare and the Civil Rights Act of 1965 were at crucial stages in Congressional committees; the Model Cities Act and the Higher Education Act were soon to follow. Lyndon Johnson was caught in a dilemma. ''He didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them,'' Mr. Berman wrote. ''He really wanted to be the next face on Mount Rushmore.'' But the Communists were close to victory in Vietnam in early 1965, and President Johnson could not leave himself open to a charge by conservatives that he lost the war. On the other hand, if he took the steps the Pentagon urged - mobilizing the Reserves, for instance - Congressional liberals might have retaliated by withdrawing support for his Great Society programs.  ''So Johnson chose a middle course, to fight the war at the lowest possible cost, on the cheap,'' Mr. Berman went on. ''And he lied about what he was doing. He staged a debate to create a war climate, so that when he announced the number of troops was only going up from 75,000 to 125,000, he looked like a moderate. But he knew there would be 300,000 troops in Vietnam in 1966.''  ''We get a tragic historical figure who had to choose between guns and butter and couldn't,'' Mr. Berman continued. ''In the end, he neither settled the war nor got his Great Society, since as he fought in Vietnam, it drained the money needed for his domestic programs.''  Mr. Berman's thesis is similar to that in a book widely regarded by scholars as a seminal study of America's role in Vietnam - ''The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked'' (1979), by Leslie H. Gelb, now a correspondent for The New York Times, and Richard K. Betts, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. For this work, the authors drew heavily on the Pentagon Papers, which provided critical new groundwork for analyzing Washington's decision-making process. Mr. Gelb himself was director of the Pentagon Papers project within the Defense Department.  Mr. Gelb and Mr. Betts challenge the old liberal view put forward in books, such as David Halberstam's best seller ''The Best and the Brightest,'' that the United States stumbled into a quagmire in Vietnam through hubris and miscalculation.  Instead, they argue, Washington's planning machinery worked well, providing facts and options for the President. Rarely were the policy makers deluded that the odds for success in Vietnam were high. The trouble was that the Presidents, from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon, were afraid both to risk losing Vietnam to the Communists and to accept the decisive recommendations of their military advisers, which could lead to war with China or a domestic backlash. So they chose the in-between option, doing only what was necessary to stave off a Communist takeover at the time. This prevented a Communist victory till 1975. But their policies of gradual escalation played into the hands of the North Vietnamese, whose strategy was to drag out the war and make it increasingly costly to the United States.  In effect, the Presidents chose to ''nibble the bullet rather than bite it,'' Mr. Betts said at a conference on ''The U.S. Experience in Vietnam'' held last month at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.  Another factor in Washington's decision making, scholars now say, was that in the 1960's American political scientists were fascinated by theories of how the United States could effectively fight limited wars, as opposed to all-out conventional or nuclear wars. Theorists explored the question of how a nation could use force or the threat of force to compel its adversary to back down. Implicit in their theories was the idea that it was possible to signal your opponent by gradually increasing threats.  In another new study, ''When Governments Collide: Coercion and Diplomacy in the Vietnam Conflict, 1964-1968'' (1980), Wallace J. Thies has shown how President Johnson and his advisers believed they could ''fine-tune'' the bombing and their peace offers to ''signal'' Hanoi to abandon its support for the Vietcong. But President Johnson's program suffered from two serious flaws, argues Mr. Thies, a professor of political science at Berkeley.  First of all, in a bureaucracy as large as the American Government, it proved impossible to ''orchestrate'' our bombing and diplomacy. For example, the selection and timing of bombing targets often depended on extraneous factors like the weather; coordination between the Air Force and diplomats was difficult. As a result, what Washington intended to be a show of firmness often appeared to Hanoi to be vacillation or weakness.  Second, Mr. Thies contends, Washington had little understanding of politics in Hanoi and did not realize that the dominant group in the leadership, headed by Le Duan, the party First Secretary, had staked their careers on victory in the South after prolonged factional debate. By 1965, these men had already worked at infiltration and organizing the war in the South for many years. Like their American counterparts, they could not afford to be charged with losing South Vietnam.  Compared with the numerous new studies on the origins of American involvement in Vietnam, there has been little written on the war after 1966, and especially after the Tet offensive in 1968, largely because of the unavailability of materials. At the Johnson Library, relatively few documents have been declassified for the period after 1965, and given Federal budget cutbacks and the Reagan Administration's tightened procedures for declassification, library officials say further progress will be slow.  The situation is even worse for the Nixon years. There is no equivalent of the Pentagon Papers for Mr. Nixon's Presidency and there is no Nixon Presidential library yet. So scholars are heavily dependent on the memoirs of Mr. Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  One of the best accounts, however, has been pieced together by George C. Herring, a professor of American history at the University of Kentucky and author of ''America's Longest War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975'' (1979). Mr. Herring believes that President Nixon, like his predecessors, early on rejected calls for withdrawal - which he saw as dishonorable - and appeals for sharply increased escalation, feeling that he could solve a riddle that had baffled earlier Presidents.  Mr. Nixon's eventual strategy - Vietnamization -emerged on an improvised basis without a thorough policy review, Mr. Herring contends. In a paper written for the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, Mr. Herring charged that during the first year of his Administration Mr. Nixon's policy may have been ''a classic case of the President appeasing various bureaucratic constituencies by giving them a bit of what they wanted.'' The military got to bomb North Vietnam's sanctuaries in Cambodia; Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird got a speeded-up pull-out of American troops from Vietnam to appease American opinion (with Vietnamization, the war was turned over to the South Vietnamese Army - ARVN -which was given new training and improved weapons) and the State Department got negotiations with Hanoi. But Mr. Herring concludes that President Nixon's plan did not provide either enough force to compel North Vietnam to negotiate or sufficient concessions to entice Hanoi to the table. Like the improvised strategies of the Johnson era, ''it offered only extended stalemate.''  That there could be a negotiated end to the fighting was, throughout the war, one of the most consistent beliefs of both policy makers in Washington and their critics. But Allan E. Goodman, a professor at Georgetown University, believes this was naive. In another of the new books, ''The Lost Peace: America's Search for a Negotiated Settlement of the Vietnam War'' (1978), he argues that ''The real obstacle to a negotiated settlement was probably not Washington's diplomacy,'' but ''as Hanoi maintained ever since its first direct conversation with Washington in 1962, the liberation of South Vietnam was an absolutely indispensable prerequisite'' for a settlement.  In other words, North Vietnam was not prepared to compromise. Hanoi was further encouraged when American spokesmen assured it that American bombing of North Vietnam was not intended to destroy the country. The North Vietnamese were aware that the longer the war went on the more painful it was for the United States. So Hanoi waited for Washington to make the concessions.  In the end, this was what happened. ''Nearly every time Washington made a negotiating offer to Hanoi, the U.S. terms softened,'' Mr. Goodman wrote, until finally, in the Paris talks in 1972, Mr. Kissinger agreed that the United States would withdraw from Vietnam without obtaining a comparable pledge from Hanoi.  Without access to more documents from the period, it is impossible to judge if President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger believed the Paris accords gave South Vietnam a real chance to survive or whether they felt the agreement was merely a face-saving ''decent interval'' during which the United States could disentangle itself from Vietnam. Either way, America's exit from Vietnam proved as stumbling as its entry.  THE MILITARY CONFUSION  A conundrum that has baffled a generation of American military officers is this: The Army won every battle it fought against the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese, inflicting terrible losses on them. Yet Hanoi emerged the victor. When Col. Harry G. Summers Jr. was in Hanoi in 1975 as part of the American military delegation overseeing the Peace Accords, he mentioned to a North Vietnamese officer that the Communists had never defeated the Americans on the battlefield. The North Vietnamese colonel replied: ''That may be so, but it is also irrelevant.''  In the years since, Colonel Summers, an instructor at the Army War College at Carlisle, Pa., has found that, despite the welter of writing about Vietnam, few scholars have re-examined the military side of the war. To try to fill this void, Colonel Summers, who fought in Korea and served two tours in Vietnam, has turned out one of the most thoughtful and provocative military studies of the war, titled ''On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War'' (1982).  Unlike some senior American commanders, Colonel Summers does not blame the politicians, the protesters or the press for America's defeat. Instead, he finds flaws in the military's own approach. Most important, the Army simply lacked a strategy - an unforgivable sin for a soldier.  Instead of having a strategy, Colonel Summers argues, military and policy planners got carried away by the mystique of fighting a counterinsurgency war. In Colonel Summers's view, North Vietnam was the real opponent, but because Hanoi hid its involvement behind a smokescreen of guerrillas, the United States got tied down in fighting those insurgents. ''We were like a bull charging the toreador's cape,'' he comments.  The result was that the Army got caught up in General Westmoreland's search-and-destroy operations, which cost the lives of many American soldiers, outraged public opinion and did not deal with the real source of Communist strength - North Vietnam. Because of their helicopters and firepower, American forces may have had the tactical initiative, but they confused that with the strategic initiative, which Hanoi had all along.  Operating from their sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia, the Communists controlled the tempo of the fighting, and no matter how many Communists the Americans killed, success depended on the number of men Hanoi started down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In this war of attrition, North Vietnam could not be beaten as long as it was willing to pay the price.  Where most critics of American military policy in Vietnam have argued that the United States tried to fight a guerrilla war using conventional tactics, Colonel Summers contends - in one of his most controversial points -that it had always been a conventional war. The French in Indochina fought against a guerrilla army, he admits, but Hanoi's use of the Vietcong as proxies obfuscated the issue.  The United States could have had a strategy, Colonel Summers maintains. Since our goal was much the same as it had been in Korea, he believes, to stop the expansion of a Communist state, we could have pursued a Korean solution - cutting off North Vietnam from the South.  Quoting a plan first advanced by retired Gen. Bruce Palmer Jr., a former deputy commander of the American Army in Vietnam, Colonel Summers suggests that, with an expanded naval blockade, the army should have driven across the Demilitarized Zone between the two Vietnams and then cut through Laos to the Thai border, setting up defensive positions.  ''This would have had a number of advantages,'' says Colonel Summers. It would have required far fewer American troops. We could have fought on the defensive, making maximum use of our best asset, our firepower, and reducing our casualties. And it would have left rooting out the guerrillas to the South Vietnamese Army, which was best equipped to do it, and would have kept Americans out of the villages.  Colonel Summers rejects the argument that this strategy would have violated the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia, which he thinks was a fiction. ''The North Vietnamese never made a secret they were fighting an Indochina war,'' he says, and, in fact, the new North Vietnamese history of the war admits that Hanoi had ''volunteers'' in Laos as early as 1959. ''Neutrality was a myth we inflicted on ourselves,'' says Colonel Summers. He also quotes from the Hague Convention of 1907: ''A neutral country has the obligation not to allow its territory to be used by a belligerent. If the neutral country is unwilling or unable to prevent this, the other belligerent has the right to take appropriate counteraction.''  Colonel Summers also contends that the generals should have insisted that President Johnson get a Congressional declaration of war before committing American troops to Vietnam. President Johnson's attempt to fight the war on the cheap, without telling the public about its real costs, led to the credibility gap and helped spread the antiwar movement.  It was this lack of popular support for the war which also fostered the idea that the Vietnam War was more immoral than other wars, Colonel Summers believes. ''People talk about the picture of the little girl running down the road who got napalmed,'' he says. ''But tens of thousands of little girls got incinerated in the fire-bomb raids on Dresden and Tokyo in World War II and we don't remember. The difference is we believed World War II was legitimate.''  To underscore this point, Colonel Summers quotes from an article by General Weyand, the last American commander in Vietnam: ''As military professionals we must speak out, we must counsel our political leaders and alert the American public that there is no such thing as a 'splendid little war.' ... War is death and destruction. The American way of war is particularly violent, deadly and dreadful. We believe in using 'things' - artillery, bombs, massive firepower -in order to conserve our soldiers' lives. ... The Army must make the price of involvement clear before we get involved, so that America can weigh the probable costs of involvement against the dangers of noninvolvement. For there are worse things than war.'' Like a number of officers, Colonel Summers raises the question of why some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not resign in protest when they sensed the lack of a coherent strategy and President Johnson's attempt to fight the war with limited means.  At the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, retired Brig. Gen. Edwin H. Simmons, the director of Marine Corps History and Museums, said that he had asked some of the Chiefs the question himself. ''The inevitable answer is: They could work better from within,'' said General Simmons, who served two tours in Vietnam with the Marines. It was one of the distortions of the Vietnam War, he said, that some officers allowed the honored principle of civilian control of the military to come to mean civilian leadership and management of the military on the combat level in the field. Officers at all levels of command ''used civilian control as an exoneration from moral responsibility,'' he charged.  General Simmons is currently supervising a 10-volume official history of the Marines in Vietnam, one of a series of such projects by each of the armed services. Taken together, they consti-tute the most ambitious and detailed work now being done on the war. The largest in scope is a planned 20-volume series by the Army's Center of Military History in Washington.  The Army's earlier 80-volume history of World War II has received high marks from scholars for its integrity. But Vincent H. Demma -one of 10 historians selected to help write the Vietnam volumes and who has been working on the project since the mid-1960's - admits that victory is easier to record than defeat. Moreover, the writers face another problem, a wealth of documentation left over from a conflict that was not only the first television war, but also the first Xerox and computer war. In Suitland, Md., outside Washington, in a warehouse the size of three football fields, repose more than 60,000 cubic feet of records shipped home by the Army, mostly uncatalogued.  Mr. Demma hopes this material and other archives, including taperecorded interviews with officers as they left Vietnam, will someday furnish what is now missing - ''an understanding of the war from the foxhole up rather than from the policy makers down.'' Aside from some novels by ex-soldiers, very little has been written on the actual conduct of the war, says Mr. Demma. But he feels that the special access he and his fellow authors have to still-classified material, including that in the Presidential libraries and other Government organizations like the Central Intelligence Agency, should eventually provide a more accurate picture of Vietnam.  THE VIETNAM IGNORANCE  Despite all the blunders, a number of historians and military specialists are coming to conclude that the American military effort in Vietnam was more successful than was recognized at the time. When Mr. Popkin, for instance, returned to Vietnam in 1969 and 1970 to check on the villages he had studied in 1966, he was surprised to find that the balance of power in the countryside had shifted dramatically in the South Vietnamese Government's favor.  This was, in part, the result of the huge Communist mistake in the 1968 Tet offensive, when the best Vietcong units, which had long preserved their strength by operating clandestinely, exposed themselves in open attacks. They were decimated by American and South Vietnamese counterat-tacks. American officials estimated the Communists lost 40,000 killed in the Tet fighting, the bulk of them Southern guerrillas rather than North Vietnamese.  Mr. Tang, the former N.L.F. Minister of Justice, has described Tet as ''catastrophic''; he calculated the Vietcong lost half their forces and new recruits could not be found lo-cally to replace them. As a result, by the early 70's, 90 percent of the fighting was being done by North Vietnamese troops and the war turned more and more into a conventional conflict between North and South. (Mr. Pike and some other specialists have speculated that Hanoi may have deliberately allowed the Vietcong to be massacred at Tet to assure North Vietnam's control over the Communist movement in the South, much as the advancing Russian Army stood by during the Warsaw uprising in 1944.) But at the time, most Americans, shocked by the daring Vietcong attack on the United States Embassy in Saigon and the weeks of street fighting in Hue, felt Tet was a defeat for the United States. It led to President Johnson's announcement that he would not run again, his proclamation of a bombing halt over North Vietnam and his decision to stop the escalation of American ground forces. For most Americans, Tet was the beginning of the end of our involvement.  Even those American officials and journalists who claimed in 1968 that Tet was a military defeat for the Communists still tended to credit Hanoi with a masterful strategy -sacrificing troops to deal Washington a psychological blow. But that view, too, was wrong.  When he was in Vietnam for his television series, Mr. Karnow interviewed Tran Do, one of the Communist generals in charge of the Tet attacks. The general denied that Tet was designed to have a political impact in the United States; instead, he said, the Communists fully believed there would be popular uprisings and that they could ''annihilate the U.S. and Saigon troops.'' The political impact ''was an accidental byproduct,'' the general said. Major popular uprisings never took place.  Tet, in fact, ''totally destroyed the idea of the inevitability of an N.L.F. victory in the villages,'' says Mr. Popkin. ''When the villagers saw the stacks of Vietcong bodies in Saigon on their local TV sets, they rushed to get their sons into local defense forces'' so that they would not be drafted by the Vietcong.  At the same time, the sheer weight of American military spending and aid programs began to be felt. Many peasants rushed to work for the Americans, building roads, bridges, runways and schools. Typically, Mr. Popkin found, in the 18 villages he studied, the peasants used their earnings to buy a baby piglet, raised it, sold it, and with the profits invested in a diesel water pump to irrigate their rice fields. With these mechanized pumps the farmers in the Mekong Delta could at last get two rice crops a year, and the standard of living in the countryside started to take off.  In the early and mid-1960's, the peasants had had an economic incentive to live in a ''liberated'' or Communist village, Mr. Popkin found, because the Vietcong taxes were lower than the rent peasants had to pay landlords in Government-held areas. But by the time of Tet, the incentive was reversed. As the Vietcong's military situation grew more desperate, their taxes increased. And now that the peasants had pigs, chickens and rice they could sell in Government markets, they got angry when the Communists cut a road. ''The Vietcong may have been more honest than the Government, but they couldn't compete with water pumps, chemical fertilizer and Hondas,'' says Mr. Popkin. He has developed some of his ideas about the farmers' material interests in a book widely used in college courses, titled ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam'' (1979).  In the light of Hanoi's postwar revelations, specialists are revising even their views of the Phoenix program, the scheme sponsored by the C.I.A. to destroy the Vietcong apparatus in the villages by arresting or killing local Communist cadres. ''The conven tional liberal wisdom at the time was that it was a terrible thing,'' says Mr. Karnow. ''It killed people indiscriminately and was subject to corruption by the South Vietnamese who turned in people for the reward money. But the people I talked to on my trip in Vietnam said it had wiped out many Southern cadres and helped cripple the N.L.F.''  Overall, by 1970 nearly 90 percent of the countryside was officially ''pacified,'' compared with only 33 percent in 1965, a crude though significant index of change.  Professor Herring at the University of Kentucky has suggested that ''the ultimate irony'' of the war may be that the American position in South Vietnam was stronger at the end of 1972, just before the Paris peace agreement, than at any previous point in the war. Mr. Popkin concurs and adds, ''There's no doubt that if Nixon had kept up U.S. aid after 1973, South Vietnam might have survived.'' But that is one of the great historical ifs. American patience had run out.  What, then, went wrong after the Paris accords? Why did South Vietnam collapse in 1975 under a North Vietnamese attack that was designed only to prepare for a bigger, final offensive in 1976? (According to Douglas Pike, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the North Vietnamese commander, was so startled by the rapidity of the South Vietnamese retreat that he cautioned his officers in the field by radio against falling into a trap.) Clearly one problem was the poor leadership and corruption that bedeviled the Saigon Government throughout the war. But Professor Tai believes that in fairness we should recognize that Saigon faced problems Hanoi did not have. North Vietnam could forge a more disciplined state because its society was more homogeneous than that of the South. Most anti-Communists in the North moved to the South in 1954, and the North never had to deal with the South's fractious babble of sects like the Buddhists, the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai.  Mrs. Tai also believes that the American peace movement misunderstood how the South Vietnamese people felt. ''There were many people like me who did not support Thieu but who didn't like the Communists either,'' she says. Indeed, she represented the kind of third force that American officials in Saigon hoped would somehow emerge. ''I didn't think a Communist victory would lead to any improvement for the middle class, or even for the peasants, in whose name the revolution was fought,'' she says. In 1977, her father, despite his Communist background, was arrested for protesting the human-rights situation in Vietnam; he died of starvation in a ''reeducation'' camp in 1981.  On the basis of his village interviews, Mr. Popkin also came to a conclusion that the American left overrated the popularity of the Communists. With his training in polling, Mr. Popkin noticed a number of ''unobtrusive indicators.'' ''When you want to know what radio stations people are listening to,'' he says, ''you don't ask them. You just look in their cars at a parking lot to see where the dials are set.''  One sign was that while many South Vietnamese soldiers deserted to go home -just as Union troops did in the American Civil War - they did not defect in large units to the Communists. This was in sharp contrast to China, where during the 1940's whole Nationalist divisions defected to Mao Zedong's Communist guerrillas. Mr. Popkin noted, too, that in the Tet offensive, when the Communists' surprise attacks trapped many Americans in Vietnamese residential areas, very few were betrayed to the Communists.  ''It tells you,'' says Mr. Popkin, ''that the problem in Vietnam was not too much support for the Communists, or lack of support for the Saigon Government. It was just a rotten government. You can't fight something with nothing.''  Another reason for Saigon's collapse in 1975, South Vietnamese and American officials have long insisted, was the cutback in American aid mandated by a Congress which lost interest in the war after the G.I.'s had left in 1973.  American military aid to South Vietnam and Laos dropped from about $2.5 billion in 1973 to $1.6 billion in 1974 and then plunged further to a projected $700 million in 1975, half of it covering shipping costs. When Hanoi's attack came, South Vietnam's armed forces were receiving only 2 percent of the funds and supplies American soldiers had gotten in 1968 or 1969, according to retired Maj. Gen. John E. Murray, the chief American military administrator in Saigon in 1974. In other words, said Gen. Van Tien Dung, North Vietnam's field commander, in his memoir on the final offensive, the Thieu regime was compelled ''to fight a poor man's war,'' a fact that Hanoi took carefully into account.  ''You know what Napoleon said,'' General Murray pointed out at the conference on Vietnam in Washington. ''God is on the side of the biggest battalions. And right about then, God was on the side of the Communists. They were bigger, they were stronger. That's why ARVN lost the war.''  But there was something else at work. The huge American investment in Vietnam, Mr. Karnow points out, had ''lulled the South Vietnamese into believing that the United States would never leave. Nobody in his right mind would spend billions to build the complex at Cam Ranh Bay and then depart. The Americans must be crazy. They were crazy. The South Vietnamese were left holding the bag.''  Professor Elliott at Pomona College thinks this dependence is the key to understanding the war. ''It seems to me,'' he says, ''that the Communists had an appeal that prevented the South Vietnamese from coalescing around a non-Communist government. Because the Saigon regimes were always dependent on the United States, in the eyes of the nationalistic Vietnamese, this created a moral paralysis.'' Mr. Elliott says he could see this in interviews he conducted with Vietcong defectors in the Mekong Delta during the war. ''However much they had come to dislike the Communists, they acknowledged the Front had a moral appeal which undermined the Government.'' So the South Vietnamese faced an insoluble contradiction. ''They couldn't win without us, but they couldn't win with us either.''  THE ANTI WAR MOVEMENT  One group whose influence on Vietnam has been downgraded by the new scholars is the antiwar movement. From studying public-opinion polls, John E. Mueller, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester, has found that the Vietnam War was no more unpopular than the Korean War - until American casualties in Vietnam surpassed those in Korea. That line was crossed, coincidentally, during the Tet offensive. Professor Mueller believes that the tactics of some of the protesters, with flag burnings and anti-American slogans, actually undercut their credibility with the public. ''The antiwar movement picked up negative popularity ratings in an almost unprecedented degree,'' he says.  Washington was certainly aware of the protests, says Mr. Mueller, who has written about the subject in ''War, Presidents and Public Opinion'' (1973). But the Johnson Administration's about-faces in 1968 - stopping the bombing of North Vietnam and ending our troop escalation -had more to do with disaffection within the Government itself over how badly the war was going and its high costs, he asserts.  Another little-known reason for the Government's shift in 1968, Mr. Mueller has found, is that within the Government ''the value of saving Vietnam from Communism had gone down since we got committed in 1965.'' China, formerly seen as a threat, had become engulfed in the Cultural Revolution, and Indonesia, which had appeared on the brink of a Communist takeover, massacred its Communist Party.  Mr. Mueller also points out that President Johnson's near defeat by Senator Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, which influenced President Johnson's decision not to run again, was caused more by angry hawks than by doves. At the ballot box, anti-Johnson hawks outnumbered anti-Johnson doves by 3 to 2.  The protesters did have an effect on the Presidential elections. Their attacks on Vice President Humphrey ''probably gave Nixon the slim margin of votes necessary to win in 1968,'' says Mr. Mueller. Then, in 1972, with the Democratic convention controlled by opponents of the war, ''they picked George McGovern, arguably the worst choice as a Democratic candidate in modern times.''  But Mr. Mueller discounts the charge by hawks that the protest movement strengthened Hanoi's resolve and helped the United States lose Vietnam. ''Hanoi may have been encouraged by the peace movement,'' he says, ''but the North Vietnamese were fanatics who would have continued the war for as long as necessary to win.'' In another of his studies, Mr. Mueller estimated that the North Vietnamese and Vietcong suffered 500,000 to 600,000 battle deaths - about 2.5 percent to 3 percent of their prewar population. By comparison, the United States lost only three-tenths of 1 percent of its population in battle during World War II, and the Japanese, whom Americans regarded as true fanatics, 1.4 percent. ''The crucial mistake the U.S. made was to underestimate how much punishment North Vietnam would take,'' he says.  THE LESSON OF VIETNAM  Are there lessons Americans can learn from Vietnam? The question is important, because it was one of the supposed lessons of World War II -not to appease aggression - that helped get the United States into Vietnam. There is little consensus, however, on what can be gleaned from Vietnam. James C. Thomson Jr., curator at the Nieman Foundation at Harvard, who was a member of President Johnson's National Security Council staff and who opposed American involvement in Vietnam, has proposed that the ''central lesson'' is that we should never again ''take on the job of trying to defeat a nationalist anticolonial movement under indigenous Communist control in former French Indochina.'' This is, notes Mr. Thomson wryly, ''a lesson of less than universal significance.''  But Robert E. Osgood, a professor of American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, believes Americans have learned the danger of intervening in a revolutionary war where the local government is weak. In such cases, the United States must commit so many troops to compensate for the regime's shortcomings that it ends up only undermining the government. El Salvador is an example, says Professor Osgood, who was one of the most important theorists on limited war in the 1960's.  ''But this is not necessarily a lesson you can apply in every revolutionary war,'' he adds. In the Philippines after World War II, American aid provided a critical ''missing component'' that stopped a Communist insurgency. So to exclude American intervention in every contingency ''is probably overdrawing the lesson,'' he says.  The problem, in Professor Osgood's view, is that there are many variables for Washington to ponder: the strength of the local regime, the resolve of its adversary, the possibilities for getting out if American intervention proves unsuccessful.  The real issue is the magnitude of American interests and the threat to them. ''That was a mistake in Vietnam -our greatly inflated rhetoric about falling dominoes turned out to be wrong,'' Professor Osgood points out. But American foreign policy is still wedded to containment, and questions may arise again about combating a Communist-led revolution or takeover in the Middle East or Central America, he notes.  If that prospect arises, says Mr. Betts, we have not really learned what to do except that the United States can fight only if the war is kept short. ''We know more now,'' he believes, but we do not know how to avoid a disastrous war except at the possible price that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson foresaw -disastrous acceptance of defeat.  Another lesson is the need for better leadership, says Ernest R. May, a professor of history at Harvard. At the Washington conference on Vietnam, he recalled that in 1948 George C. Marshall, then Secretary of State, opposed a military proposal to send 10,000 American advisers to aid the Chinese Nationalists because it involved a commitment of uncertain magnitude and indefinite duration. ''What we did not have in 1965 was an individual of Marshall's stature and independent judgment,'' Mr. May said.  There are also lessons for small states that might look to the United States for help. At the Washington meeting, Bui Diem, who served as South Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States, issued a warning. ''My advice to small nations considering U.S. aid is that they should be wary of the United States,'' he said. ''They should pay very close attention to the American domestic political system, because U.S. policies can change quickly. We small nations can end up losing higher stakes than the United States itself because, for the American, you can turn the page and say, 'Well, it is an unhappy chapter for U.S. history.' But that is not the same now for the South Vietnamese.''  And there are lessons for the military. The most important, Colonel Summers believes, is that ''we must relearn that public support is critical to American military strategy.'' To make his point, Colonel Summers quotes from General Weyand, the man who welcomed the P.O.W.'s to Saigon in 1973. ''The American Army really is a people's army in the sense that it belongs to the American people,'' the general said. ''When the American people lose their commitment, it is futile to try to keep the Army committed. In the final analysis, the American Army is not so much an arm of the executive branch as it is an arm of the American people.''  TEACHING THE WAR  UP at the blackboard, a teaching assistant had chalked in the Names to be discussed in the day's lecture at the University of Iowa. There, in large letters, were Robert McNamara, and McGeorge Bundy, and Ngo Dinh Diem and the Green Berets.  Fifteen years ago, when Vietnam first invaded the American campus, they would all have been household words, objects of heated debate and perhaps derision. But to the 300 students in the large classroom, they were like something from an arcane novel, to be carefully copied down.  ''For the students, history begins about 1980,'' says Stephen Vlastos, a professor of history at the University of Iowa who is in charge of the course, ''The Vietnam War in Historical Perspective.'' Indeed, most of them were not even born at the time of the Americansupported coup against President Diem. Katharyn Bine, a freshman from Beaman, Iowa, a farming town of 209 people, was only 1 year old when Lyndon Johnson dispatched the first American ground forces to Vietnam in 1965. Before taking the course, she had heard the name Ho Chi Minh, but she had not known who Diem or McNamara or Bundy was.  Yet Miss Bine and the course at Iowa represent another development - a quiet revival of interest in Vietnam on campus 10 years after the last American troops were withdrawn. More than two dozen colleges this year are offering courses on the war or Vietnamese history, ranging from Harvard to Thomas More College in northern Kentucky. Almost all the classes have drawn more students than their professors expected.  What are the students learning? It seems to depend on the professor, his own view of Vietnam and the books he assigns. Not surprisingly, a majority of the professors were strongly influenced by the antiwar movement. Mr. Vlastos, for instance, helped organize a demonstration against President Johnson while he was an undergraduate at Princeton in 1966. He is candid about his antiwar sentiments. ''It's the reason I'm teaching the course,'' he says. ''At the beginning of the course, I told the students I believe the war was a terrible mistake.''  Professor Vlastos is also an example of another heritage of academic feeling about the war. Distaste for the war was so widespread that few academics specialized in Vietnam, and so today most of the new courses on Vietnam are being taught by professors who were trained in subjects like American history or Chinese studies. Mr. Vlastos got his Ph.D. from Berkeley in Japanese history.  Even more striking, though nearly three million Americans served in Vietnam, very few of the professors teaching about Vietnam were ever there. At a conference last fall on ''Vietnam and the Classroom'' in Kentucky, sponsored by the Kentucky Association of Teachers of History, only one of the 11 speakers and only three of the 75 participating teachers had been in Vietnam.  ''If we were talking about World War II, this room would be full of veterans,'' observed T. Wayne Beasley, a professor at Murray State University in western Kentucky. But, Mr. Beasley complained, ''with Vietnam you people who are teaching about it are the same people who were protesting it as students in the 1960's.''  At the Newark campus of Rutgers University, H. Bruce Franklin is worried about a different problem. Mr. Franklin, a professor of English, says he was distressed when he polled the students in his course, ''America and Vietnam,'' and found the majority believed the United States lost the war because ''we didn't try hard enough.'' ''This illusion has to be dispelled immediately,'' Mr. Franklin adds. So he stresses the damage the United States did to Vietnam, like bombing it between 1964 and 1969 with more than nine times the tonnage of high explosives dropped in the entire Pacific theater during World War II. Mr. Franklin rejects a suggestion that such figures may be misleading because many of the bombs dropped on Vietnam landed in the jungle, not on civilian villages.  Despite the prevalence of antiwar views among most professors, some teachers have begun to incorporate the more complex and dispassionate new scholarship into their curriculum. One of the most imaginative new classes is at the University of Louisville, taught by an unlikely duo: a hawkish former artillery officer in Vietnam, Richard N. Pfeiffer, and a confirmed antiwar activist with a Ph.D. in East Asian history, Andrea McElderry. Miss McElderry is an associate professor of history; Mr. Pfeiffer is a vice president of an industrial-supply company who teaches in his spare time.  ''The idea of the class is to give the students as many different points of view as we can about the war, because we don't think anyone has solved Vietnam,'' says Miss McElderry. ''We don't let our students say things like 'This side won the war.' ''  To broaden the course, the two teachers invite guest speakers from the Louisville area, including a former Green Beret, a retired Army general, a one-time high official in the Saigon Government, a peacemovement activist and a psychiatrist from a Veterans' Administration hospital who treats troubled veterans. Miss McElderry feels the unusual chemistry between her and Mr. Pfeiffer has been beneficial. ''Until I met Richard, I was sure of my views about Vietnam. He has made me rethink them, and I have influenced him, too. I couldn't have taught the course the same way with my Asian specialist colleagues, because all of them were getting 2-S student deferments during Vietnam.'' - F.B.

"    Ten years ago today, I stood on the floodlit tarmac of Tan Son Nhut air base and watched as a group of 27 American prisoners of war were delivered to freedom by United States Army helicopters. The men had been picked up from a Communistcontrolled rubber plantation near the Cambodian border, and their arrival was the first tangible benefit for Americans of the Paris peace accords, signed in late January.  It was an emotional moment. Gen. Frederick C. Weyand, the last commander of United States forces in Vietnam, draped his arm around an Air Force colleague and confided, in tones just loud enough for me to hear, ''It's the greatest day we've ever had in Vietnam.''  There was a kind of resignation and finality about the remark, like a losing football team salvaging a share of its pride with a meaningless touchdown in the final moments of the game. So it was with Vietnam. With the signing of the Paris agreement and the return of our P.O.W.'s, we withdrew not only the last American combat forces from Vietnam, but also our slender remaining interest in the country.  The war itself, of course, sputtered on for another two years, until Saigon's stunning collapse in April 1975. But Americans went into a trance of collective amnesia. The Vietnam War was such an agonizing, divisive and baffling experience that we somehow resolved simply to forget it. Unlike the fall of Nationalist China to Mao Zedong in 1949, there were no postwar recriminations, no blame for who lost Vietnam. The shock had been so great that nobody wanted to know. As a result, Vietnam became not only the longest war in our history and the first war the United States had lost - it was also the most misunderstood war.  The big questions went unasked and unanswered: How did we get involved in Vietnam? Why did 57,939 Americans die there? Why did the Communists win? What were the lessons of the war?  But now, a decade after the last American troops left Saigon, Vietnam is sparking renewed interest - though without the explosive rancor of the 1960's and early 70's. The hottest star on television is Tom Selleck, who plays Magnum, an amiable private eye and Vietnam veteran whose exploits often involve flashbacks to his combat days in ''Nam.'' Public Television is planning an ambitious 13-hour series on the war, which it will show within a year. The dedication of the polished black granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington last November finally gave Vietnam veterans a respected if ambiguous place alongside the monuments to Jefferson, Lincoln and Washington.  Ultimately, the most important development may be the emergence of a small group of scholars, journalists and military specialists who have started to look afresh at the war. Drawing on new disclosures from Hanoi, the opening of documents in the Presidential libraries, the Pentagon Papers (which are still the best published source material on the war) and memoirs of some of the participants in the war, these writers have worked quietly, with the general public largely unaware of their research. For most of these scholars, their re-examination is not to prove whether Vietnam was or was not a ''noble cause,'' in President Reagan's phrase, but to find out what really happened and why. In the process, they are challenging some of the most cherished beliefs of both the right and the left.  Among the new findings are the following: As opposed to the public caricature of him as a warmonger, Lyndon Johnson was actually reluctant to become more deeply involved in Vietnam. He sent American troops to Vietnam not out of machismo, but out of fear that if he ''lost'' South Vietnam, Congress would not pass his Great Society programs.  Contrary to the American popular assumption that we could easily win, American Presidents from John Kennedy to Richard Nixon were never confident about our chances and, in fact, never had a plan to win in Vietnam. Instead, they did only the minimum necessary not to lose Vietnam during their own tenure in the White House. They tried to fight a war on the cheap against a foe, North Vietnam, whose commitment was total.  Under the restrictions imposed by the Presidents, some American generals knew almost from the start that they could not win the war.  Without permission to cut off Hanoi's use of Laos and Cambodia, they realized, the critical strategic initiative remained in Hanoi's hands. Many officers now believe the Joint Chiefs of Staff should have resigned in protest. Both hawks and liberals were wrong about the Communists in Vietnam.  While successive Administrations did not understand that the Communists' appeal had its roots in centuries of Vietnamese xenophobia, many antiwar critics - like Frances FitzGerald in her bestselling ''Fire in the Lake'' - over-glamorized the Vietcong, the Southern insurgents, and underestimated the role that North Vietnam played in leading the war in the South.  The 1968 Tet offensive was a disastrous military defeat for the Communists, as Gen. William C. Westmoreland claimed, though most Americans regarded it as a setback for the United States. It was particularly brutal for the Vietcong, who bore the brunt of the fighting and who suffered such losses that thereafter they had to be replaced by North Vietnamese regulars, turning the conflict into a war between North and South.  After Tet - though most Americans at home had given up on the war - the cumulative weight of American firepower and spending in Vietnam dramatically undercut support for the Communists. As a result, the United States was probably in a stronger position in Vietnam in 1972, just before the Paris peace accords, than at any previous point in the war.  The antiwar movement did not have as much impact on American policy as is popularly thought. Lyndon Johnson's decision in March 1968 to de-escalate the war was not so much a response to the peace movement as a result of disaffection within his Administration over the disastrous costs of the war. The protesters' main contribution, in fact, may have been to help elect Richard Nixon twice - in 1968 over Hubert Humphrey and in 1972 over George McGovern.  The picture of the Vietnam conflict that is emerging from the new research shows a war that was more complex, more morally ambiguous, than either the doves or the hawks had maintained. Of the war's many ironical twists, few match the postwar predicament of Communist Vietnam.  ''It was a war nobody won,'' says Stanley Karnow, a syndicated columnist, who covered Vietnam for several national publications.  ''North Vietnam won, of course, but it also lost.'' Mr. Karnow - who is chief correspondent for Public Television's series on Vietnam and who is writing a book to accompany it - was in Hanoi in 1981 to film some interviews for the series. He remembers asking Prime Minister Pham Van Dong what Vietnam's main problem now is. ''He laughed,'' recalls Mr. Karnow. '' 'That's a stupid question. Look around, you can see for yourself what problems we're having.' ''  Hanoi's grim postwar record has raised a serious problem for scholars. How much should it be taken into account when the war is analyzed? Can events during the war be interpreted in the light of the Communists' postwar detention of 50,000 to 100,000 former supporters of the Saigon regime in ''re-education'' camps, the corruption and economic mismanagement by Communist officials, the invasion of Cambodia, the persecution of Vietnam's large Chinese ethnic minority and the flight of the boat people?  David W.P. Elliott, an assistant professor of political science at Pomona College in California, believes that Vietnam's postwar record is irrelevant to understanding the war. ''We shouldn't commit the historicist fallacy of reading the present into the past,'' says Mr.  Elliott. ''In 1975, the people wanted peace.'' Like many of the new scholars, Mr. Elliott's interest in Vietnam goes back to the 1960's.  He learned Vietnamese in the Army and later did research on the Vietcong for the Rand Corporation, a private research organization working mostly for the Defense Department.  One of the few Vietnamese now teaching in the United States, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, an assistant professor of history at Harvard, agrees that the Communists' postwar failures ''do not vindicate America's crusade in Vietnam.'' For a part of Vietnam's troubles today were caused by the dislocations of the war. But Mrs. Tai, who came to the United States as a student at Brandeis, maintains that what has happened since 1975 offers an important perspective.  ''During the war,'' she says, ''people looked at the Communists and said they were dedicated, driven and omnicompetent. Now we see them as corrupt and incompetent.'' Did the Communists change so much after 1975 or were Americans grossly mistaken in their earlier impressions?  Mrs. Tai believes that many Americans allowed their political passions to cloud their intellect. At the time of the war, she says, ''it was fashionable to think that a guerrilla movement needed popular support to succeed, and that if the Vietcong survived, therefore they must have popular support.'' But that, Mrs. Tai contends, was a fallacious argument. ''You can see how wrong it was now, because the Communists certainly aren't popular in the South.'' Or, she suggests, look at Cambodia. ''Pol Pot came to power as a guerrilla, but looking at what he did to his country, you'd think twice before saying he was popular.''  Mrs. Tai herself cannot be accused of being an inveterate anti-Communist. Her father was a founder of the Trotskyite party in Vietnam; an aunt was a senior official in the Vietcong's Provisional Revolutionary Government. But she has long had reservations about those antiwar protesters who were too ready to turn the Vietnamese Communists into paragons of virtue and who refused to accept a view of the war that was not black and white.  At Brandeis, she remembers, a professor asked her in class what the Vietnamese thought of the war. When she said that it was a difficult question to answer, since the view of an intellectual was probably very different from that of a peasant, the professor became angry. ''Later,'' she says, ''a student told me that my views didn't count because I was a bourgeois. I said, 'I'm sorry; I'm a human being. There are several hundred thousand members of the middle class in Vietnam.' ''  This kind of academic narrow-mindedness, in Mrs. Tai's view, contributed to American misunderstanding of Vietnam just as much as ignorance in the White House and the State Department.  Until quite recently, Vietnam has been a giant black hole in American academia. A survey byin 1970 found that there was no scholar in the United States who devoted most of his or her time to studying North Vietnam; there was no American university with a tenured professorship in Vietnamese studies, and there were fewer than 30 students in the country studying the Vietnamese language. By comparison, there were three times that many studying Thai. According to the Social Science Research Council in New York, from 1951 to 1981 a total of 820 Americans applied to it for financial aid to work on Ph.D. dissertations in Southeast Asia. Of these, only 33 were for Vietnam, almost the same number as for Burma.  John K. Fairbank, professor emeritus of history at Harvard and the man generally recognized as the founder of modern Chinese studies in the United States, refers to this lack of expertise on Vietnam as an academic Pearl Harbor. One reason for this blind spot, he suggests, was that the French excluded American missionaries and businessmen from Vietnam, and Americans therefore did not have a personal stake in Vietnam.  However, by the time the United States became militarily involved, many academics considered the war so immoral that dispassionate analysis of the conflict became almost impossible. Only a handful of scholars actually went to Vietnam to do research there.  One of them was Samuel L. Popkin, now an associate professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego. After he spent time in 1966 conducting interviews in Vietnamese villages, he was treated as a pariah when he returned to Harvard, where he was then an assistant professor.  His problem: He had returned from Vietnam with a complex view. He did not approve of the way the Americans were fighting the war - ''this crazy chasing around in the villages with our massive firepower looking for body counts'' - but he did not find that the Communists were the popular good guys of American antiwar mythology.  Mr. Popkin's friends in Cambridge didn't want to hear about this.  He got back in his colleagues' good graces only after he was jailed in 1972 for refusing to testify before a special grand jury set up by the White House to find out who leaked the Pentagon Papers - the Pentagon's massive top-secret study of American involvement in Indochina from World War II to May 1968 - to The New York Times.  Douglas Pike, who throughout the war years was the resident expert in the United States Embassy in Saigon on the Vietnamese Communists, remembers a similar encounter with academic close-mindedness when he was on leave in Cambridge, Mass., in 1964 to write a book about the Vietcong. He had been invited to take part in an antiwar teach-in and found himself debating with a professor from the Harvard Dental School. ''The professor really didn't have his facts straight, so I asked him if he had ever been to Vietnam,'' Mr. Pike recalls.  '' 'No, that's not necessary,' the professor replied.  ''So I said, 'I've never been to dental school, but suppose I give you a root canal.' '' 'That's different,' he said.  ''I replied, 'How at Harvard, of all places, can you say knowledge is not important?' '' Mr. Pike has now retired from the Government and is the first director of the Indochina studies program at the University of California at Berkeley -an appointment that would have been unthinkable a decade ago at a campus that was in the vanguard of the antiwar movement. Mr. Pike has just completed a book on the North Vietnamese Army, which he wrote after discovering to his amazement that there was no comparable study. ''We never even knew the names of North Vietnam's generals or what their strategic thinking was,'' he says. ''It shows how ignorant and arrogant we were. We just assumed we would win.'' Mr. Pike's presence at Berkeley, where he is setting up a two-million-page archive on Indochina, is testament to Vietnam's having quietly made the transition from controversial public issue to history. as victory by the Communists inevitable? Since the end of the war, some of the best new scholarship has focused on the origins of the Communist movement in Vietnam and its reasons for success.  According to one school of thought, the Communists' early capture of the nationalist issue made their eventual victory a foregone conclusion. David G. Marr - a visiting professor at Cornell last fall who is now teaching at the Australian National University in Canberra - has shown how the Communists under Ho Chi Minh were able to build their strength in the 1930's and 40's by appealing to the centuriesold tradition of Vietnamese nationalism. Mr. Marr's two books, ''Vietnamese Anti-Colonialism, 1885-1925'' (1971) and ''Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945'' (1981), are widely regarded as models of scholarly research.  In his view, ''the most important development of the entire conflict was the August 1945 revolution,'' when the Vietminh (the Communist-led guerrillas who had fought against the French) under Ho Chi Minh seized Hanoi and proclaimed an independent Vietnam before the French could re-establish their presence at the end of World War II.  ''Everything done after that by the French and the Americans was an attempt to turn back the clock, but they couldn't succeed,'' adds Mr. Marr, a former leading antiwar activist who is one of the few professors with military experience in Vietnam; he learned Vietnamese in the Marines. ''The outcome was predetermined. For the Communists were able to gain and hold legitimacy as a patriotic front.''  Says Professor Elliott of Pomona College, ''In 1945, the Vietminh clearly had overwhelming popular support - even the United States at first recognized this'' (an O.S.S. team had worked with Ho at the time). ''The Vietminh,'' he continues, ''won the war again in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu, and the Communists won it a third time in early 1965, before Johnson's commitment of U.S. ground forces.''  Mr. Popkin, among others, disagrees with this kind of deterministic interpretation. ''It's anti-intellectual; it doesn't allow for the normal process of change which occurs in history,'' he counters. ''If you argue that the Communists should have won the war in 1975 because they were the most popular group in 1945, does that mean that we should have a Democratic President today because Roosevelt was elected in 1944?'' Mr. Popkin himself is a liberal Democrat.  A very different view of the relations between Peking and Hanoi is also emerging. Early in the war, some Administration officials, like then Secretary of State Dean Rusk, contended that American commitment was necessary because North Vietnam was acting as an agent of Chinese Communist aggression. But if American diplomacy was able to salvage anything of value from the war, it was improved relations with China. The split between Hanoi and Peking grew out of centuries of enmity between the two countries and China's growing concern that the Vietnamese Communists were aligning themselves with the Soviet Union, China's erstwhile ally.  The break between North Vietnam and China has produced intriguing new evidence about another long-disputed topic: Who was responsible for failing to hold the 1956 elections, which, under the terms of the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the French Indochina war, would have reunified North and South Vietnam?  In the past, many liberal antiwar critics blamed the Eisenhower Administration for encouraging President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam to ignore the elections. They argued that it was only because of the provision for the elections that Ho Chi Minh had agreed to the temporary division of Vietnam at Geneva, and that when the elections were not held, the Communists had little choice but to resume the war. But Vietnam's leaders now claim that the Chinese actually cut off military aid to them in 1954 to compel them to negotiate with the French and accept the division of the country. Pham Van Dong, Vietnam's Prime Minister, told Mr. Karnow that he had said at the time: ''The Chinese have betrayed us.'' And several scholars have found records indicating that Zhou Enlai, China's Prime Minister, expected the separation of Vietnam to be long lasting and turned down Ho's request in 1956 for help in arranging the elections. This does not exonerate Washington for its role in discouraging the elections, says Professor Tai, but it shows that the United States was not alone.  Disclosures from Hanoi since 1975 are also making possible a reexamination of the Vietcong's growth. During the war, the most influential academic account of the origins of the National Liberation Front (N.L.F.), the formal name for the Vietcong, was in a book by two Cornell professors, George McT. Kahin and John W. Lewis, ''The United States in Vietnam.'' The authors argued forcefully that the Vietcong was ''Southern rooted.''  After the Geneva settlement, the authors contended, the Communists withdrew all their armed troops to the newly created North Vietnam, leaving behind only political cadres. Hanoi favored only political, not armed, resistance to Ngo Dinh Diem. But given the ''harshness and heavy-handedness of Diem's Government'' these Southerners ''lost patience with the Communist North'' and organized an insurgency led by the N.L.F. ''Hanoi, despite its reluctance, was then obliged to sanction the Southerners' actions.''  Professors Kahin and Lewis also asserted that there was no evidence that Hanoi encouraged ''militant tactics by the Southerners'' until as late as September 1960, or, contrary to United States Government claims, that Hanoi directed the formation of the N.L.F., which was a broad united front of Communist and non-Communist organizations.  Scholars still agree that most of the early Vietcong were Southerners and that there were factional disputes in Hanoi over how to pursue the insurgency during the 1950's. But a history published by the People's Army of Vietnam in 1980, titled ''The Anti-U.S.  Resistance War for National Salvation, 1954-1975: Military Events,'' contends that Hanoi played a large role in the development of the Vietcong. The history records, for example, that as early as 1957 ''cadres and men who remained behind'' in the South were able to form ''37 armed companies.''  Moreover, the history also admits that in a secret directive by the North Vietnamese Politburo in May 1959, Hanoi ordered its Southern supporters to switch from political action to armed struggle. To provide help for the new fighting, Hanoi established a special task force, code named Group 559, which set up infiltration routes and moved ''people, weapons and supplies'' through Laos into South Vietnam.  When the N.L.F. was proclaimed in December 1960, this official Communist history goes on, it was done at the order of the party in Hanoi, and the Front's program ''followed the line delineated by our party.'' These actions marked a critical turning point in the war, leading to the formation of bigger Vietcong units and an increase in attacks on South Vietnamese Government posts. It was this stepped-up activity that confronted President Kennedy when he took office in 1961 and led him to increase the number of American advisers in South Vietnam.  On another critical question, too, the Communists have been more candid since the end of the war: When did they begin sending regular North Vietnamese troops into the South?  Washington had long maintained that Hanoi started infiltrating its regular army units in the fall of 1964, prompting President Johnson's decision to begin bombing North Vietnam and then to dispatch American ground forces to South Vietnam a few months later.  Hanoi denied it had troops in the South until virtually the end of the war. When I visited North Vietnam in 1969, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said with a straight face that there were no Northern troops in the South. And antiwar activists dismissed State Department white papers on Northern infiltration. But when Mr. Karnow interviewed officials in Hanoi in 1981, they talked about enlarging the Ho Chi Minh Trail as early as 1964.  All this leads to another question raised by the new scholarship: Were Americans, grown suspicious of their own Government, too eager to accept as truth whatever the Vietnamese Communists said?  Throughout the war, there was heated debate over the degree of autonomy the N.L.F. enjoyed. Was it merely a puppet of North Vietnam, as many American officials insisted, or was it an independent organization, as the Communists claimed? The argument was important, because if the N.L.F. was independent, there might had been a chance for a negotiated settlement in the South.  Harrison E. Salisbury, who was among the first correspondents allowed to visit Hanoi in late 1966, made a strong case for the independence of the N.L.F. in his book ''Behind the Lines - Hanoi.'' The N.L.F., Mr. Salisbury wrote, ''had a government. It had a cabinet ... its own troops, its own generals, its own petty officials ... .''  From talks with an N.L.F. official in Hanoi, Mr. Salisbury said, he learned that the Front got its weapons directly from the Soviet Union and China and did not ''utilize Hanoi as a middleman.'' ''All military decisions in the South were the responsibility of the South.'' When Mr. Salisbury quizzed Prime Minister Dong on what would happen when the war was over, the Prime Minister assured him that the North would not annex the South: ''Reunification would only be by mutual agreement.'' Mr. Salisbury came away convinced that American officials who derided the N.L.F. were missing ''genuine possibilities'' for peace.  Asked recently if he might have been misled by the Communists, Mr.  Salisbury said, ''I'll stand by my reporting of the time.'' But, he added, he had been in Hanoi in early 1967 and ''by the time the war finally ended the situation was so vastly different that whatever had been said by myself, or Hanoi, or L.B.J. or anybody in the N.L.F.  really had very little validity.''  Since the war, some members of the N.L.F. have contended they themselves had been deceived by Hanoi. Writing last fall in The New York Review of Books, Truong Nhu Tang, the former Minister of Justice in the N.L.F.'s government and a French-educated ''independent socialist,'' indicated that he joined the Vietcong because he believed the Communists' promises that they would work for an autonomous, democratic South. At the end of the war, Hanoi annexed the South and the N.L.F. was disbanded.  At ''the simple farewell dinner'' held to disband the N.L.F. in 1976, Mr. Tang recalled, neither the party nor the Government bothered to send a representative. ''I was tragically wrong'' about the Communists, he wrote. ''The North Vietnamese Communists, survivors of protracted, blood-drenched campaigns against colonialism, interventionism and human oppression, became in their turn colonialists, interventionists and architects of one of the world's most rigid re-gimes.'' For the first time in Vietnam's history, Mr. Tang went on, people risked their lives to flee the country -something they had not done under the French or the Americans. Mr. Tang himself escaped by boat in 1979 and now lives in Paris.  American antiwar writers had envisioned a far happier future for Vietnam. One such writer was Frances FitzGerald, who wrote ''Fire in the Lake,'' a book that was both the most widely read and most highly acclaimed volume to come out of the war. (It won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award and the Bancroft Prize in history in 1973.) In the lyrical closing passage, Miss FitzGerald prophesied: ''Pressure is building towards one of those sudden historical shifts when 'individualism' and its attendant corruption gives way to the discipline of the revolutionary community. When this shift takes place ... it will simply mean that the moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.''  ''Fire in the Lake'' had its critics from the start. Mr. Marr, the authority on Vietnamese nationalism, pointed out in a scholarly review at the time of the book's publication that Miss FitzGerald did not know Vietnamese and charged that her depiction of Vietnamese national character was ''little short of disastrous.'' Mr. Popkin at San Diego suspects she was ''swept away by a love affair with the N.L.F.'' and that her belief that the Vietnamese would be happier under the Communists was ''racist and condescending.''  Miss FitzGerald rejects the charge that she was too romantic about the Communists. ''I'd stick with it,'' she says. ''I think it's written in a rather romantic style; one chooses rhetorical modes to make people understand certain things.'' As for Vietnam's terrible postwar troubles, she insists they are the result of the damage caused by the war, though she concedes the Communists have proved inept at running the economy.  What went wrong on the American side? Today, the one common note sounded by virtually all scholars is the need to start searching for the answer with President Truman's decision in 1945 to reverse Washington's earlier support for Ho Chi Minh. It was a choice made out of concern for bolstering France in Europe against the looming Soviet menace.  ''In class,'' says Robert A. Scalapino, director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California at Berkeley, ''I always stress that the history of American involvement in Vietnam was a series of decisions which cumulatively narrowed the choices for each succeeding President. No President was able to begin afresh with Vietnam.''  Professor Scalapino had a reputation as a conservative during the war, but Professor George Kahin, who was an outspoken critic of the war, and was until recently director of Cornell's Southeast Asia program, shares his view. In a new study of American involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967 -which he says is based on trips to Vietnam in the 60's and extensive original research in Government files - Professor Kahin claims he will prove that Washington actually began giving secret military aid to the French for Vietnam in the late 1940's.  ''This aid was officially shown in the records as going to Europe, but it was subverted to Vietnam by the French with U.S.  understanding,'' says Professor Kahin. Most history books date the origin of American involvement in Vietnam from a decision by President Truman's National Security Council in 1950 to provide military aid for the French war in Indochina.  Another key turning point whose significance was not appreciated at the time, historians now believe, was the 1963 coup against President Diem. Because the Kennedy Administration sanctioned the coup, Washington became morally and politically responsible for all the regimes that succeeded it, wrote Larry Berman in a new book, ''Planning a Tragedy: The Americanization of the War in Vietnam'' (1982).  Mr. Berman, an associate professor of political science at the University of California at Davis, is one of several writers now offering a more sympathetic portrait of Lyndon Johnson's role in the war. His book focuses on the decision-making process that led up to President Johnson's announcement on July 28, 1965, that he was increasing the number of American troops in Vietnam from 75,000 to 125,000, with additional forces to be deployed as necessary. This move is generally regarded as the critical decision that led to open-ended escalation.  Like a number of the new scholars, Mr. Berman was not trained in Vietnamese studies but is a specialist on the American Presidency.  His book is based on recently declassified White House documents he found while doing other research in the Johnson Library in Austin, Tex.  Nowhere in the documents was there evidence that President Johnson had a plan either for winning the war or for getting out. The reason for the absence of any coherent strategic plan is that President Johnson was trying to save his Great Society, not Vietnam. By an accident of history, in July 1965 both Medicare and the Civil Rights Act of 1965 were at crucial stages in Congressional committees; the Model Cities Act and the Higher Education Act were soon to follow. Lyndon Johnson was caught in a dilemma.  ''He didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them,'' Mr. Berman wrote. ''He really wanted to be the next face on Mount Rushmore.'' But the Communists were close to victory in Vietnam in early 1965, and President Johnson could not leave himself open to a charge by conservatives that he lost the war. On the other hand, if he took the steps the Pentagon urged - mobilizing the Reserves, for instance - Congressional liberals might have retaliated by withdrawing support for his Great Society programs.  ''So Johnson chose a middle course, to fight the war at the lowest possible cost, on the cheap,'' Mr. Berman went on. ''And he lied about what he was doing. He staged a debate to create a war climate, so that when he announced the number of troops was only going up from 75,000 to 125,000, he looked like a moderate. But he knew there would be 300,000 troops in Vietnam in 1966.''  ''We get a tragic historical figure who had to choose between guns and butter and couldn't,'' Mr. Berman continued. ''In the end, he neither settled the war nor got his Great Society, since as he fought in Vietnam, it drained the money needed for his domestic programs.''  Mr. Berman's thesis is similar to that in a book widely regarded by scholars as a seminal study of America's role in Vietnam - ''The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked'' (1979), by Leslie H. Gelb, now a correspondent for The New York Times, and Richard K. Betts, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. For this work, the authors drew heavily on the Pentagon Papers, which provided critical new groundwork for analyzing Washington's decision-making process.  Mr. Gelb himself was director of the Pentagon Papers project within the Defense Department.  Mr. Gelb and Mr. Betts challenge the old liberal view put forward in books, such as David Halberstam's best seller ''The Best and the Brightest,'' that the United States stumbled into a quagmire in Vietnam through hubris and miscalculation.  Instead, they argue, Washington's planning machinery worked well, providing facts and options for the President. Rarely were the policy makers deluded that the odds for success in Vietnam were high. The trouble was that the Presidents, from Harry Truman to Richard Nixon, were afraid both to risk losing Vietnam to the Communists and to accept the decisive recommendations of their military advisers, which could lead to war with China or a domestic backlash. So they chose the in-between option, doing only what was necessary to stave off a Communist takeover at the time. This prevented a Communist victory till 1975. But their policies of gradual escalation played into the hands of the North Vietnamese, whose strategy was to drag out the war and make it increasingly costly to the United States.  In effect, the Presidents chose to ''nibble the bullet rather than bite it,'' Mr. Betts said at a conference on ''The U.S. Experience in Vietnam'' held last month at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.  Another factor in Washington's decision making, scholars now say, was that in the 1960's American political scientists were fascinated by theories of how the United States could effectively fight limited wars, as opposed to all-out conventional or nuclear wars. Theorists explored the question of how a nation could use force or the threat of force to compel its adversary to back down. Implicit in their theories was the idea that it was possible to signal your opponent by gradually increasing threats.  In another new study, ''When Governments Collide: Coercion and Diplomacy in the Vietnam Conflict, 1964-1968'' (1980), Wallace J.  Thies has shown how President Johnson and his advisers believed they could ''fine-tune'' the bombing and their peace offers to ''signal'' Hanoi to abandon its support for the Vietcong. But President Johnson's program suffered from two serious flaws, argues Mr. Thies, a professor of political science at Berkeley.  First of all, in a bureaucracy as large as the American Government, it proved impossible to ''orchestrate'' our bombing and diplomacy.  For example, the selection and timing of bombing targets often depended on extraneous factors like the weather; coordination between the Air Force and diplomats was difficult. As a result, what Washington intended to be a show of firmness often appeared to Hanoi to be vacillation or weakness.  Second, Mr. Thies contends, Washington had little understanding of politics in Hanoi and did not realize that the dominant group in the leadership, headed by Le Duan, the party First Secretary, had staked their careers on victory in the South after prolonged factional debate. By 1965, these men had already worked at infiltration and organizing the war in the South for many years. Like their American counterparts, they could not afford to be charged with losing South Vietnam.  Compared with the numerous new studies on the origins of American involvement in Vietnam, there has been little written on the war after 1966, and especially after the Tet offensive in 1968, largely because of the unavailability of materials. At the Johnson Library, relatively few documents have been declassified for the period after 1965, and given Federal budget cutbacks and the Reagan Administration's tightened procedures for declassification, library officials say further progress will be slow.  The situation is even worse for the Nixon years. There is no equivalent of the Pentagon Papers for Mr. Nixon's Presidency and there is no Nixon Presidential library yet. So scholars are heavily dependent on the memoirs of Mr. Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  One of the best accounts, however, has been pieced together by George C. Herring, a professor of American history at the University of Kentucky and author of ''America's Longest War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975'' (1979). Mr. Herring believes that President Nixon, like his predecessors, early on rejected calls for withdrawal - which he saw as dishonorable - and appeals for sharply increased escalation, feeling that he could solve a riddle that had baffled earlier Presidents.  Mr. Nixon's eventual strategy - Vietnamization -emerged on an improvised basis without a thorough policy review, Mr. Herring contends. In a paper written for the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, Mr. Herring charged that during the first year of his Administration Mr. Nixon's policy may have been ''a classic case of the President appeasing various bureaucratic constituencies by giving them a bit of what they wanted.'' The military got to bomb North Vietnam's sanctuaries in Cambodia; Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird got a speeded-up pull-out of American troops from Vietnam to appease American opinion (with Vietnamization, the war was turned over to the South Vietnamese Army - ARVN -which was given new training and improved weapons) and the State Department got negotiations with Hanoi. But Mr. Herring concludes that President Nixon's plan did not provide either enough force to compel North Vietnam to negotiate or sufficient concessions to entice Hanoi to the table. Like the improvised strategies of the Johnson era, ''it offered only extended stalemate.''  That there could be a negotiated end to the fighting was, throughout the war, one of the most consistent beliefs of both policy makers in Washington and their critics. But Allan E. Goodman, a professor at Georgetown University, believes this was naive. In another of the new books, ''The Lost Peace: America's Search for a Negotiated Settlement of the Vietnam War'' (1978), he argues that ''The real obstacle to a negotiated settlement was probably not Washington's diplomacy,'' but ''as Hanoi maintained ever since its first direct conversation with Washington in 1962, the liberation of South Vietnam was an absolutely indispensable prerequisite'' for a settlement.  In other words, North Vietnam was not prepared to compromise.  Hanoi was further encouraged when American spokesmen assured it that American bombing of North Vietnam was not intended to destroy the country. The North Vietnamese were aware that the longer the war went on the more painful it was for the United States. So Hanoi waited for Washington to make the concessions.  In the end, this was what happened. ''Nearly every time Washington made a negotiating offer to Hanoi, the U.S. terms softened,'' Mr.  Goodman wrote, until finally, in the Paris talks in 1972, Mr.  Kissinger agreed that the United States would withdraw from Vietnam without obtaining a comparable pledge from Hanoi.  Without access to more documents from the period, it is impossible to judge if President Nixon and Mr. Kissinger believed the Paris accords gave South Vietnam a real chance to survive or whether they felt the agreement was merely a face-saving ''decent interval'' during which the United States could disentangle itself from Vietnam. Either way, America's exit from Vietnam proved as stumbling as its entry.  A conundrum that has baffled a generation of American military officers is this: The Army won every battle it fought against the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese, inflicting terrible losses on them. Yet Hanoi emerged the victor. When Col. Harry G. Summers Jr.  was in Hanoi in 1975 as part of the American military delegation overseeing the Peace Accords, he mentioned to a North Vietnamese officer that the Communists had never defeated the Americans on the battlefield. The North Vietnamese colonel replied: ''That may be so, but it is also irrelevant.''  In the years since, Colonel Summers, an instructor at the Army War College at Carlisle, Pa., has found that, despite the welter of writing about Vietnam, few scholars have re-examined the military side of the war. To try to fill this void, Colonel Summers, who fought in Korea and served two tours in Vietnam, has turned out one of the most thoughtful and provocative military studies of the war, titled ''On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War'' (1982).  Unlike some senior American commanders, Colonel Summers does not blame the politicians, the protesters or the press for America's defeat. Instead, he finds flaws in the military's own approach. Most important, the Army simply lacked a strategy - an unforgivable sin for a soldier.  Instead of having a strategy, Colonel Summers argues, military and policy planners got carried away by the mystique of fighting a counterinsurgency war. In Colonel Summers's view, North Vietnam was the real opponent, but because Hanoi hid its involvement behind a smokescreen of guerrillas, the United States got tied down in fighting those insurgents. ''We were like a bull charging the toreador's cape,'' he comments.  The result was that the Army got caught up in General Westmoreland's search-and-destroy operations, which cost the lives of many American soldiers, outraged public opinion and did not deal with the real source of Communist strength - North Vietnam. Because of their helicopters and firepower, American forces may have had the tactical initiative, but they confused that with the strategic initiative, which Hanoi had all along.  Operating from their sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia, the Communists controlled the tempo of the fighting, and no matter how many Communists the Americans killed, success depended on the number of men Hanoi started down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In this war of attrition, North Vietnam could not be beaten as long as it was willing to pay the price.  Where most critics of American military policy in Vietnam have argued that the United States tried to fight a guerrilla war using conventional tactics, Colonel Summers contends - in one of his most controversial points -that it had always been a conventional war. The French in Indochina fought against a guerrilla army, he admits, but Hanoi's use of the Vietcong as proxies obfuscated the issue.  The United States could have had a strategy, Colonel Summers maintains. Since our goal was much the same as it had been in Korea, he believes, to stop the expansion of a Communist state, we could have pursued a Korean solution - cutting off North Vietnam from the South.  Quoting a plan first advanced by retired Gen. Bruce Palmer Jr., a former deputy commander of the American Army in Vietnam, Colonel Summers suggests that, with an expanded naval blockade, the army should have driven across the Demilitarized Zone between the two Vietnams and then cut through Laos to the Thai border, setting up defensive positions.  ''This would have had a number of advantages,'' says Colonel Summers. It would have required far fewer American troops. We could have fought on the defensive, making maximum use of our best asset, our firepower, and reducing our casualties. And it would have left rooting out the guerrillas to the South Vietnamese Army, which was best equipped to do it, and would have kept Americans out of the villages.  Colonel Summers rejects the argument that this strategy would have violated the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia, which he thinks was a fiction. ''The North Vietnamese never made a secret they were fighting an Indochina war,'' he says, and, in fact, the new North Vietnamese history of the war admits that Hanoi had ''volunteers'' in Laos as early as 1959. ''Neutrality was a myth we inflicted on ourselves,'' says Colonel Summers. He also quotes from the Hague Convention of 1907: ''A neutral country has the obligation not to allow its territory to be used by a belligerent. If the neutral country is unwilling or unable to prevent this, the other belligerent has the right to take appropriate counteraction.''  Colonel Summers also contends that the generals should have insisted that President Johnson get a Congressional declaration of war before committing American troops to Vietnam. President Johnson's attempt to fight the war on the cheap, without telling the public about its real costs, led to the credibility gap and helped spread the antiwar movement.  It was this lack of popular support for the war which also fostered the idea that the Vietnam War was more immoral than other wars, Colonel Summers believes. ''People talk about the picture of the little girl running down the road who got napalmed,'' he says. ''But tens of thousands of little girls got incinerated in the fire-bomb raids on Dresden and Tokyo in World War II and we don't remember. The difference is we believed World War II was legitimate.''  To underscore this point, Colonel Summers quotes from an article by General Weyand, the last American commander in Vietnam: ''As military professionals we must speak out, we must counsel our political leaders and alert the American public that there is no such thing as a 'splendid little war.' ... War is death and destruction. The American way of war is particularly violent, deadly and dreadful. We believe in using 'things' - artillery, bombs, massive firepower -in order to conserve our soldiers' lives. ... The Army must make the price of involvement clear before we get involved, so that America can weigh the probable costs of involvement against the dangers of noninvolvement. For there are worse things than war.''  Like a number of officers, Colonel Summers raises the question of why some members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not resign in protest when they sensed the lack of a coherent strategy and President Johnson's attempt to fight the war with limited means.  At the recent conference on Vietnam in Washington, retired Brig.  Gen. Edwin H. Simmons, the director of Marine Corps History and Museums, said that he had asked some of the Chiefs the question himself. ''The inevitable answer is: They could work better from within,'' said General Simmons, who served two tours in Vietnam with the Marines. It was one of the distortions of the Vietnam War, he said, that some officers allowed the honored principle of civilian control of the military to come to mean civilian leadership and management of the military on the combat level in the field. Officers at all levels of command ''used civilian control as an exoneration from moral responsibility,'' he charged.  General Simmons is currently supervising a 10-volume official history of the Marines in Vietnam, one of a series of such projects by each of the armed services. Taken together, they consti-tute the most ambitious and detailed work now being done on the war. The largest in scope is a planned 20-volume series by the Army's Center of Military History in Washington.  The Army's earlier 80-volume history of World War II has received high marks from scholars for its integrity. But Vincent H. Demma -one of 10 historians selected to help write the Vietnam volumes and who has been working on the project since the mid-1960's - admits that victory is easier to record than defeat. Moreover, the writers face another problem, a wealth of documentation left over from a conflict that was not only the first television war, but also the first Xerox and computer war. In Suitland, Md., outside Washington, in a warehouse the size of three football fields, repose more than 60,000 cubic feet of records shipped home by the Army, mostly uncatalogued.  Mr. Demma hopes this material and other archives, including taperecorded interviews with officers as they left Vietnam, will someday furnish what is now missing - ''an understanding of the war from the foxhole up rather than from the policy makers down.'' Aside from some novels by ex-soldiers, very little has been written on the actual conduct of the war, says Mr. Demma. But he feels that the special access he and his fellow authors have to still-classified material, including that in the Presidential libraries and other Government organizations like the Central Intelligence Agency, should eventually provide a more accurate picture of Vietnam.  Despite all the blunders, a number of historians and military specialists are coming to conclude that the American military effort in Vietnam was more successful than was recognized at the time. When Mr. Popkin, for instance, returned to Vietnam in 1969 and 1970 to check on the villages he had studied in 1966, he was surprised to find that the balance of power in the countryside had shifted dramatically in the South Vietnamese Government's favor. This was, in part, the result of the huge Communist mistake in the 1968 Tet offensive, when the best Vietcong units, which had long preserved their strength by operating clandestinely, exposed themselves in open attacks. They were decimated by American and South Vietnamese counterat-tacks. American officials estimated the Communists lost 40,000 killed in the Tet fighting, the bulk of them Southern guerrillas rather than North Vietnamese.  Mr. Tang, the former N.L.F. Minister of Justice, has described Tet as ''catastrophic''; he calculated the Vietcong lost half their forces and new recruits could not be found lo-cally to replace them.  As a result, by the early 70's, 90 percent of the fighting was being done by North Vietnamese troops and the war turned more and more into a conventional conflict between North and South. (Mr. Pike and some other specialists have speculated that Hanoi may have deliberately allowed the Vietcong to be massacred at Tet to assure North Vietnam's control over the Communist movement in the South, much as the advancing Russian Army stood by during the Warsaw uprising in 1944.)  But at the time, most Americans, shocked by the daring Vietcong attack on the United States Embassy in Saigon and the weeks of street fighting in Hue, felt Tet was a defeat for the United States. It led to President Johnson's announcement that he would not run again, his proclamation of a bombing halt over North Vietnam and his decision to stop the escalation of American ground forces. For most Americans, Tet was the beginning of the end of our involvement.  Even those American officials and journalists who claimed in 1968 that Tet was a military defeat for the Communists still tended to credit Hanoi with a masterful strategy -sacrificing troops to deal Washington a psychological blow. But that view, too, was wrong.  When he was in Vietnam for his television series, Mr. Karnow interviewed Tran Do, one of the Communist generals in charge of the Tet attacks. The general denied that Tet was designed to have a political impact in the United States; instead, he said, the Communists fully believed there would be popular uprisings and that they could ''annihilate the U.S. and Saigon troops.'' The political impact ''was an accidental byproduct,'' the general said. Major popular uprisings never took place.  Tet, in fact, ''totally destroyed the idea of the inevitability of an N.L.F. victory in the villages,'' says Mr. Popkin. ''When the villagers saw the stacks of Vietcong bodies in Saigon on their local TV sets, they rushed to get their sons into local defense forces'' so that they would not be drafted by the Vietcong.  At the same time, the sheer weight of American military spending and aid programs began to be felt. Many peasants rushed to work for the Americans, building roads, bridges, runways and schools.  Typically, Mr. Popkin found, in the 18 villages he studied, the peasants used their earnings to buy a baby piglet, raised it, sold it, and with the profits invested in a diesel water pump to irrigate their rice fields. With these mechanized pumps the farmers in the Mekong Delta could at last get two rice crops a year, and the standard of living in the countryside started to take off.  In the early and mid-1960's, the peasants had had an economic incentive to live in a ''liberated'' or Communist village, Mr.  Popkin found, because the Vietcong taxes were lower than the rent peasants had to pay landlords in Government-held areas. But by the time of Tet, the incentive was reversed. As the Vietcong's military situation grew more desperate, their taxes increased. And now that the peasants had pigs, chickens and rice they could sell in Government markets, they got angry when the Communists cut a road.  ''The Vietcong may have been more honest than the Government, but they couldn't compete with water pumps, chemical fertilizer and Hondas,'' says Mr. Popkin. He has developed some of his ideas about the farmers' material interests in a book widely used in college courses, titled ''The Rational Peasant: The Political Economy of Rural Society in Vietnam'' (1979).  In the light of Hanoi's postwar revelations, specialists are revising even their views of the Phoenix program, the scheme sponsored by the C.I.A. to destroy the Vietcong apparatus in the villages by arresting or killing local Communist cadres. ''The conven tional liberal wisdom at the time was that it was a terrible thing,'' says Mr. Karnow. ''It killed people indiscriminately and was subject to corruption by the South Vietnamese who turned in people for the reward money. But the people I talked to on my trip in Vietnam said it had wiped out many Southern cadres and helped cripple the N.L.F.''  Overall, by 1970 nearly 90 percent of the countryside was officially ''pacified,'' compared with only 33 percent in 1965, a crude though significant index of change.  Professor Herring at the University of Kentucky has suggested that ''the ultimate irony'' of the war may be that the American position in South Vietnam was stronger at the end of 1972, just before the Paris peace agreement, than at any previous point in the war. Mr.  Popkin concurs and adds, ''There's no doubt that if Nixon had kept up U.S. aid after 1973, South Vietnam might have survived.'' But that is one of the great historical ifs. American patience had run out.  What, then, went wrong after the Paris accords? Why did South Vietnam collapse in 1975 under a North Vietnamese attack that was designed only to prepare for a bigger, final offensive in 1976?  (According to Douglas Pike, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the North Vietnamese commander, was so startled by the rapidity of the South Vietnamese retreat that he cautioned his officers in the field by radio against falling into a trap.)  Clearly one problem was the poor leadership and corruption that bedeviled the Saigon Government throughout the war. But Professor Tai believes that in fairness we should recognize that Saigon faced problems Hanoi did not have. North Vietnam could forge a more disciplined state because its society was more homogeneous than that of the South. Most anti-Communists in the North moved to the South in 1954, and the North never had to deal with the South's fractious babble of sects like the Buddhists, the Hoa Hao and the Cao Dai.  Mrs. Tai also believes that the American peace movement misunderstood how the South Vietnamese people felt. ''There were many people like me who did not support Thieu but who didn't like the Communists either,'' she says. Indeed, she represented the kind of third force that American officials in Saigon hoped would somehow emerge. ''I didn't think a Communist victory would lead to any improvement for the middle class, or even for the peasants, in whose name the revolution was fought,'' she says. In 1977, her father, despite his Communist background, was arrested for protesting the human-rights situation in Vietnam; he died of starvation in a ''reeducation'' camp in 1981.  On the basis of his village interviews, Mr. Popkin also came to a conclusion that the American left overrated the popularity of the Communists. With his training in polling, Mr. Popkin noticed a number of ''unobtrusive indicators.'' ''When you want to know what radio stations people are listening to,'' he says, ''you don't ask them. You just look in their cars at a parking lot to see where the dials are set.''  One sign was that while many South Vietnamese soldiers deserted to go home -just as Union troops did in the American Civil War - they did not defect in large units to the Communists. This was in sharp contrast to China, where during the 1940's whole Nationalist divisions defected to Mao Zedong's Communist guerrillas. Mr. Popkin noted, too, that in the Tet offensive, when the Communists' surprise attacks trapped many Americans in Vietnamese residential areas, very few were betrayed to the Communists.  ''It tells you,'' says Mr. Popkin, ''that the problem in Vietnam was not too much support for the Communists, or lack of support for the Saigon Government. It was just a rotten government. You can't fight something with nothing.''  Another reason for Saigon's collapse in 1975, South Vietnamese and American officials have long insisted, was the cutback in American aid mandated by a Congress which lost interest in the war after the G.I.'s had left in 1973.  American military aid to South Vietnam and Laos dropped from about $2.5 billion in 1973 to $1.6 billion in 1974 and then plunged further to a projected $700 million in 1975, half of it covering shipping costs. When Hanoi's attack came, South Vietnam's armed forces were receiving only 2 percent of the funds and supplies American soldiers had gotten in 1968 or 1969, according to retired Maj. Gen. John E.  Murray, the chief American military administrator in Saigon in 1974.  In other words, said Gen. Van Tien Dung, North Vietnam's field commander, in his memoir on the final offensive, the Thieu regime was compelled ''to fight a poor man's war,'' a fact that Hanoi took carefully into account.  ''You know what Napoleon said,'' General Murray pointed out at the conference on Vietnam in Washington. ''God is on the side of the biggest battalions. And right about then, God was on the side of the Communists. They were bigger, they were stronger. That's why ARVN lost the war.''  But there was something else at work. The huge American investment in Vietnam, Mr. Karnow points out, had ''lulled the South Vietnamese into believing that the United States would never leave. Nobody in his right mind would spend billions to build the complex at Cam Ranh Bay and then depart. The Americans must be crazy. They were crazy.  The South Vietnamese were left holding the bag.''  Professor Elliott at Pomona College thinks this dependence is the key to understanding the war. ''It seems to me,'' he says, ''that the Communists had an appeal that prevented the South Vietnamese from coalescing around a non-Communist government. Because the Saigon regimes were always dependent on the United States, in the eyes of the nationalistic Vietnamese, this created a moral paralysis.'' Mr.  Elliott says he could see this in interviews he conducted with Vietcong defectors in the Mekong Delta during the war. ''However much they had come to dislike the Communists, they acknowledged the Front had a moral appeal which undermined the Government.'' So the South Vietnamese faced an insoluble contradiction. ''They couldn't win without us, but they couldn't win with us either.'' One group whose influence on Vietnam has been downgraded by the new scholars is the antiwar movement. From studying public-opinion polls, John E. Mueller, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester, has found that the Vietnam War was no more unpopular than the Korean War - until American casualties in Vietnam surpassed those in Korea. That line was crossed, coincidentally, during the Tet offensive. Professor Mueller believes that the tactics of some of the protesters, with flag burnings and anti-American slogans, actually undercut their credibility with the public. ''The antiwar movement picked up negative popularity ratings in an almost unprecedented degree,'' he says.  Washington was certainly aware of the protests, says Mr. Mueller, who has written about the subject in ''War, Presidents and Public Opinion'' (1973). But the Johnson Administration's about-faces in 1968 - stopping the bombing of North Vietnam and ending our troop escalation -had more to do with disaffection within the Government itself over how badly the war was going and its high costs, he asserts.  Another little-known reason for the Government's shift in 1968, Mr. Mueller has found, is that within the Government ''the value of saving Vietnam from Communism had gone down since we got committed in 1965.'' China, formerly seen as a threat, had become engulfed in the Cultural Revolution, and Indonesia, which had appeared on the brink of a Communist takeover, massacred its Communist Party.  Mr. Mueller also points out that President Johnson's near defeat by Senator Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, which influenced President Johnson's decision not to run again, was caused more by angry hawks than by doves. At the ballot box, anti-Johnson hawks outnumbered anti-Johnson doves by 3 to 2.  The protesters did have an effect on the Presidential elections.  Their attacks on Vice President Humphrey ''probably gave Nixon the slim margin of votes necessary to win in 1968,'' says Mr. Mueller.  Then, in 1972, with the Democratic convention controlled by opponents of the war, ''they picked George McGovern, arguably the worst choice as a Democratic candidate in modern times.''  But Mr. Mueller discounts the charge by hawks that the protest movement strengthened Hanoi's resolve and helped the United States lose Vietnam. ''Hanoi may have been encouraged by the peace movement,'' he says, ''but the North Vietnamese were fanatics who would have continued the war for as long as necessary to win.'' In another of his studies, Mr. Mueller estimated that the North Vietnamese and Vietcong suffered 500,000 to 600,000 battle deaths - about 2.5 percent to 3 percent of their prewar population. By comparison, the United States lost only three-tenths of 1 percent of its population in battle during World War II, and the Japanese, whom Americans regarded as true fanatics, 1.4 percent. ''The crucial mistake the U.S. made was to underestimate how much punishment North Vietnam would take,'' he says.  Are there lessons Americans can learn from Vietnam? The question is important, because it was one of the supposed lessons of World War II - not to appease aggression - that helped get the United States into Vietnam. There is little consensus, however, on what can be gleaned from Vietnam. James C. Thomson Jr., curator at the Nieman Foundation at Harvard, who was a member of President Johnson's National Security Council staff and who opposed American involvement in Vietnam, has proposed that the ''central lesson'' is that we should never again ''take on the job of trying to defeat a nationalist anticolonial movement under indigenous Communist control in former French Indochina.'' This is, notes Mr. Thomson wryly, ''a lesson of less than universal significance.''  But Robert E. Osgood, a professor of American foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, believes Americans have learned the danger of intervening in a revolutionary war where the local government is weak. In such cases, the United States must commit so many troops to compensate for the regime's shortcomings that it ends up only undermining the government. El Salvador is an example, says Professor Osgood, who was one of the most important theorists on limited war in the 1960's.  ''But this is not necessarily a lesson you can apply in every revolutionary war,'' he adds. In the Philippines after World War II, American aid provided a critical ''missing component'' that stopped a Communist insurgency. So to exclude American intervention in every contingency ''is probably overdrawing the lesson,'' he says.  The problem, in Professor Osgood's view, is that there are many variables for Washington to ponder: the strength of the local regime, the resolve of its adversary, the possibilities for getting out if American intervention proves unsuccessful.  The real issue is the magnitude of American interests and the threat to them. ''That was a mistake in Vietnam -our greatly inflated rhetoric about falling dominoes turned out to be wrong,'' Professor Osgood points out. But American foreign policy is still wedded to containment, and questions may arise again about combating a Communist-led revolution or takeover in the Middle East or Central America, he notes.  If that prospect arises, says Mr. Betts, we have not really learned what to do except that the United States can fight only if the war is kept short. ''We know more now,'' he believes, but we do not know how to avoid a disastrous war except at the possible price that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson foresaw -disastrous acceptance of defeat.  Another lesson is the need for better leadership, says Ernest R.  May, a professor of history at Harvard. At the Washington conference on Vietnam, he recalled that in 1948 George C. Marshall, then Secretary of State, opposed a military proposal to send 10,000 American advisers to aid the Chinese Nationalists because it involved a commitment of uncertain magnitude and indefinite duration. ''What we did not have in 1965 was an individual of Marshall's stature and independent judgment,'' Mr. May said.  There are also lessons for small states that might look to the United States for help. At the Washington meeting, Bui Diem, who served as South Vietnam's Ambassador to the United States, issued a warning. ''My advice to small nations considering U.S. aid is that they should be wary of the United States,'' he said. ''They should pay very close attention to the American domestic political system, because U.S. policies can change quickly. We small nations can end up losing higher stakes than the United States itself because, for the American, you can turn the page and say, 'Well, it is an unhappy chapter for U.S. history.' But that is not the same now for the South Vietnamese.''  And there are lessons for the military. The most important, Colonel Summers believes, is that ''we must relearn that public support is critical to American military strategy.'' To make his point, Colonel Summers quotes from General Weyand, the man who welcomed the P.O.W.'s to Saigon in 1973. ''The American Army really is a people's army in the sense that it belongs to the American people,'' the general said. ''When the American people lose their commitment, it is futile to try to keep the Army committed. In the final analysis, the American Army is not so much an arm of the executive branch as it is an arm of the American people.'' Up at the blackboard, a teaching assistant had chalked in the names to be discussed in the day's lecture at the University of Iowa. There, in large letters, were Robert McNamara, and McGeorge Bundy, and Ngo Dinh Diem and the Green Berets.  Fifteen years ago, when Vietnam first invaded the American campus, they would all have been household words, objects of heated debate and perhaps derision. But to the 300 students in the large classroom, they were like something from an arcane novel, to be carefully copied down.  ''For the students, history begins about 1980,'' says Stephen Vlastos, a professor of history at the University of Iowa who is in charge of the course, ''The Vietnam War in Historical Perspective.'' Indeed, most of them were not even born at the time of the Americansupported coup against President Diem. Katharyn Bine, a freshman from Beaman, Iowa, a farming town of 209 people, was only 1 year old when Lyndon Johnson dispatched the first American ground forces to Vietnam in 1965. Before taking the course, she had heard the name Ho Chi Minh, but she had not known who Diem or McNamara or Bundy was.  Yet Miss Bine and the course at Iowa represent another development - a quiet revival of interest in Vietnam on campus 10 years after the last American troops were withdrawn. More than two dozen colleges this year are offering courses on the war or Vietnamese history, ranging from Harvard to Thomas More College in northern Kentucky.  Almost all the classes have drawn more students than their professors expected.  What are the students learning? It seems to depend on the professor, his own view of Vietnam and the books he assigns. Not surprisingly, a majority of the professors were strongly influenced by the antiwar movement. Mr. Vlastos, for instance, helped organize a demonstration against President Johnson while he was an undergraduate at Princeton in 1966. He is candid about his antiwar sentiments.  ''It's the reason I'm teaching the course,'' he says. ''At the beginning of the course, I told the students I believe the war was a terrible mistake.''  Professor Vlastos is also an example of another heritage of academic feeling about the war. Distaste for the war was so widespread that few academics specialized in Vietnam, and so today most of the new courses on Vietnam are being taught by professors who were trained in subjects like American history or Chinese studies.  Mr. Vlastos got his Ph.D. from Berkeley in Japanese history.  Even more striking, though nearly three million Americans served in Vietnam, very few of the professors teaching about Vietnam were ever there. At a conference last fall on ''Vietnam and the Classroom'' in Kentucky, sponsored by the Kentucky Association of Teachers of History, only one of the 11 speakers and only three of the 75 participating teachers had been in Vietnam.  ''If we were talking about World War II, this room would be full of veterans,'' observed T. Wayne Beasley, a professor at Murray State University in western Kentucky. But, Mr. Beasley complained, ''with Vietnam you people who are teaching about it are the same people who were protesting it as students in the 1960's.''  At the Newark campus of Rutgers University, H. Bruce Franklin is worried about a different problem. Mr. Franklin, a professor of English, says he was distressed when he polled the students in his course, ''America and Vietnam,'' and found the majority believed the United States lost the war because ''we didn't try hard enough.'' ''This illusion has to be dispelled immediately,'' Mr. Franklin adds. So he stresses the damage the United States did to Vietnam, like bombing it between 1964 and 1969 with more than nine times the tonnage of high explosives dropped in the entire Pacific theater during World War II. Mr. Franklin rejects a suggestion that such figures may be misleading because many of the bombs dropped on Vietnam landed in the jungle, not on civilian villages.  Despite the prevalence of antiwar views among most professors, some teachers have begun to incorporate the more complex and dispassionate new scholarship into their curriculum. One of the most imaginative new classes is at the University of Louisville, taught by an unlikely duo: a hawkish former artillery officer in Vietnam, Richard N.  Pfeiffer, and a confirmed antiwar activist with a Ph.D. in East Asian history, Andrea McElderry. Miss McElderry is an associate professor of history; Mr. Pfeiffer is a vice president of an industrial-supply company who teaches in his spare time.  ''The idea of the class is to give the students as many different points of view as we can about the war, because we don't think anyone has solved Vietnam,'' says Miss McElderry. ''We don't let our students say things like 'This side won the war.' ''  To broaden the course, the two teachers invite guest speakers from the Louisville area, including a former Green Beret, a retired Army general, a one-time high official in the Saigon Government, a peacemovement activist and a psychiatrist from a Veterans' Administration hospital who treats troubled veterans.  Miss McElderry feels the unusual chemistry between her and Mr.  Pfeiffer has been beneficial. ''Until I met Richard, I was sure of my views about Vietnam. He has made me rethink them, and I have influenced him, too. I couldn't have taught the course the same way with my Asian specialist colleagues, because all of them were getting 2-S student deferments during Vietnam.'' - F.B.

Under the agreement, the two countries will expand their exchange of goods and cooperation in joint enterprises, the official radio said in a broadcast monitored here.  Soviet economic and technical aid to Vietnam has been substantial in recent years. Major non-Communist nations have denied Hanoi aid because of its 1978 invasion of Cambodia.

"      The United States and the Communist Government of Laos, after years of tense relations, have quietly begun discussions aimed at upgrading their diplomatic missions and gaining closer ties, Administration officials said today.  In recent months, they said, Laos has sent several significant signals to the Reagan Administration that State Department and White House officials view as opening the way to firmer links between Vientiane and Washington. These include welcoming and assisting an American group searching for information on United States servicemen missing in action since the Indochina war, as well as affording American diplomats access to Laotian Government officials for the first time in years.  ''They want to move forward,'' an Administration official said.  Another official remarked, ''They appear more flexible, more sensitive.''  S.I. Hayakawa, the former Republican Senator from California who was chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before he left Congress last year, is scheduled to visit Laos this month in the course of an Asian trip to ''further signal our interest,'' one Administration official said.  Under Hanoi's Dominance  Laos, an impoverished, landlocked nation on the Indochinese peninsula, has remained under the dominance of neighboring Vietnam since the collapse of the South Vietnamese Government in Saigon in April 1975. At that point, the Laotian monarchy was abolished, the coalition Government that sought neutrality collapsed and the Communist Lao People's Democratic Party was established. There are currently about 50,000 Vietnamese soldiers and 36,000 Laotian troops in the country.  United States officials say talks with Laos remain sensitive, largely because of Vietnam's dominance, if not control, over the Laotian Government. The United States has no diplomatic relations with Hanoi, mainly because of Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.  ''We view Vietnam and Laos as different entities despite Vietnam's occupation of Laos and the top leadership being advised very strongly by Vietnam,'' said one official. He noted that the Laotians are culturally, ethnically and linguistically far closer to Thailand and other Asian nations than to Vietnam.  Although the move by Laos to seek better relations with the United States ''has a dynamic of its own,'' the decision probably has the ''blessing'' of the Hanoi Government, said one Administration official involved in the talks. Vietnam's diplomatic isolation because of its occupation of Cambodia, and its heavy reliance on the Soviet Union, are viewed by United States officials as key reasons for Hanoi's efforts to ''reverse the current trend'' and open up Laotian relations with the United States.  Missions May Be Upgraded  According to several officials, the measures under discussion include an upgrading to ambassador status of the diplomatic missions in Washington and Vientiane. Currently, the highest-ranking diplomats in both missions, which are kept to a handful of personnel, are those with charge d'affaires status.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 16 1983 ,11

"      Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia arrived today on an official visit that could be marred by disagreement over his Government's plan to resume aid to Vietnam.  The issue of economic aid to Vietnam is certain to be the most sensitive topic in discussions Mr. Hawke will have with President Reagan and other top Administation officials during his four-day stay.  A State Department official made clear to reporters on the eve of the visit that the United States viewed Mr. Hawke's proposal to resume aid to Hanoi before Vietnamese forces are withdrawn from Cambodia as ''very unhelpful.''  Mr. Hawke's Labor Party, which won Australia's general elections in March, is pledged to resume aid to Vietnam that was suspended when Vietnam took control of much of Cambodia in January 1979.  The State Department official said that during the talks U.S.  officials would ''note that the U.S. opposes sending aid to Vietnam'' as long as Vietnamese forces remain in Cambodia.

"   , Thailand, June 28   A senior Reagan Administration official said today that the United States had information that kept it from ruling out the possibility that some Americans captured during the Vietnam War are still alive.  The official said the Administration ''has information in its possesion that precludes ruling out the possibility that live Americans are being held captive in Indochina.''  The official said more than 200 reports from refugees who claimed to have seen American prisoners in Indochina in recent years could not be dismissed. He said polygraph tests supported many of the refugees' reports.  Because of these reports, the official said, the Reagan Administration decided to increase diplomatic efforts to account for missing Americans and to expand intelligence-collection to try to check the refugees' reports. He said the Administration had asked Congress to increase by 25 percent the number of analysts working on the problem in the Defense Intelligence Agency. He said there were 14 or 15 analysts now.  Shultz Addresses Issue  The issue came up today when Secretary of State George P. Shultz appeared to endorse private efforts to recover dead American servicemen in Indochina, a position contradictory to that of the Administration.  Mr. Shultz, speaking at a news conference at the end of a meeting of Southeast Asian nations, said the American Government was for ''any means that can be effective'' in locating and recovering the 2,494 Americans listed as missing in action. He also refused to rule out Government support for a recovery mission headed by James G. (Bo) Gritz, a former Army Special Forces officer in Vietnam who led a mission into Laos last year that failed.  Mr. Shultz's comments contradicted assertions by the Reagan Administration that it considered such private efforts illegal and damaging to official efforts with the same goal.  Immediately after the news conference, State Department officials traveling with Mr. Shultz said that he had not meant to endorse such private efforts and that the Reagan Administration remained opposed to them. They said Mr. Shultz might have been confused because he was not fully briefed about the issue, was not familiar with Mr. Gritz's history and had apparently misunderstood a question.  When asked whether the United States would support a mission by Mr. Gritz, Mr. Shultz said, ''The answer is very unlikely, but these things would have to looked upon case by case.''  U.S. Sought Asians' Help  Mr. Shultz's remarks grew out of the Administration's effort to make the recovery of American dead in Indochina a major issue at the meeting here of the Foreign Ministers of the five countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines - and their six so-called dialogue partners, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, West Germany and the United States.  In a speech to the five Foreign Ministers today Mr. Shultz asked their help in accounting for the missing. He described the issue as a ''matter of the highest priority for President Reagan and for the American people.''  The official said that in a closed meeting with the Foreign Ministers, Mr. Shultz reported that the United States had information indicating that 400 dead Americans were being ''deliberately withheld'' by Vietnam. Mr. Shultz, an official said, called the Vietnamese action ''cruel and heartless.''  Later, after the news conference, the official who spoke about the possibility that Americans are still being held captive said that the information about the 400 American war dead came from a Vietnamese undertaker who defected to the United States several years ago. The official said the undertaker's account was also supported by the results of a polygraph test, the so-called lie-detector test.  The Mission Into Laos  The issue of missing serviceman returned to prominence this year when Mr. Gritz turned himself in to the Thai authorities, who had sought him for illegally crossing the border between Thailand and Laos.  Mr. Gritz, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, led a small band of Americans and Indochinese into Laos last year to try to find the missing dead and check reports about American prisoners.  Several prominent Americans, including William Shatner, the star of the television series ''Star Trek,'' later said they had helped pay for the Gritz mission. It failed when the men were discovered and attacked by Laotian military forces. Mr. Gritz and his colleagues fled back to Thailand.  After the mission was disclosed, the Reagan Administration denied claims by Mr. Gritz that he had received support from the Defense Department. The Administration also condemned the effort, saying it opposed illegal, cross-border forays.  At the news conference, Mr. Shultz said that working ''through official channels is probably in the long run the most effective method.'' But he added, ''Clearly, we are anxious to have any method used that would help return the remains of the deceased and provide information for us and for the families on those who are missing.''  Asked what sort of methods he would support, Mr. Shultz said, ''The key word is if it has a good chance of being effective.'' He also said, ''Of course, any means that can be effective we're for.''  Mr. Shultz is scheduled to fly from to New Delhi on Wednesday for two days of talks with Indian leaders. His Asian trip will end with a stop in Pakistan.  ----  8 War Dead Identified  WASHINGTON, June 28 (AP) - The Pentagon today identified eight Air Force and Navy dead from the Vietnam war who were turned over to an American delegation in Hanoi this month.  The Air Force members were Col. Larry W. Biediger of La Coste, Tex.; Col. John F. Dudash of Manville, N.J.; Col. Farrell Sullivan Jr. of Caddo Mills, Tex., and Lieut. Col. Merwin L.

"    McNamara had been a brilliant corporation executive who could scan a balance sheet with unerring speed and skill. When he made the first of his many trips to Vietnam in May 1962, he looked at the figures and concluded optimistically after only 48 hours in the country that ''every quantitative measurement . . . shows that we are winning the war.''  No conflict in history was studied in such detail as it was being waged. Military and civilian officials from nearly every Washington agency would sooner or later conduct surveys in Vietnam, along with specialists from dozens of private think tanks, like the Rand Corporation and the Stanford Research Institute. They included weapons technicians, economists, sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, agronomists, biologists, chemists and public opinion pollsters. They investigated the effects of defoliants, the impact of bombs, the efficiency of cannons. They scoured villages and interviewed peasants. They interrogated enemy defectors and prisoners. They pored over captured Communist documents and scrutinized Hanoi statements - and they produced voluminous graphs, charts, pamphlets, brochures and books. But the statistics somehow failed to convey an accurate picture of the problem, much less offer solutions.  For the missing element in the ''quantitative measurement'' that guided McNamara and other U.S. policymakers was the qualitative dimension that could not easily be recorded. There was no way to calibrate the motivation of Vietcong guerrillas. Nor could computers be programmed to describe the hopes and fears of Vietnamese peasants. The arcane maneuvers of Diem and his family also baffled U.S. diplomats, who were even less equipped to influence their decisions.  As the war intensified, American civilian officials and soldiers were spurred on by a myopic sense of ''can- doism'' - the conviction that, as Americans, they could achieve anything anywhere. Their belief in their own omnipotence was stimulated, too, by pressures from their superiors in Saigon and Washington. To adopt a negative attitude was defeatism, and there were no promotions for defeatists. In contrast, positive reports were rewarded, even if they bore little resemblance to the truth.  Yet another impulse that generated Americans in Vietnam was a brand of missionary zeal, not unlike the credo that had inspired early French imperialists. But Americans gave it a different guise. They were not imposing colonialism but, rather, helping the Vietnamese to perfect their institutions. They called it ''nation-building,'' and they would have been arrogant had they not been utterly sincere in their naive belief that they could really reconstruct Vietnamese society along Western lines.

"      It remains one of the final reminders that the Vietnam War is not completely over.  Once a month, in a State Department conference room, half a dozen Government officials and one outsider meet behind a closed door to discuss whatever new information and rumor has emerged about the fate of the 2,491 Americans missing in Indochina. The solemn bureacratic chatter is tinged with elements of anger, pain and heartbreak.  ''There is still, simply, a great deal of emotional drain for families,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. ''A lot of kids want to know what happened to their fathers. The drain continues, after all these years.''  Miss Griffiths, whose brother, Lieut. Comdr. Jim Mills, was shot down off the coast of Vietnam on Sept. 21, 1966, is the only non-Government participant at the monthly meetings, which are attended by representatives of the Pentagon, White House, Defense Intelligence Agency, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other agencies.  Although the meetings are listed as confidential, Miss Griffiths is allowed to attend because of the ''strong interest'' of the families involved. The chairman of the meetings is John Monjo, an Assistant Secretary of State.  Vietnamese 'Not Cooperative'  In the meantime, American and Vietnamese officials meet four times a year in Hanoi to exchange specific information about missing Americans, mostly Air Force and Navy pilots and crew members who were shot down over Vietnam and Laos.  ''The Vietnamese have not been cooperative to any appreciable extent,'' said one State Department official. ''They seem to dribble out remains as it suits their purpose. There's pretty good reason to believe they may have 400 remains, stacked up, ready to turn over at will, somewhere in Hanoi.''  Although the Vietnamese have denied this, the State Department official said that the information was based on ''credible information.''  Why would the Vietnamese hold such remains?  ''Everything they do, as far as we're concerned, is bound to reflect a political advantage they want to gain,'' said the official. ''We assume they would want to trade the remains for something in return.''  On the murky issue of whether surviving Americans are being held against their will, the State Department speaks in qualified tones.  Unconfirmed Sightings  ''It's conceivable,'' said one official. ''Our position is we have received a variety of reports of live sightings. We take action to investigate these. We have not been able to confirm that there are any Americans being held against their will in Indochina.''  In recent years there have been unconfirmed refugee reports of sightings of missing Americans in the jungles of Southeast Asia, as well as repeated accusations that the Hanoi Government was withholding remains. Hanoi has said that the dense jungles in which many Americans were lost during the war made it impossible for them to find further remains. Since the end of the war the Vietnamese have returned 87 bodies.  Officials believe there may be a certain number of American deserters and others, some married to local women, who have remained behind in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, at their own choice.  Miss Griffiths said that the revived interest in the fate of Americans in Indochina was the direct result of President Reagan's personal involvement in the issue.  ''It was different under Nixon, Ford and Carter,'' she said. ''That's changed now. This President cares.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 27 1983 ,11

"      China indirectly criticized the Soviet Union today for its support of the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. The move came as Soviet negotiators held talks here on ways to improve their troubled relations.  An analysis of recent Vietnamese actions on the Cambodian issue published by the official New China News Agency today did not mention Moscow, but China has consistently said Moscow's close ties with Hanoi encouraged Hanoi's occupation of Cambodia and threatened to disrupt the Pacific region.  The timing of the commentary to coincide with the current round of normalization talks between China and the Soviet Union made clear that Peking considered Moscow's backing for Hanoi a major block to relations, political analysts said.

"      Reagan Administration officials said today that differences within Vietnam's leadership may have delayed a response to an offer by the United States to accept thousands of political prisoners.  Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Sept. 11 that the United States was ready to take up a Vietnamese offer to release the prisoners from ''re-education camps'' to the Americans. In testimony before Congress, he said that over the next two years the United States was ready to take 10,000 prisoners who had ties to the United States or had served in the old South Vietnamese Government, which fell in April 1975. Figures vary, but 10,000 has been cited by Vietnamese authorities.  Mr. Shultz also said that the United States would accept all Asian-American children and their close family members over the next three years. The so-called Amerasians, largely fathered by American soldiers during the Vietnam War, have already been coming to the United States through a United Nations-administered program. Administration officials said that, after Mr. Shultz's speech, they had urged Vietnam to accelerate the processing of children eligible to leave.  Children's Exit Is Slow  Vietnam has said that all Amerasians can leave, and it has said that the United States has been slow in taking them. American officials say Vietnam shares responsibility by not assigning enough personnel to the children's emigration program.  With the children's program continuing, the United States had now begun to focus on the apparent Vietnamese hesitation to allow the departure of the political prisoners, who with their families make up about 30,000 people.  ''From some conversations we have had,'' an American official said, ''we are getting the impression that the security officials in Hanoi are very wary about releasing these prisoners to the United States. From the questions we have been asked there seems to be a worry in Hanoi that these prisoners will be turned into some kind of rebel military force against them, and they are in no rush to let them out.''  In 1982 Foreign Minister Nguyen Cao Thach said Vietnam would release the prisoners if the United States took them in. This was repeated last May, in an interview in Newsweek magazine, by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong.   Pham Van Dong Is Quoted  ''We are quite prepared to allow all of those left in the camps to leave tomorrow for the United States, but the United States Government has rejected that suggestion,'' he said. ''They prefer to leave these criminals free in Vietnam but not in the United States.''  The United States had not rejected the offer, but it was not publicly accepted until Mr. Shultz's testimony on Sept. 11. Since then there have been two meetings with Vietnamese officials to discuss the matter.  On Oct. 4 in Geneva, Robert L. Funseth, a State Department refugee official, met with Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and outlined specific suggestions.  The United States initially wanted to process the prisoners through the program administered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. But Vietnam wanted the matter dealt with directly by the United States, and Washington agreed.  Another issue raised by the Vietnamese was that the United States must take all the prisoners. Washington wanted to limit the program to those who have had some sort of affiliation with the United States or with the former South Vietnamese Government.  All May Be Eligible  ''We have told the Vietnamese that we have to have a list of who is in the camps and how many there are,'' a State Department official said. ''Who knows, maybe when we see the list it will turn out that everyone would be eligible.''  Richard Childress, the National Security Council expert on Indochina, met with Mr. Thach in New York last month when the Vietnamese Foreign Minister was there for the United Nations General Assembly.  Mr. Thach gave Mr. Childress the impression, a State Department official said, that he was in no hurry to move on the question of the prisoners. He was reported to have expressed concern that the prisoners might take the lead in an insurgency.  This suggested that even though he and Mr. Dong had publicly said all the prisoners could leave, the Vietnamese leadership had not yet reached a final decision.  Mr. Thach indicated that the children's program would continue in any event, and he was urged to speed the procedures.  U.S. Seeks 450 Children a Month  Last month 250 children and their relatives left Ho Chi Minh City for Bangkok, Thailand, on their way to the United States. The United States would like to raise monthly departures to at least 450, a State Department official said.  On the political prisoners, the United States plans to take the initiative if it does not hear soon from Vietnam. Some members of Congress, such as Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of New York, are planning to visit Vietnam by the end of the year, and State Department officials said that by then the Vietnamese would probably decide what to do.  State Department officials say that the talks with the Vietnamese have been limited to refugee matters and to the issue of finally accounting for all the Americans missing in action in the Vietnam War, and have not touched on a resumption of diplomatic relations.

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 23   Vietnam may not agree to release inmates of ''re- education'' camps for resettlement in the United States unless Washington promises to curtail what Hanoi describes as anti-Vietnamese activities among exiles in America, officials here told two American Congressmen this weekend.  The Foreign Ministry statements have raised an unexpected obstacle to a Reagan Administration plan, announced in September by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, to admit 8,000 to 10,000 inmates of the camps. Many of the inmates were imprisoned because of their ties to the United States or the American-backed former Government of South Vietnam.  On Saturday Phan Doan Nam, an assistant to Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, met with the two visiting Congressmen, Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey and a member of the committee. Mr. Nam told them that ''over the last few months'' Hanoi had concluded that Vietnamese living in the United States and Western Europe were supporting and organizing attacks on Vietnamese abroad and plotting subversion at home.  Four Sentenced to Death   In Ho Chi Minh City last week Vietnam tried 21 people and sentenced four of them to death for plotting rebellion. Nearly 100 more suspects are reported to be under arrest. Hanoi has charged that they were trained by China and Thailand and that at least some had links with the United States Embassy in Bangkok.  China, Thailand and the United States have denied the allegations.  Today the two Congressmen and their aides met privately with Foreign Minister Thach to discuss a range of issues. Mr. Solarz said after the meeting that Hanoi appeared to be less willing to cooperate with the United States in arranging the resettlement of political prisoners than it was in October, when the two nations met on the subject in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The idea of sending re- education camp inmates to the United States was first proposed by Vietnam.  Hanoi is now saying it wants concrete assurances Washington will curb Vietnamese exiles, Mr. Solarz said. He added that Hanoi sought to curtail not only what it regarded as activities directed against Vietnam, but also attacks ''against our friends in Central America.'' Some Vietnamese-Americans are reported to have joined rebels fighting the Sandinista Government in Nicaragua.  'All Over the United States'   Mr. Nam, who is considered a rising star in Hanoi's Foreign Ministry, said on Saturday that there appeared to be anti-Vietnamese organizations ''all over the United States.''  He said these activists had been responsible for attacks on the Vietnamese Mission to the United Nations in New York and on a Vietnamese writer slain in Los Angeles.  (In Washington, a State Department official said the United States was not aware of any violent attacks on the Vietnamese Mission. He said that there had been demonstrations in recent years but that they had been orderly. The official said he had no details on the possible slaying of a writer.)  ''These people are criminals,'' Mr. Nam said of past and present political prisoners. ''In this case, how can we let them go? It is impossible to hand over weapons to be fired against us.''  Mr. Nam made clear, however, that Hanoi did not believe rebellion within Vietnam was being directed from the American Embassy in Bangkok, despite what he said was evidence of meetings subversives had there with United States diplomats. He and other officials place most of the blame on China.  Hanoi's demands that the United States curb anti-Vietnamese dissent posed problems, Mr. Solarz said, ''because their definition of subversive activities could include anything from writing articles or taking part in demonstrations to sending arms.''  Optimism on Amerasians   He said that while Congress and the American public were strongly in favor of seeing existing laws on illegal activities against foreign governments enforced, Hanoi had to understand that there were certain American freedoms that must be respected.  In talks with the Congressmen this weekend, Hanoi reportedly remained willing to move quickly on another refugee matter, the resettlement in the United States of children fathered by Americans in Vietnam. ''They are already U.S. citizens,'' Mr. Nam said Saturday. ''And you should look after them. We would give them all up in six months.''  Mr. Solarz and Mr. Torricelli are on a six-day visit to Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Mr. Solarz also visited Bhopal, India, to talk to officials about the disaster at the Union Carbide pesticide factory there.  The stop in Cambodia, scheduled for Monday, has brought criticism from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which does not recognize the Vietnamese-backed Government of Heng Samrin in Phnom Penh. The United States also does not recognize the Phnom Penh Government.  Thailand's Foreign Minister, Siddhi Savetsila, said that the Congressmen's visit to Cambodia ''would send the wrong signal to Hanoi.'' Vietnam has 150,000 to 180,000 troops in Cambodia to support the Government, which it installed in 1979 after invading the country in late 1978 tooverthrow the Government of Pol Pot.  Mr. Solarz has told Vietnamese officials that better ties between Hanoi and the United States, which now have no diplomatic relations, depend on Vietnamese willingness to withdraw from Cambodia. He is going to Phnom Penh, he said, to assess the position of the Government there on various proposals that could lead to Vietnamese withdrawal.     U.S. Hopes for Formal Talks     WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 - State Department officials said today that the United States hoped to have formal talks with Vietnam to gain the release of inmates in re-education camps.  The officials said Vietnam had not yet formally told Washington why it had delayed the release. The United States, one official said, views resettlement of the inmates as a humanitarian gesture with little political cost to Hanoi.  Another official said the Administration could not limit the rights of Vietnamese exiles in this country to call for an end to Communist rule. ''There are obviously free speech guarantees,'' he said. ''If the Vietnamese are worried about advocacy, we wouldn't be able to satisfy them.''  The official added, however, that American laws against arms shipments by private citizens to resistance movements elsewhere could and would be enforced.  Administration officials have been skeptical for several months that Vietnam would follow through on its promise to release the political prisoners held in the camps.

"      The Vietnamese Government, lacking formal diplomatic ties with the United States, has asked an organization of American veterans of the Vietnam War to visit Hanoi every three months for talks on a variety of issues.  The Reagan Administration says it opposes the plan, but a State Department official indicated it would probably not try to prevent the veterans group from talking to the Vietnamese. The group, the Vietnam Veterans of America, says it will not seek to negotiate on behalf of the United States Government.  The meetings are expected to touch on such subjects as American servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia, the resettlement of children of American servicemen and Vietnamese women from Vietnam to the United States and cultural exchanges. The date of the first meeting has not yet been set.  The arrangement was disclosed as Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, postponed a scheduled meeting with American officials to discuss the question of some 2,490 American servicemen still listed as missing.

Muller, a former United States Marine lieutenant who was wounded in Vietnam in 1969 and is now president of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said in an interview that Mr. Thach and other Vietnamese officials had invited the veterans group to send delegations to Hanoi at least every three months to serve as intermediaries between the two Governments.  The invitation was extended when Mr. Thach met Mr. Muller and six other veterans in Hanoi two weeks ago, Mr. Muller said.  ''They expressed to us many times the desire to work directly with the U.S. Government on issues such as Amerasians and Agent Orange information,'' Mr. Muller said. ''But our Government will not talk to them. So we do represent the only channel with which to exchange information.''  One State Department official, referring to the Vietnamese-backed regime in Cambodia, said the United States ''will not consider normalization of relations with Vietnam as long as it occupies Kampuchea.''  Some Informal Contacts  Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, maintaining that it did so in order to save the country from the atrocities of Mr. Pol Pot's regime. Since then the United States has had some informal contacts with Vietnam, including visits by United States officials and Congressmen as well as veterans to Hanoi.  ''We see our role as providing a bridge to Vietnam, a conduit to dialogue,'' Mr. Muller added. ''The U.S. has expressed to us the desire that we do not conduct these discussions with Vietnam.''  Lyall Breckon, director of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodian affairs at the State Department, who met with some of the veterans on Friday, said, ''As a general principle, in the resolution of the P.O.W. and M.I.A. issue, we believe that Government to Government contacts are the correct way to approach and resolve the issue.''  Another State Department official said the Administration opposed the intercession of the veterans group.  ''We try to consult very closely with Vietnam organizations and the families but we think these issues are best handled through Government channels,'' he said, adding that, as far as he knew, the State Department ''will not stand in the way of the veterans.''  List Issues for Talks  Mr. Muller said the veterans would seek to help deal with such issues as missing servicemen, the acceleration of the resettlement of children of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers, the visit of American scientists studying the effects of the herbicide Agent Orange, which was sprayed by United States forces to defoliate jungle battlefields, as well as cultural exchanges and visits.  In the last two years the United States has sought infrequent official visits to Hanoi, mostly by Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage, who has traveled to Hanoi to inquire about Americans missing in action. Mr. Armitage last visited Vietnam in February.  Since the end of the war in 1975, the remains of 88 soldiers have been returned, and the Reagan Administration has not ruled out the possibility that some Americans captured during the war are still alive. The Hanoi Government denies such a possibility.  Mr. Muller said he saw the role of the veterans as ''serving as a backstop, monitoring progress'' as well as lobbying Congress on several issues including the plight of Amerasian children. Mr. Muller pointed out that there are an estimated 25,000 to 40,000 of the children in Vietnam. They are treated as outcasts, but only 1,000 have been resettled so far in the United States.  A key reason for the small number of the children in the United States, Mr. Muller said, was the fact that quota restrictions in the United States had limited their emigration from Vietnam. Mr. Muller said that Vietnamese officials had told him that American officials had suggested that more children would be allowed into the United States if the Vietnamese released a number of prisoners in ''re-education camps'' who had worked for the United States Embassy during the war.  A State Department official said: ''There's absolutely no connection. The Amerasian children are one issue. Another issue is we'd like to see movement on the Vietnamese held in re- education camps to whom we feel a special responsibility. The Vietnamese have so far refused to release people from these camps.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 22 1984 ,11
"    PENH, Cambodia, July 1   A senior Vietnamese official says continuing United States unfriendliness toward Vietnam after a war that ravaged the civilian population has hurt Hanoi's efforts to get villagers to cooperate in searching for missing Americans.  ''Members of my family were killed,'' the official said in an interview here last week with visiting foreign journalists. ''Even my friends, even those who are alive, I don't know where they are. Now the Americans are not friendly to us. How can we get the people's support?''  He said that the United States, without reciprocating, is ''imposing'' efforts on Vietnam and Cambodia to resolve cases of Americans listed as missing in action.  BANGKOK, Thailand, July 1 (AP) - A United States Embassy spokesman, responding to the Vietnamese official's remarks, said, ''The Vietnamese authorities have agreed with us at a very senior level that resolution of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue is a humanitarian matter to be dealt with separate from other issues.''

"   , Vietnam, July 17   Vietnam turned over bones believed to be those of eight American servicemen today.  The bones, packed in separate wooden crates, were checked briefly at Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport by United States specialists and loaded onto an Air Force cargo plane for transport to a military identification center in Hawaii.  Officials from both countries said they would soon resume quarterly technical meetings to discuss Americans listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War.  Richard Stevenson, a public affairs officer with the United States Pacific Command, said the talks would probably resume by the end of August. They were interrupted last year by Vietnam, which was angry over American criticism that Hanoi was dragging its feet on the issue.  Hanoi has previously returned the remains of 88 Americans.

"    To the Editor:   Your July 6 news story ''Shultz Seeks to Assure Asians on China Arms'' erred in stating that the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and the United States have agreed not to establish diplomatic relations or provide assistance to Vietnam until it accepts a plan for pulling its troops out of Cambodia and having internationally supervised elections.''  Of the six Asean members, five (Indochina, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore) maintain diplomatic relations with Vietnam and, except for Singapore, have embassies in Hanoi. They maintain a dialogue (however erratic) on the Cambodian problem with Hanoi's leaders.  After almost six years of unyielding Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, the case has not been convincingly made that freezing the United States out of a diplomatic relationship with Vietnam will further Asean's (and Washington's) goal of an independent Cambodia.  Why can't the United States be a strong advocate where it counts - in Hanoi - and, at the same time, drive a wedge into the Soviets' threatening military buildup in Vietnam by offering Hanoi an alternative? With a presence in Hanoi, U.S. officials also would be in a better position to gather information about the almost 2,500 American servicemen still listed as missing in action.  You also reported that some Asean countries ''have urged Washington to provide the Sihanouk and Son Sann forces with military equipment or cash to buy arms.'' Washington's public position is that it will provide only humanitarian aid to the Cambodian refugees inside Thailand and political support for Cambodia's resistance coalition government seated at the United Nations.  However, reports are beginning to surface that the United States already may be funneling direct covert aid (probably cash payments) to the Sihanouk and Son Sann forces (see Far Eastern Economic Review, June 28, p.16). If such reports prove accurate, and if Asean prevails upon Secretary Shultz during their consultations in Jakarta this month, there is a danger that the United States will increasingly resort to covert military assistance instead of diplomatic initiatives ( a la Nicaragua) to underpin its foreign policy in Indochina.

"      Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Hanoi Government had agreed to meet again next month on the issue of the nearly 2,500 Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.  He made the disclosure in a speech to the Honolulu Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Shultz arrived on Tuesday at the end of a 10-day trip to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.  On Tuesday, Vietnam handed over the remains of what it believed to be eight Americans, and they arrived today at Hickam Air Force Base here from Manila. A special armed forces center here will try to confirm the tentative identifications.  The technical talks with Vietnam on the possible whereabouts of the 2,490 still listed as missing, most of them now believed dead, began in mid-1982 and were to be held every three months.  Talks Were Suspended in '83  But after a session in June 1983, the Vietnamese canceled further meetings after being criticized by the United States Government and by the National League of P.O.W.-M.I.A. Families, which will hold its annual meeting in Washington this weekend to discuss the issue of possible remaining prisoners of war and missing in action.  Aides to Mr. Shultz said about half the missing were believed to have been killed in action. In those cases, where planes were seen crashing, a military aide said, there is no expectation of anything more than receiving the remains if the Vietnamese were to cooperate by sending search teams to areas where the United States knows the planes crashed.  The aide said there were 400 to 500 Americans on which ''a reasonable effort by the Vietnamese ought to come up with positive results.''  An area of particular concern involves 50 to 60 Americans who were photographed alive in Vietnam after being captured or were seen alive soon after falling into Vietnamese hands. The Vietnamese have provided no information on them.  150 'Live Sightings' Reported  In addition, aides said, there have been 150 ''live sightings.'' These sightings, often reported by Vietnamese refugees, are unverified accounts of Vietnamese seeing unidentified whites in remote areas. These purported sightings have generated periodic rumors that some Americans might still be alive in Vietnam.  Aides to Mr. Shultz said that, while it could not be definitively ruled out that some Americans might be alive, there was no supporting evidence to indicate that there were any.  By 1979, the Vietnamese said every living American had been returned. But then came the repatriation of Pfc. Robert R. Garwood of the Marines, who had stayed behind, and his case cast doubt on Vietnam's assurances.  An aide said 17 full-time analysts in the Defense Intelligence Agency keep track of the missing-in-action category and of reports of possible sightings.  Two Criteria for Hanoi Ties  The United States has said that it will not establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam until two criteria are met: All the missing in action must be accounted for, and Vietnam must agree to an acceptable formula for removing its 160,000 troops from Cambodia.  In the Honolulu speech, Mr. Shultz reflected the Reagan Administration's view that Asia was the area offering the most opportunity in the future for American policy makers.  Noting American economic interests and diplomatic efforts in the region, he put particular stress on the need for a strong United States military presence. He said there was ''an enormous concentration of military power'' by nations unfriendly to the United States and its allies. He mentioned Vietnam, North Korea and the Soviet Union.  As to the question of military cooperation with China, an issue he found to be sensitive to Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia that are concerned about possible Chinese expansionism, Mr. Shultz said:  ''Careful discussions have begun on ways in which American technology and equipment might better enable China to counter Soviet military intimidation. This is an important development, but it is also an area where we give careful consideration to the concerns of our allies and other friends in the region.''

"      President Reagan said today that Laos had agreed to allow United States officials to excavate a site to search for the remains of 13 American servicemen whose plane crashed there nearly 12 years ago.  Mr. Reagan made the disclosure during a ceremony at the White House in honor of National P.O.W./M.I.A. Recognition Day. At the ceremony, the President said the Administration was determined to recover the remains and press for information on 2,489 Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, as well as 8,177 from the Korean War.  About 600 of the 2,489 were reported dead or missing in Laos. The Vientiane Government met with American officials last year and allowed a technical team to visit the crash site, near the city of Pakse.    Maintained Diplomatic Ties  The United States, which severed diplomatic relations with Vietnam and Cambodia after the Communist takeovers there in 1975, has maintained diplomatic relations with Laos, but has said ties could not be improved until the missing-in-action issue was resolved.  Today, Mr. Reagan said Laos ''seems to have gained a greater understanding of the importance to us of the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue.''  ''We, in return, have gained a greater understanding of their feelings and problems,'' he said. ''This process has led us to discussions of joint crash site searches.''    'Working Out the Details'  ''And in this regard, I want to pass on some good news to you,'' he said. ''Late last night, we were informed by the Government of Laos of official agreement in principle to excavation of a U.S. crash site. We're working out the details now. We welcome this cooperative gesture.''  A Defense Department spokesman said Mr. Reagan was referring to an Air Force gunship that exploded in midair on Dec. 21, 1972, near Pakse, with 16 men aboard. Two parachuted to safety, and one body was found the next day.  At the ceremony today, with many former prisoners of war and families of missing in action in the audience, Mr. Reagan said the prisoners of war ''have been, and are, the bravest of the brave.''  ''They kept a trusting heart, they retained their spirit and their will, and they kept the faith,'' he said. ''They trusted us, and that trust did us great honor.''  He pledged that the Administration would make a major effort on behalf of the missing in action, or those who are assumed to be killed, but whose remains have not been recovered. Mr. Reagan, implicitly seeming to criticize past Administrations, said the families of the missing had for many years ''stood alone in your quest for answers.''  ''Well, today, you're not alone,'' he said. ''And I tell you from my heart, you will never be alone again.''  'Sightings' by Refugees  Of the 2,489 Americans listed as unaccounted for, about 1,150 have been reported killed in action, but their remains have not been recovered. Of the others, American officials have said there is no verified evidence that any are alive, although there have been ''sightings.'' Most such sightings have been by Vietnamese refugees, who say they have seen people they assumed to be Americans.  On Wednesday Secretary of State George P. Shultz said that Vietnam had agreed to resume talks in mid-August on locating the remains and providing information on those unaccounted for in Vietnam.  Mr. Reagan, noting that today was the 30th anniversary of the signing of agreements in Geneva on Indochina, said the hoped-for peace had never come to that part of the world. He said Vietnam and the United States ''still have major differences.''  But he said he was ''encouraged'' by Vietnam's willingness to cooperate on the missing-in-action question.  8,177 Missing in Korea  Mr. Reagan said resolution of that issue, as well as Vietnam's agreement to negotiations on Cambodia with other countries in the area, ''provide the key for ending Vietnam's isolation.''  ''Normal relations with the international community can bring an end to the long suffering of the people of Vietnam,'' he said. ''And I believe it to be in Vietnam's own interest to choose this path. It's a decision that we would welcome.''  Mr. Reagan also addressed the less publicized situation in Korea, where 8,177 Americans are officially listed as unaccounted for. He said the United States had pressed North Korea for an accounting of any missing from that war. He also said some Korean War veterans recently provided information on possible grave locations.  A White House official said the information was on possible sites in South Korea, and talks were going on with the South Korean Government. But neither State Department nor Pentagon officials were able to shed light on why it had taken so long to find sites in South Korea, a United States ally.

"   , L.I.   A terrible wrong was committed 11 years ago: 566 servicemen lost in Laos were abandoned without a trace. While almost 600 war prisoners held in North Vietnam came home in early 1973, not one of the 566 has ever come home - dead or alive. This tragedy continues.  Gen. Eugene Tighe, who at the time was director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, recently testified that he believed that our men were still held in Laos. Privately, D.I.A. analysts concede that P.O.W.'s are still alive there, differing only on how many there are. The most recent estimates range from 20 to 253.  Hundreds of recent refugee reports, verified with ''lie-detector'' machines, describe similar scenes: American pilots are held virtually as slaves in caves and remote villages, guarded by Vietnamese and Laotian soldiers, at times forced to repair American weapons and electronic equipment left over from the war.  How did this happen? On Jan. 27, 1973, America and North Vietnam signed the Paris Peace Accords, which provided for the return of all P.O.W.'s in Vietnam. Neighboring Laos was not a participant and no provision was made for return of P.O.W.'s there.  On Feb. 1, 1973, President Richard M. Nixon sent to Prime Minister Pham Van Dong a letter pledging $3.25 billion in reconstruction funds if Hanoi honored the treaty - and if Congress appropriated the money. In exchange, Hanoi was to provide a complete list of all P.O.W.'s in Laos. It did not. To this day, it has provided no information on any of the 566.  Then, on Feb. 5, 1973, an American bomber was shot down in Laos with seven men on board. National Se  curity Agency radio intercepts confirm that four were taken prisoner. Nothing has been done about them.  Meanwhile, Capitol Hill made it clear that it would not appropriate the $3.25 billion. But Hanoi had shrewdly created an insurance policy against the possibility that the money would fall through: the P.O.W.'s in Laos were a bargaining chip.  By early March, it was obvious the funds would not be voted. Henry A. Kissinger, architect of the Paris treaty and then national security adviser, dispatched Robert C. McFarlane, now President Reagan's national security adviser, to Paris to make a new offer: America would exchange $100 million in medicine for the P.O.W.'s in Laos. Hanoi did not deny the P.O.W.'s were there; instead, it countered: We don't want just $100 million; we want the $3.25 billion Nixon promised us. With Congress unwilling to appropriate this sum, and Hanoi unwilling to settle for less, the Administration was stuck.  Just when the public should have been informed of the dilemma, Watergate convulsed the nation. Vietnam and Laos took a back seat.  For 11 years, Hanoi has positioned itself to ''find'' the P.O.W.'s. In a private message to me in September 1981, its ambassador to Thailand said: ''Cases of Americans reportedly captured but not registered with the center responsible for P.O.W.'s require time for investigation and searching. Failure to register these cases was due to many war circumstances which led to their missing on the way from the places of capture to the detention centers.'' In a face-saving manner, the North Vietnamese continue to give themselves an ''out.''  Why does the situation remain unresolved? Because Hanoi's policy is not to ''find'' the P.O.W.'s until Washington stops supporting Peking, opens full diplomatic relations with Hanoi and makes good on past promises. And because of the Reagan Administration's refusal to improve relations until Hanoi makes a complete accounting of all the P.O.W.'s. The P.O.W.'s must wonder: ''Why has America abandoned us?''  How to break this stalemate?  One Communist official told me in 1981: ''How can we ask our peasants to look for your (troops) when you have destroyed all our schools and hospitals? If America gives our people hospitals and schools, then we can ask these peasants to look for your (troops).''  The only way to bring home the P.O.W.'s is to swallow some pride in admitting that we lost the war and that Hanoi holds all the cards. We must provide, without a quid pro quo, a multibillion dollar reconstruction program involving medicine, hospitals, X-ray equipment, schools and other nonmilitary humanitarian aid.  We don't put a price on human life; the North Vietnamese do. B  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: OP-ED                      ",August 20 1984 ,11
"      Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said Tuesday that his country would welcome attempts by a third party to promote peace in Cambodia, the Kyodo news agency reported today.  Mr. Thach also said Hanoi would continue searching for American soldiers missing since the Vietnam War and repeated his nation's willingness to allow political dissidents to leave the country, Kyodo reported in a dispatch from Hanoi.  The agency said Mr. Thach told its correspondent that Vietnam would unconditionally negotiate a peace proposal by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has demanded that free elections be held in Cambodia and that Vietnam withdraw its troops from the country.  ''It would be better to form an international supervisory commission by neutral nations and let it play the role of peacekeeping in Cambodia,'' Mr. Thach was quoted as having said.  His statement appeared to reverse Vietnam's previous policy rejecting the United Nations as a mediator and an Indonesian proposal for the creation of an international supervisory group.

"   , Thailand, Jan. 4   Two of five men condemned to death in a highly publicized subversion trial in Vietnam have had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment, Vietnam's official press agency reported.  The death sentences were handed down Dec. 18 at the end of the trial in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. A total of 21 men were tried on charges of seeking to overthrow the Vietnamese Government with Chinese backing. Apart from the 5 men sentenced to death, 3 were sentenced to life imprisonment and the rest got terms ranging from 8 to 20 years. The trial was reported to be the biggest espionage and treason trial since the capture of South Vietnam in 1975.  Statements made in court indicate that the five convicted men, said to be linked to a Vietnamese exile group based in France, may have managed to draw a few local Vietnamese officials into their plot. One such official was reported to have committed suicide when his complicity became known.  2 Claim French Citizenship   The two men whose death sentences were commuted Thursday, Mai Van Hanh, 56 years old, and Huynh Vinh Sanh, 63, both claim French nationality. France regards Mr. Hanh, a former pilot accused of being the ringleader of the plot, as a French citizen; Paris has not ruled on Mr. Sanh's claim. French diplomats in Vietnam were not permitted to visit the men.  Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and the French Ambassador in Hanoi had appealed for clemency for all five of the condemned. No mention was made in the statement Thursday of the other three men, Tran Van Ba, 39; Le Quoc Quan, 43, and Ho Thi Bach, 48.  Several men accused of leading the plot, including Mr. Hanh, were reported to have arrived in Vietnam in September. They were seized and brought to trial with other prisoners who had been held for several years on subversion charges.  Nearly 100 other people were reported to be awaiting trial on similar offenses.  In Hanoi, Vietnamese officials have said that evidence emerging from this trial played a part in the decision to pull back from their plan to release to the United States the inmates of the ''re-education'' camps. They say they fear the exiles would join subversive groups abroad working against Hanoi.  Vietnam has also said that at least one of the plotters who received a death sentence, Mr. Ba, a former student leader, had made contact with American diplomats in Bangkok. The United States has denied the accusation.  According to Hanoi's investigations, the plot had reached surprisingly serious proportions. Vietnam has said the plotters intended to begin a campaign of terrorism in several cities early this year, while at the same time ''encircling the towns'' through subversion in the countryside.  Seen as a Warning   Diplomats in Hanoi, interviewed just after the trial, said they doubted there was a significant subversive movement in Vietnam. But they said there continued to be dissatisfaction in the south centered around Ho Chi Minh City, and that Hanoi appeared to be serving notice on would-be rebels.  Some Vietnamese exiles who have fled the southern part of the country and are now in holding centers along the Thai-Cambodian border say there is an armed underground, but they have no reliable evidence of its size.  The accused, court documents said, had intended to open prison camps and arm the inmates, many of them former South Vietnamese officers.  Several religious figures, including a leader of the Cao Dai sect, were singled out at the trial and in the collected evidence as participants or sympathizers. This has been interpreted as a warning to religious groups not to take part in dissident activities.    Vietnam Announces Cease-Fire   BANGKOK, Jan. 4 (Reuters) - Vietnam will observe a 41-day cease-fire along its border with China to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations between them and to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the Vietnam News Agency said today.

"    HOW should we regard Vietnam today - as a nation to be pitied, admired, distrusted, despised? ''Vietnam Under Communism,'' the ''Frontline'' documentary on Channel 13 at 9 tonight, straddles the answer. This ought to be a good thing; a dispassionate examination of Vietnam is to be prized. At the same time, the documentary doesn't quite allow us to find our own answer. In part, its even- handedness gets in the way.  Thus ''Vietnam Under Communism'' opens with what almost seems like standard agitprop. Guns flash and bombs fall in old black-and-white film. Solemnly, the narrator speaks:  ''Christmas in Hanoi - 1972. America unleashes a barrage on the capital of North Vietnam. The bombing, aimed at both the backs and the spirits of the people, is relentless, devastating, but in vain.''  Then we see Vietnam today - rusted-out American tanks, lush green fields, children singing about Ho Chi Minh. A solitary soldier stands guard on the bank of a river while a junk sails by. Listen to the narrator now:  ''This is Vietnam today - patient, proud, hopeful - a nation at peace.''   An instant later, however (and forget for a moment that Vietnam is not at peace; it is fighting in Cambodia and sometimes along its own northern border), the documentary makes it clear that life in Vietnam is grim. Corruption abounds. People are ''ill fed, impoverished.'' They live in ''a totalitarian society.'' They are ''resigned,'' and their only triumph seems to be that they have endured.  Clearly, the documentary is trying to be ideologically equitable, balancing East and West. But it's being self- conscious while it does it. It's trying too hard, and we are not sure what to think. We see street scenes, markets and rice paddies, but it is as if we're at a distance. Granted that this viewer saw a version of the documentary that was without Judy Woodruff's opening and closing comments. It was still clear a point of view was missing.  Thus the documentary examines the tragedy of Vietnam's divided families: fathers and husbands who have left the country, leaving wives and children behind. A Vietnamese official says that the wives and children may also leave, but that emigration has slowed because the United States declines to accept refugees.  Then, in an interview, Assistant Secretary of State Paul D. Wolfowitz says that the United States ''got out 3,500 kids and their families.'' Certainly that is not many; the figure seems to uphold Vietnam's claim that the United States does not accept enough refugees.  On the other hand, ''Vietnam Under Communism'' then offers ample evidence that Hanoi does not care about the divided families, and that humanitarianism does not move it. Again we have balance: accusation, rebuttal and counter-rebuttal. But the human dimension seems to get lost.   Consequently, ''Vietnam Under Communism'' seems detached, unduly fearful of making judgments. It's a pity. We expect and demand, even if unrealistically, more than we get. Western television crews have not had much access to Vietnam since Hanoi's triumph, and WCCO of Minneapolis, which is presenting the film for public television, apparently was granted a 35-day visa.  Nonetheless, the documentary ought to be watched. As the Australian Ambassador to Vietnam says in an interview, we ''can't ignore a country of 16 million.'' '' Vietnam Under Communism'' doesn't satisfy our curiosity about Vietnam, but at least it demystifies a mysterious place. The documentary was produced, written and directed by Greg Pratt.

"   , Vietnam, Jan. 27   ''Vietnam has lived without you for a thousand years, and we can live without you for a thousand more,'' a Foreign Ministry official told a group of visiting Americans recently.  But diplomats and development experts from both Western and Eastern bloc nations, interviewed here on the eve of the arrival Monday of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, tell a different story. Vietnam, they say, is desperately in need of Western assistance and wants to improve its relations with the United States.  The major stumbling block is Hanoi's occupation of Cambodia, which has led to the curtailment of most Western aid and stood in the way of the establishment of diplomatic ties with Washington. The visit of Mr. Perez de Cuellar, his first to Hanoi as Secretary General, is therefore being watched closely by diplomats for signs of new initiatives on Cambodia from Hanoi.  In assessing the impasse, the Vietnamese leadership appears to be torn between staying in Cambodia for reasons of national security and finding a way to leave in the hope of attracting more development aid.  Major Health Problems  Vietnam, the diplomats and aid officials say, is a country where malnutrition and intestinal infections that have disappeared from many parts of Asia are still the major health problems. It is a country where the standards of many goods and services are falling rather than rising, where one of the most sought-after skills is the repair and rehabilitation of obsolete machinery.  ''Every time I pass through Bangkok on my way here,'' an American scholar said, ''I see the gap between Thailand and Vietnam getting wider.''  According to its own official figures, Vietnam failed to meet most of its major economic targets last year. Nearly a decade after the fall of Saigon, Vietnam (with a per-capita income lower than India's) ranks with its allies Laos and Cambodia as the poorest nation in Southeast Asia.  The evidence can be seen in the streets of Hanoi, a beautiful city almost unchanged architecturally since it was abandoned by the French 30 years ago. Shabbily dressed people crowd into rundown homes and ride ancient trams brought here decades ago from Strasbourg. Drinking water is no longer chlorinated, the electricity supply is erratic. A worker's basic wage hovers around one dollar a month at the black market exchange rate, about $25 at the inflated official rate. A bicycle, most people's only form of transportation, can cost as much as $100.  Guerrilla Camps Emptied  Vietnam's critics say Hanoi may have already decided not to give ground on the Cambodia issue, particularly now that its troops have successfully emptied the guerrilla camps of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, the larger of two non-Communist opposition groups loosely allied with the Communist Khmer Rouge against the Vietnamese-backed Government in Phnom Penh.  Hanoi, diplomats say, may be hoping instead to persuade the United Nations, which has called for Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia and does not recognize the Phnom Penh regime, to accept the status quo.  If this is true, diplomats say, the reasons are manifold and complex, more often conjecture than known, because Hanoi remains one of the toughest, most distrustful and most secretive of capitals in which to work.  This atmosphere, according to foreign residents, grows out of an overriding obsession with national security, born of 40 years of war and possibly encouraged by the presence of large numbers of Soviet advisers.  ''It is impossible to exaggerate the paranoia of Vietnam,'' a diplomat said.  Internal Discord Suggested  These fears of vulnerability, coupled with a historical tendency to see Greater Indochina as its sphere of influence, make Hanoi reluctant to abandon the Cambodian buffer, diplomats say. Some diplomats sympathetic to Vietnam say Hanoi may have rightly calculated that the loss of control over Cambodia may be too high a price to pay for what might turn out to be a disappointing amount of Western aid.  Internal disagreements may also be playing a part in the reluctance to compromise on Cambodia, diplomats suggest. Hanoi's apparent change of heart on the release of ''re-education'' camp inmates - now called ''criminals'' here - may reflect pressure on foreign- policy makers from national and provincial security officials, some diplomats say.  Fears of foreign-supported subversion has kept high the level of accusatory polemics directed at China, Thailand and the United States. What is not certain, according to diplomats, is whether this hard line is unanimous. They say there seem to be those in the leadership who want better Chinese ties and who might prefer working with Peking than Moscow despite centuries of China-Vietnam rivalry.  Preoccupation with security has led, aid experts say, to an inattention to development needs. There has been little long-range planning and little construction of necessary energy plants, roads and buildings. Without this, economic experts say, gaps between Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (and China under its new economic policies) will grow geometrically.  Heavy Spending on Army  Vietnam, already heavily in debt to the Soviet bloc, is now thought to spend more than half its gross national product on the military and maintains the world's fourth-largest armed forces.  There are known to be younger men in the ranks of future political leaders who want to outgrow the ''perpetual struggle'' mentality of the past and concentrate more on economic development, taking a more pragmatic approach and drawing on Western technological and management skills. Efforts to loosen controls on both agriculture and small industry have already paid off in some areas, but the experiment remains controversial.  Disagreements over budget and planning policies may be holding up the calling of the next party congress, some diplomats suggest.  Soviet aid, thought to be worth more than a billion dollars a year, has had little effect on daily life, residents of Hanoi say. East bloc equipment is sometimes technically inferior and inappropriate for Vietnam's needs, aid experts add.  ''I have seen a new machine come off the boat from Eastern Europe that was 30 years out of date the day it was made,'' an aid official said, ''These people deserve better.''

"   , Thailand, Jan. 31   Vietnam's Foreign Minister said today that Hanoi would welcome a more active American role in solving the problems of Southeast Asia.  Speaking at a news conference in Hanoi marking the end of a three-day visit to Vietnam by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said of the Americans:  ''If they can can make a war here, they can easily make a peace.''  For his part, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said he was ''very agreeably surprised'' at the positive responses he got from the Vietnamese on ''three or four'' issues the United States had asked him to raise in Hanoi.  One of these issues involves the nearly 2,500 Americans still missing from the Vietnam War. Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials say they plan to meet with Americans next month to further explore the technicalities of searching for remains.  Speaking to reporters on his flight back to Bangkok this afternoon, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said he was buoyed by his reception in Hanoi. ''Mr. Thach said the time is right for finding a solution to the problem of Cambodia - and that's enough for me.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 30 1985 ,11
"   , Vietnam, Jan. 30   The old man sits on the post office steps, a bathroom scale on the sidewalk beside him. The little scale, a vintage model, is his livelihood, and he has covered all but its dial with a piece of used plastic to protect this most valuable possession from the mud of a drizzly day.  For less than a penny the old man weighs people, bending down slowly and with great effort to focus his weak eyes on the numbers. Reading out a customer's weight is part of the service. He accepts payment without expression and returns wearily to his step.  With severe shortages of most consumer goods and minimal public services, Hanoi's residents continue to draw on their resourcefulness. The old man with his scale is but one of hundreds, if not thousands, of small entrepreneurial efforts on city sidewalks.    A Gradual Improvement  Frequent visitors to Hanoi say that over the last five or six years, the quality of life has improved in this capital city, a fine example of French colonial architecture that was damaged surprisingly little by American bombing in 1972. There are more goods in the stores, more television sets in homes and brighter colors on people and buildings.  But Hanoi and the overpopulated, impoverished north, its soil depleted and its forests fast disappearing, are still a world away from southern Vietnam.    Making Do in the North  In the south, consumer goods apparently are abundant. The Deputy Mayor of Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, boasts that food rations have tripled in a decade and that most businesses with fewer than 20 employees are in private hands. So is two-thirds of the city's housing, he adds.  ''One country, two systems,'' people here say sardonically, echoing the formula the Chinese have used to describe how Peking hopes to coexist with Hong Kong when it reverts to Chinese rule.  Hanoi's residents have come to assume that most things unavailable here must be found in the south. Requests for a commodity or service - a certain book, a restaurant, a map, a telex, an international telephone line or a taxi - are met with the stock, almost reflexive, reply: ''We don't have it in Hanoi, but in Saigon. . . . '' So in Hanoi, people make do. Entrepreneurs fix bicycles, refill the refills of ballpoint pens or sell things: dumplings, bowls of soup, vegetables from their gardens, individual envelopes or cigarettes, handmade objects of bamboo and straw. Moneychangers, paying more than 20 times the official exchange rate for foreign currency, thrive.  Recyling is an art: The pull-tab from an imported aluminum can is bought for a fraction of a cent and used to make curtain rings. The can itself fetches anywhere from a dime to more than a dollar and has many uses. Old movie film is fashioned into celluloid picture frames.  At night a visitor passes an old woman selling used bottles of all sizes in the front room of her home. A few people beg, and others sleep huddled in doorways.  Although such scenes of everyday life might not suggest it, this is a year of celebrations for Vietnam. In October Hanoi celebrated 30 years of liberation from the French. In April Ho Chi Minh City, which its own tourist bureau still calls Saigon, will mark the 10th anniversary of the Communist victory over South Vietnam's American-supported Government.  In between, the army marked its 40th birthday in December, a reminder that after 40 years Vietnam is still at war - now in Cambodia and on the border with China - and another generation is being called on to make sacrifices.  The Peach Blossoms of Tet  This is not to say that all is sacrifice and no amusement in Hanoi. The city's young people seek their pleasures in movies, in window-shopping at Government stores or in walks by the city's lakes or in its parks, now sprinkled with the pink peach blossoms that are the flower of Tet, the Vietnamese New Year, in the north. The young also read.  At the Hanoi-Hue-Saigon bookstore, the city's largest, a clerk in the section marked Literature reported that her biggest sellers were romantic novels and detective stories.  She said a favorite among the books, which were priced inexpensively from a few cents to about half a dollar at street exchange rates, was ''Romeo, Juliet and Darkness,'' a love story by an author named Jan Otsenasech set against the evil of Nazi Germany. ''A lot of books come from the Russians,'' an English- speaking browser volunteered.  The store, which had one copy of a Vietnamese translation of Graham Greene's ''The Quiet American,'' also sold collections of contemporary Vietnamese short stories, published locally in pamphlet form on coarse brown paper.  Themes of endless war and remembered heroics mixed with grief mark these stories, which are often short morality lessons. They jolt the foreign reader into an awareness of how ''the American war'' has already slipped back into history, taking its place behind the newest threat from the Chinese. It is overshadowed by universal preoccupations, like the concern of one character that his spoiled, long-haired son will come to no good.  In the collection called ''The Years After,'' the American war becomes a stage set. A story by Nguyen Minh Chau about a militant woman who has to learn love and compassion opens with the line: ''The battalion was installed on an old American base.''  ''The Vietnamese are ambivalent about Americans,'' a Western diplomat said. ''Despite the war, they respond more to American culture than to Russian, and want more contacts with American people.''  Scarce Housing  Housing, which is controlled by the Government, is scarce in Hanoi. Requests by at least one international agency for permission to build apartments at its own expense have met countless bureaucratic obstacles.  The West German Ambassador and his family live in a few rooms of the Thong Nhat Hotel, the rundown ghost of the once-grand Metropole. A Canadian forester on duty with the United Nations has been living there for two years with his wife and three sons. They can be seen trooping into the dining room at lunch and dinner bearing their own mustard and peanut butter to augment the spartan fare.  All diplomatic eyes are on a mysterious green villa, which, by common understanding, seems to be reserved for the American Embassy if and when diplomatic links are forged and the Yankees return.  ''We know it must be for the Americans,'' one diplomat said, ''because the Soviet Embassy is also painted green and we figure that's the superpower color.''

"   , Thailand, Feb. 3   Vietnam's Communist Party leader has acknowledged in a speech marking the party's 55th anniversary that there are ''shortcomings and mistakes'' in Vietnam's economic and ideological affairs, according to reports from the Vietnam News Agency.  The official Hanoi agency, monitored in Bangkok, said the party chief, Le Duan, also told party and Government officials Saturday that the country should improve its relations with China and with the non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia, while continuing to build ties to Moscow.  The speech came at a time when diplomats in Hanoi suggest that a faction of Vietnam's leadership has become wary of the growing dependence on the Soviet Union and would like to keep a line open to Peking.  Relations between the Chinese and Vietnamese - traditional enemies until this century's wars against the French and Americans - have deteriorated again over the last six years, as Peking has given substantial material support to rebels in Cambodia who are trying to overthrow the Vietnamese-installed Government in Phnom Penh.  Reported to Seek Talks  Last week in Bangkok, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the Cambodian rebel coalition, said he had been told in Peking that Vietnam had been seeking talks with China. Along with their disagreement over Cambodia, the Vietnamese and Chinese have been fighting sporadically along their common border.  ''We are prepared to normalize relations with China,'' the Vietnamese party's Secretary General was reported to have said, adding that Hanoi ''firmly believes that the friendship between the two countries will have to be restored.''  Mr. Duan's speech follows a report by Hanoi in December that acknowledged a failure to meet nearly all the country's economic targets for 1984. Vietnam and its allies, Laos and Cambodia, are among Asia's poorest nations.  Diplomats in Hanoi say there appear to be continuing disagreements in the Hanoi leadership on recent experiments in liberalized economic policies, not unlike China's moves toward a pragmatic, less ideological approach.  In the speech, Mr. Duan seemed to be, as he has been before, on the side of liberalized changes. He was reported to have said ''dynamic and flexible management'' was the way to ''high productivity.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 4 1985 ,11

"   , Thailand, Feb. 22   American military officers indicated today that it would take at least a month to begin identifying remains found at a site in Laos where an American gunship crashed during the Vietnam War.  At the same time, they praised Laos for its ''extreme cooperation'' in assisting in the search.  The Laotian-American excavation took place last week at a site near Pakse, in eastern Laos, where an American C-130 went down in December 1972 with 16 servicemen aboard. Two survived the crash, one body was found, and 13 men have been reported missing in action.  ''There was a midair explosion at 7,500 feet,'' Lieut. Col. Joe Harvey, said of the plane, which was struck by antiaricraft fire. ''One wing came off. It went into a steep dive. When it crashed, a large amount of ordnance exploded. The plane burned for two days. Identities will be very difficult to establish.''  ''We recovered everthing that could be recovered,'' Maj. Johnie E. Webb, head of the Central Identification Center in Honolulu, said at a news conference today.  Both he and Colonel Harvey indicated that it would take at least a month to begin the identifications. The remains and personal possessions are being taken to Honolulu for examination.  Major Webb described the crash site as ''covered with undergrowth five to six feet tall.''  Praising the ''extreme cooperation'' of the Laotian military authorities who searched with the Americans, he said:  ''We cut all the underbrush and removed it. We then formed a skirmish line - all of us on our hands and knees, shoulder to shoulder - to search the ground.''  ''We got everything,'' he said. ''I see no reason to go back.''  The leaders of the operation, the first joint American-Indochinese search for Americans lost during the war, returned to Bangkok today. At the news conference, Colonel Harvey, commander of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Honolulu, said he hoped the cooperative effort with Laos ''will lead to an overall improvement in relations.''  Laos, where there is a small American diplomatic mission led by a charge d'affaires, is the first of the three Indochinese Communist nations to allow a joint excavation. Vietnam and Cambodia, with which the United States does not have formal diplomatic relations, have refused to sanction similar explorations.  The United States has listed 2,483 Americans still missing since the Vietnam War, most of them in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. A few are thought to have died or disappeared in Thailand and China, and others were lost over water.  The Reagan Administration has said progress on the search for bodies or information on the whereabouts of the missing Americans is a prerequisite for better relations with Indochinese Communist nations.

"    Representative John McCain, an Arizona Republican serving his second term in Congress, may not be a household name to most Americans but is apparently becoming one in Vietnam.  Mr. McCain, who spent six years in Vietnam as a prisoner of war, visited Hanoi recently along with Walter Cronkite, who is working on a television special to mark the 10th anniversary next month of the fall of Saigon. They dropped by the Hanoi lake into which Mr. McCain tumbled when his Navy plane was shot down in 1967. There they found an impressive monument bearing the likeness of a uniformed American and an inscription in Vietnamese saying that on Oct. 26, 1967, the People's Army had shot down ''the famous air pirate'' John McCain.  While the two men were inspecting the monument, several hundred Vietnamese gathered nearby and began chanting, ''McCain, McCain, McCain.''

The normalization process would begin, he said, with a Vietnamese response to repeated United States requests for information on American soldiers listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War.

"   , Vietnam   A resident ambassador calls it Hanoi's ''simply lovely'' season - the weeks between the stifling months of summer and winter's dismal, bitter chill. The sky is blue, the air fresh, and the streets are full of activity.  In the morning people jog, exercise in parks and squares and seem to dawdle on the way to work. By evening, a magician has appeared on the steps of the Central Bank, where an energetic band has swung into ''Besame Mucho.'' Couples draw closer in the dusk.  ''Streets very bicycle,'' a pedicab driver explains cheerily as he swerves in the twilight to avoid a pedaling teen-ager wearing a T-shirt that says ''Cheech and Chong.'' On a downtown corner, a vendor with several dozen mugs is selling beer from a tub.  This year the change in atmosphere may be more than just seasonal, some longtime residents of the city say. Visitors returning after six months or a year of absence tend to agree.  Lipstick Is Back  There are still bullock carts where other Asian cities would have cars, but there are also more motorbikes, more fashionably dressed young people, and more women in rainbows of soft ao dais, the traditional Vietnamese tunics and trousers that were once seen less frequently among the black pajamas. Lipstick and jewelry are making comebacks.  Some of Hanoi's new look has to do with the city's celebration in September of the 40th anniversary of the declaration of independence from France. Squares were repaved, buildings painted, and a cluster of picturesque but derelict shops around the city's central lake removed to make more room for grass and park benches.  Other changes grow out of new economic policies that appear to be taking into account, at least for the moment, the grumbles of long-suffering consumers.  Many North Vietnamese have gone south over the last decade to have a look at Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, and have come back fascinated by its looser and more prosperous-looking way of life. Is the Grass Greener in China?  A lot of people, diplomats say, also have an eye on China's ''modernizations.'' Foreign visitors are often asked for details about developments there, and whether life has improved as much as they have heard.  In one of those chance encounters that seem more frequent in Hanoi these days, a senior army officer in uniform struck up a conversation in French with a visitor in a city park. After talking a little about his relatives in Texas and California, he suddenly began to muse about his impending retirement and how, after nearly 40 years in the army - he joined at the age of 17 to fight the French - he could look forward to only more hardship in old age.  ''There is never enough food,'' he said, patting his lean rib cage. ''We live five in one room, and there is no peace. Something is wrong with our economy.''  The runaway hit of the theatrical season is ''Me and Us,'' a satire on petty-minded bureaucrats who get in the way of progress. Tickets, like everything else, are for sale on the black market, and there are reports that the company is looking for a bigger theater.  The play, by Luu Quang Yu, got by the censors, the knowledgeable say, because it is essentially in line with criticisms made by Hanoi's economic pragmatists, who have been in the ascendancy since a party meeting in June.  The play, which originated in Ho Chi Minh City (where it won an award) and has been televised nationally, ridicules the sycophancy of party officials, make-work jobs, endless political meetings and ritualistic jargon.  Audiences seem to empathize with the tragic hero who is clobbered by the system for showing initiative. As a line in the play puts it: he was ''wrong to be right too soon.''  It is a lively season in literature, too, with the most popular books said to be stories of life in the countryside, where the successful policies of the pragmatists coexist with unpopular political drives to collectivize.  A reporter asked a Vietnamese official to describe a particular book that is making the rounds among Vietnamese in Bangkok.  ''It's about how everything goes wrong,'' he said with a wan smile.  There is a building boom of sorts in progress in Hanoi. A diplomat said it was a result of the Government's decision to loosen controls over construction materials, and release bricks and other long absent items for private purchase. On several streets piles of waiting bricks and cement were destined to become restaurants, workers said. In the countryside, farmers build bigger houses.  The freeing of construction materials came at about the time the central Government decided to make some drastic changes in the way its employees, a large percentage of the work force in this srictly controlled Communist economy, were paid. Ration coupons to be exchanged for goods were abolished and wages at least theoretically increased.  Civil servants are sometimes wary of new policies and divided about whether they will work. Several said they now had more money to spend and valued the greater freedom of choice in making purchases. Others said they did not expect significant improvement in their lives.  ''We still all have to have two jobs,'' a Government interpreter said.  A young Vietnamese woman from Europe, back for the first time in more than 12 years to visit her elderly father, said she was saddened that life was no easier than it had been in wartime.  ''My country is beautiful,'' she said. ''But the people have no time to look at beautiful things.''  Having a foreign connection is becoming as much an asset in Hanoi as it has long been in the south, where relatives abroad supply many luxuries and sometimes the necessities of life.  In Hanoi some commodities that find their way to market stalls are from the Soviet-bloc countries, where young people go to work or study.  Vietnamese laugh at Western reports that they are sent there as forced labor to repay the country's mammoth debts to Moscow and its allies. On the contrary, they say, so popular are the work assignments that people pay bribes to get them. Going to Poland or Czechoslovakia can mean a down jacket or tape deck at the very least.  More Western goods are also finding their way here from Thailand, Japan, Europe and the United States.  In an embroidery shop, where a visitor startled the sales staff by saying she had come to buy a blouse, not change money - the real business of most private traders, it seems - stylish dresses made of American fabric were produced from a back room. So were T-shirts embroidered with American cartoon characters.  The shop manager, spurred by the customer's comments on the high quality of the work, plunged into a display cabinet, scattering bits of cloth, and emerged with a pile of fashion catalogues from Frankfurt, Stockholm and Los Angeles.  ''Everything comes from the West or Hong Kong,'' he said. ''Many Russian ladies shop here.''  Sometimes Hanoi's two societies, the secretive Government and the curious people, intersect jarringly for a brief second. One recent morning, a bicyclist pulled up alongside two Americans in ''cyclo'' pedicabs and began the litany of ''where from'':  Russia? Sweden? Germany? America! ''I used to teach physics in Newark, New Jersey,'' he said in English. ''I came home in 1971,'' he added, doffing a smart straw hat as he cruised along.  He had begun drifting animatedly into reminiscences of New York, when he suddenly halted in mid-sentence and pedaled off, his face without expression and his eyes straight ahead as if he had never seen the strangers.  Beneath the next shade tree was a policeman.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Hanoi residents (NYT/Barbara Crossette)                      ",November 1 1985 ,11

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   Do Hoang Hai says that when he was a South Vietnamese student activist in the 1960's he specialized in leading attacks against the United States Embassy in Saigon. But today, Saigon has become Ho Chi Minh City, and Mr. Hai, the deputy director of its Import-Export Corporation, works to bring American trade and investment back to Vietnam.  A decade after North Vietnamese troops unified the country, and despite years of Soviet assistance, Vietnam is a poor nation in need of hard-currency trade and Western aid, diplomats in the region say. If Washington were to lead the way, they add, other industrialized nations would follow. But how is Hanoi to deal with Washington?  In the first place, the United States wants Vietnam out of Cambodia, which it has occupied since December 1978. Though the United Nations General Assembly approved again last week, by the largest margin in seven years, a call for the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces, most diplomats doubt that Hanoi can be moved from that strategic buffer nation. Diplomats and international agency officials close to the Vietnamese believe, however, that Hanoi has decided to try to remove some of the more negotiable obstacles to diplomatic ties and better feelings. These include requests for a more credible accounting of missing Americans, release of Amerasian children who want to leave and the reopening of discussions on a Reagan Administration offer to resettle the inmates of political prison camps.  However, things are not going well with Washington, and this seems to puzzle the Vietnamese. Visitors sometimes come away with the sense that many Vietnamese, living on the rhetoric of the 1960's, are unaware how much the world - and America - have changed, how much sympathy for them has disappeared in the gap between the Chicago Seven and Rambo. Or it may be a matter of a proud people being unwilling to alter its tactics.  Mr. Hai, asks American reporters for ''the same understanding we got from the media during the war.'' Young people, raised to believe that a peasant army ''defeated the greatest, most sophisticated military power,'' cannot understand why Hanoi has become a pariah at the United Nations and lost old friends among developing nations. They cannot fathom why American guilt has not been translated into help with rebuilding.  The conflict between pressing economic realities and the suspicion directed at Washington make this a critical time. Diplomats and aid officials are watching the exploratory talks between Vietnamese and Americans, as well as concurrent Vietnamese overtures to China, for signs of a new willingness to be accomodating.  There has been progress, albeit slow, on the missing Americans. The first joint excavation of a wartime plane crash site, tentatively promised for March, is now to be held this month. Meetings get postponed without explanation; one is now scheduled for Wednesday.  Hanoi continues to ask that thousands of Amerasian children now reaching maturity be taken away.  But it seems cool to approaches by nongovernmental Americans. ''It's about time the Vietnamese demonstrated some good will,'' said Charles Printz of Human Rights Advocates International, after Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach offered to deal with private American groups. Mr. Printz said that his organization of 300 lawyers had offered to help devise a legal way of moving the children but that its letters to Hanoi had gone unanswered. Offers of assistance from American religious groups are also declined. Asked why the Mennonite Central Committee, which works in Cambodia, has been rebuffed, a Foreign Ministry official said Vietnam did not need the programs.  Hopes are also dim for the resettlement of inmates from what Hanoi once called ''re-education'' camps.  Vietnam first offered to allow the estimated 8,000 to 10,000 prisoners to emigrate, then backed off when Washington sought to negotiate procedures. Recently in Geneva, the United States again asked Vietnam to allow the prisoners to go.  Hanoi is widely believed to be holding out for diplomatic ties before freeing the detainees. A delegation of Vietnam veterans from New York State, led by two state assemblymen, recently asked if this were so.

"   , Thailand, Nov. 13   American military officials arrived in Hanoi today to discuss the fate of American servicemen listed as missing in action in Vietnam and to excavate the crash site of a B-52 bomber in the first such joint effort of the United States and Vietnam.  The excavation at the site of the crash in 1972 will begin Monday, but will be preceded by talks aimed at locating other areas where remains of Americans may be found.  A total of 2,441 Americans are listed as misssing in action in Indochina, 1,797 of them in Vietnam and surrounding waters. Vietnam has turned over the remains of only 123 American servicemen since 1974, drawing strong criticism from United States officials.  The American delegation in Hanoi for three days of technical talks is expected to seek the quick return of the remains of seven people, believed to be Americans, which were recovered earlier by Vietnam.

"   , Vietnam, Nov. 16   Vietnam asked the United States today to send a high-level delegation to Hanoi to finish details of the two-year Vietnamese plan to account for missing Americans. It also announced that it would soon return the remains of seven Americans.  ''We should have that meeting as soon as possible to facilitate the implementation of the two-year plan,'' said Tran Hoan, head of the North American desk at the Foreign Ministry.  Mr. Hoan spoke three days before the start of the first joint United States-Vietnamese excavation of remains. He said the effort to search farmland where a B-52 bomber crashed near Hanoi would serve to ''put an end to the things of the past and to turn a new page in relations.''  Mr. Hoan also said Vietnam would return the remains of seven more missing Americans immediately after the completion of excavation.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",November 17 1985 ,11

"    THUONG, Vietnam, Nov. 20   United States and Vietnamese workers found more pieces of metal and fabric-like material today from an American airplane that the Vietnamese Government says is a B-52 that crashed in a rural garden 13 years ago. Human bone fragments were found earlier, but it was not yet determined whether they were the remains of American airmen.  The Vietnamese have reported that an American bomber with four airmen aboard crashed after it was struck by missiles in December 1972.  However, American military experts at the site, nine miles from Hanoi, said they could not yet draw any firm conclusions from the bone fragments or determine whether the plane was a B-52.  The excavation, by 10 Vietnamese and 12 Americans, is the first joint effort to account for the 1,797 Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam war.

The excavation will continue today and is scheduled to conclude next Friday, she said.

"      The United States and Vietnam will hold talks on the highest level in nine years next Monday in Hanoi, the State Department announced today.  The purpose of the meeting is to lay the groundwork for resolving the problem of the nearly 1,800 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam.  Charles E. Redman, a department spokesman, said the United States hoped to build on ''the significant increase'' in cooperation that has become apparent.  The American team will be headed by Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, and by Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Others in the group are Richard Childress, political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff at the White House, and Anne Mills Griffiths, executive director of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. To Meet With Foreign Minister They will confer with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and with a Deputy Foreign Minister, Hoang Bich Son, Mr. Redman said.  This is the latest in a series of recent moves toward tackling the emotionally charged issue of the Americans still not unaccounted for from the war. It is the highest-level American delegation to visit Vietnam since Leonard Woodcock, then the president of the United Auto Workers, visited Hanoi in 1977 on behalf of President Jimmy Carter, to discuss normalization of relations.  The United States lists 1,797 Americans as unaccounted for in Vietnam, 700 in the north and 1,097 in the south. In addition, 556 are listed as unaccounted for in Laos, 82 in Cambodia, and 6 in China, for a total of 2,441.  Of this total, half are listed on a roll of killed in action, but bodies not recovered. The other half is on the list of prisoners of war and missing in action, but the Pentagon regards all but one of them as legally dead.  The one American still regarded legally as missing or captured, is Col. Charles Shelton, an Air Force pilot, who is known to have been captured in Laos by Pathet Lao forces on April 29, 1965, a Pentagon spokesman said today. He is listed as missing or captured ''symbolically,'' the spokesman said, to demonstrate American interest in the issue.  Since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, the United States has received over 800 reports of first-hand sightings of people who are possibly Americans in Indochina. The Pentagon, in a news release last month, said most of these cases had been resolved as either fabrications or involving Americans who had returned to the United States.  But 119 cases are still under investigation,'' it said.  Of these 119, there are 28 from North Vietnam, 74 from South Vietnam, 15 from Laos and 2 from Cambodia.  Until the issue is resolved, the United States Government takes the position that ''although we have been thus far been unable to prove that Americans are still detained against their will, the information available to us precludes ruling out that possibility.''  The United States has made this a priority issue before there can be discussion about the establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam. The United States has also said that Vietnam would have to agree to a formula for withdrawing its 160,000 troops from Cambodia and allowing open elections there.  High-Level Talks Proposed  Vietnam said in July that it wanted the issue of the missing American resolved once and for all within two years.  It proposed high-level talks to discuss ways of dealing with the problem. The United States agreed and originally scheduled the Armitage-Wolfowitz mission for Aug. 23. But when Foreign Minister Thach said he had to go to Moscow on that date, only Mr. Childress and Mrs. Griffiths went to Hanoi.  After that visit, the State Department said Sept. 3 that the discussions had been ''the most positive'' to date.  There have since been follow-up talks between Mr. Childress and Vietnamese officials at the United Nations. And last month, a joint United States-Vietnam team searched for remains of Americans in a rural area six miles north of Hanoi where a B-52 bomber crashed in December 1972. That effort ended Dec. 1, with only slim hopes of identifying American servicemen from the unearthed bone fragments. Information About Crash Sites State Department officials said the United States had information about the sites of plane crashes and locations where Americans were seen being taken prisoner, and that increased efforts could make headway in clearing up many cases.  The Vietnamese have been handing over remains over the years. So far, 130 remains identified as Americans have been turned over since 1974, 17 from Laos, and 2 from Cambodia. There is a persistent belief, based on what is said to be plausible information from a Vietnamese refugee, that the remains of several hundred Americans are stored in a Hanoi warehouse mortuary. This has been denied by Vietnam.  In a related matter, the State Department announced that Laos had authorized a team of American technical specialists to examine a site where an Air Force AC-130 gunship crashed during the Vietnam war. A similar team was able to recover the remains of 13 Americans in an excavation last February.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 30 1985 ,11
"      An Army laboratory has identified the remains of six American servicemen killed in the Vietnam War, the Pentagon announced today.  The identifications were made over the past month at the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, Hawaii, after the of the remains were returned on March 20 to United States officials in Hanoi, said Michael I. Burch, a Pentagon spokesman.  Four of the six men identified were Air Force officers who were shot down in their aircraft over North Vietnam and later listed as missing in action. The others, an Army officer and a Marine Corps officer, were listed as prisoners of war who were known to have died after being captured, the Pentagon said.  The Pentagon identified the remains as belonging to these men:  Col. Melvin J. Killian of the Air Force, from Council Bluffs, Iowa, reported lost over North Vietnam on Sept. 30, 1965.  Maj. Cleveland S. Harris of the Air Force, from Birmingham, Ala., reported lost over North Vietnam on Feb. 29, 1968.  Maj. Chambliss M. Chesnutt of the Air Force, from Little Rock, Ark., reported lost over North Vietnam on Sept. 30, 1965.  Capt. Michael D. Chwan of the Air Force, from Bayonne, N.J., reported lost over North Vietnam Sept. 30, 1965.  Sgt. Gerasimo Arroyo-Baez of the Army, from Maunabo, P.R., reported as captured in South Vietnam on March 24, 1969, and later dying in captivity.  Sgt. Robert C. Sherman of the Marine Corps, from Danville, Ill., reported as captured in South Vietnam on June 24, 1967, and later dying in captivity.  Maj. Keith Schneider, an Army spokesman, said there were 35 other men listed as dying in captivity in South Vietnam whose remains had not been recovered.  Remains to Arrive on CoastIn releasing the names, the Pentagon said the six bodies would be transported by plane from Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii to California on Wednesday.  ''We appreciate this return of remains, and combined with the recent Vietnamese agreement to hold a minimum of six technical meetings per year, we hope it marks the beginning of the fulfillment of the Vietnamese pledges to accelerate their search efforts,'' the Pentagon said. It added the next meeting to discuss the return of additional bodies would be held April 17-20 in Hanoi.  Vietnam last returned the remains of eight people to the United States in July 1984. Six were later identified as Americans.  According to the Pentagon, before the latest identifications were made 2,483 Americans were listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia as a result of the Vietnam War. Hanoi has maintained it is not holding any American prisoners.  Since 1974 Hanoi has returned the remains of 93 Americans lost in Vietnam and in Laos. The remains of four others have not been identified as Americans.  1  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 9 1985 ,11

"   , Md.   Donald Shay's father is retired now. Donald's little sister has two young children of her own. His fiancee finally married someone else. And Donald's mother doesn't bake his favorite apple pie much anymore; the good smell brings back too many bad memories.  Mr. Shay doesn't know any of this. And he may never know. In fact, his family may never know where he is, or where he was when he died, if he died. For Mr. Shay is one of 2,477 Americans still missing in action from the Vietnam War.  Ten years after the fall of Saigon and 15 years after that smiling, 24-year-old lacrosse player flew off a radar screen into his family's memory somewhere over Indochina, no one knows for sure what happened to any of the missing Americans.    More Than Mere Statistics  But in one of the more mysterious legacies of that painful era in American history, these men who went off to war as individuals have now become, as a group, much more than simply a sad statistic. They are the subject of movies, books and songs, the object of angry demonstrations, earnest petitions and solemn vigils, the focus of intense Presidential interest, microscopic analysis and secret satellite photography and the heart of some delicate diplomatic exchanges trying to bridge broad cultural chasms.  The alleged remains of some missing men, reduced to bones and fragments after years in the jungle, have even become the currency of a ghoulish, clandestine commerce that preys on the hopes and fears of families and refugees.  ''Somehow,'' said one United States Government official, ''the mystery of their disappearance and their deaths have taken on a peculiar life of their own.''  For military records, all but one of the missing are officially presumed dead, ending the pay, automatic promotion and service benefits accruing for years. Only the case of a single missing flier remains active for symbolic reasons. But for diplomatic records, the missing remain a live issue, a major obstacle to the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States and a lever for some Southeast Asian lands to keep the United States in the region as a political counterbalance.  For some family members, the missing relative is dead, a sad part of a slowly fading past that might somehow still miraculously reappear and complicate a brand new life. Other relatives still wait, in hope that their loved one might walk back through the door some day, perhaps tomorrow.  For the children of the missing, many of them not so childish anymore, the absent father is often but a dim memory, kept alive on den walls or treasured tape cassettes by sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers or wives, some of them remarried, some of them happy now, some of them troubled, all of them scarred.  ''It's been such a long time to be uncertain,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, whose brother vanished in Vietnam nearly two decades ago. ''You want to be realistic. But you're afraid to give up hope.''  By the standards of war, America's 2,477 Vietnam missing are few, thanks to modern recovery methods, the nature of land fighting and new forensic technology that enables investigators to identify even partial remains by, for instance, electronically reconstructing a skull from a fragment.    Tallies of the Missing  The Center for Military History still lists 3,350 missing in action from World War I, 8,177 in Korea, where M.I.A. teams still mount occasional search excavations, and 78,777 from World War II, when many were lost at sea.  Of the Vietnam missing, 706 were in the Army, 937 in the Air Force, 500 in the Navy, 291 in the Marine Corps and 1 in the Coast Guard. The other 42 were civilians. Of the missing, 1,101 disappeared in or over South Vietnam, 719 in North Vietnam, 569 in Laos, 82 in Cambodia and 6 over China.  Privately, American officials and relatives admit there is little hope of accounting for many of the missing, perhaps even a majority, and most likely for all those who disappeared in Cambodia, the scene of almost continuous fighting since.  In addition, 1,186 of the total missing are really listed as Killed in Action- Body Not Recovered. These are, for instance, pilots whose planes were seen to crash with no parachutes or soldiers who were killed on patrol under circumstances in which comrades could not retrieve the body.  An unknown number will never be found because there are no remains to find. Last year when members of Congress pressured Lieut. Gen. James A. Williams, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to tell them how many realistically might be found, he testified: ''Some of these people have disappeared by being completely obliterated. If you have ever watched an explosion disintegrate somebody, you would understand that that happens.''  A Lower Priority  A full accounting of both prisoners of war and missing was part of the 1973 Paris accords that arranged United States disengagement from the Vietnam conflict, where 58,022 Americans died. North Vietnam returned 591 prisoners in 1973, and another 134 returned or escaped at other times. But with the American withdrawal and the fall of Saigon 10 years ago this month, the missing got a lower priority by a Government and public eager to put the divisive war behind. Few remains were returned; 102 since 1973, including two non-Americans.  Two commissions reported to President Carter that there were no live American prisoners remaining in Indochina. And each military service moved administratively to declare all the missing dead.  What happened in 1980 was the election as President of Ronald Reagan, who as Governor of California spoke out often and emotionally for the need of a full accounting. He was photographed wearing one of the M.I.A. bracelets engraved with the name of a missing man and sold in the war to show symbolic support. The President still keeps five M.I.A. bracelets hanging in his study next to the Oval Office.  ''The way our system of government works,'' said one aide, ''if the President is personally interested in something, then the Government is interested in it. And Mr. and Mrs. Reagan are personally very interested in M.I.A.'s.''  New Place on Agenda  In the past four years this interest, displayed through numerous speeches and public references, through many private telephone calls and letters to M.I.A. families and through countless Reagan Administration meetings and a still-secret 10-point National Security Council strategy, has raised the subject to what the President calls ''the highest national priority.''  It has also left few Government officials willing to question the campaign or to be quoted by name. ''Few people in the Vatican,'' said one, ''would tell the Pope they question the faith.''  The broad public and private strategy has involved efforts to mobilize the Government's bureaucracy, the intelligence community and bipartisan political support to transmit a convincing signal to Hanoi that an accounting is necessary before any aid or normalizing of relations.  The President got an unusual security clearance for Mrs. Griffiths, the executive director of the National League of M.I.A.-P.O.W. Families. She now routinely attends relevant meetings of the National Security Council as well as diplomatic negotiations in New York and Hanoi.  One result has been to dissipate the harsh criticism the league has aimed at previous ''do-nothing'' Administrations. ''For a while,'' said Mrs. Griffiths, a Californian whose organization says it has 3,000 M.I.A. family members and 15,000 concerned people as supporters, ''our families felt they were fighting their own Government as well as the Vietnamese.''  But another result, tied in with a growing public willingness to address the emotional legacies of the war, has been the eager involvement of a variety of groups and individuals who profess patriotism but have at times complicated diplomatic efforts. ''It's a very thin line,'' said one Administration strategist.  Veterans Groups' Actions  Veterans groups have helped gather millions of petition signatures demanding accountings of the missing from the Vietnamese, and they recently provided the Hanoi Government with details on some unmarked burial sites of its missing. One small group has staged a round-the-clock vigil at the Vietnam Memorial since Dec. 24, 1982.  Others, however, have burned Vietnamese flags before that country's mission to the United Nations, while some groups raise money from Americans to mount ''rescue raids,'' which produced no verifiable results and complicated official talks.  What seems to capture the public imagination on the missing is the lingering uncertainty about their fate and, in the view of some, a wishful willingness to believe any scrap of information and to distrust any Vietnamese denials about remaining prisoners of war.  ''We have returned everyone,'' Le Kim Chung, Vietnam's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said in an interview. ''Also, why would we want to keep them? We have enough troubles without keeping Americans.''  Mr. Le also denounced as fabrications refugee reports of caches of American remains. One Vietnamese undertaker who fled to the United States told Congress he saw 400 such remains in a Hanoi warehouse, which many in Washington believe.  Sightings of Whites  What has proven most tantalizing to M.I.A. families and the 18 Defense Intelligence Agency analysts assigned full time to sifting data about the missing are reports of ''live sightings,'' usually from refugees, of a white in Indochina in a particular place on a particular date. According to Col. Gerald S. Venanzi, a former prisoner of war who is the Pentagon's senior authority on the missing, there have been more than 750 reported sightings since 1973, some of prisoners and some of men free of visible restraints.  All refugee camps have multilingual posters seeking information about the missing. Those responding are interviewed by special teams, sometimes using polygraphs, or lie detectors. ''We have him describe his village, his house, where he saw the Caucasian,'' said one intelligence official who sought anonymity. ''With computers we can cross-check his identity with other refugees from the same village. And with satellites we can photograph the place right down to the fence in his yard.''  Analysts believe some stories are fabrications planted by Vietnamese to discredit refugee reports and consume valuable tracking resources. Other reports turn out to be Europeans or stem from refugees seeking favorable immigration treatment. There is no pattern to the sightings, but 175 such reports remain unresolved, prompting officials to say they cannot rule out the possibility some prisoners remain.  Should live Americans be found, officials said, the President has authorized any means necessary to extricate them. ''This could range from diplomacy to black helicopters in the night,'' said one official.  'Maybe He's Better Dead'  Edna Hicks clings to such reports as proof that her son Terrin, a 31-year-old pilot when his plane was downed over North Vietnam in 1968, could be alive. ''It'd be a miracle, a long shot, I know,'' said Mrs. Hicks, now 70 years old, who sometimes still speaks of her son in the present tense. ''Some days you feel he's alive. Some days not. And then you think, what would he be like after 17 years of imprisonment and torture? Maybe he's better dead.''  To some, the inability of such vast intelligence capabilities to confirm the existence of a live American prisoner is proof that none exist and suggests the Administration is using rhetoric to fuel false hopes.  The Administration's known interest is also fueling a brisk border business in bones, as refugees, resistance forces and others appear, usually in Thailand, with plastic bags purportedly containing American remains, some of which are really animal bones. Various forms of military identification have also been offered, some belonging to American soldiers long since safely home.  That is how Nicholas Brooks of Newburgh, N.Y., finally came home 12 years after parachuting from his stricken plane over Laos. His remains were delivered to Bangkok by a Lao resistance member and identified at a special military laboratory in a concrete-block warehouse in Honolulu. Technicians there can determine age, sex, race, blood type and basic stature even from partial remains. Physical characteristics such as height, weight, broken bones and dental records for all the missing have been computerized.  Using other Asian governments and the United Nations for pressure, the Reagan Administration continues negotiations for the return of M.I.A.'s from Laos, where a joint excavation team recovered remains from an American crash site in February, and from Vietnam, which turned over the remains of six others in March.  Outlook Seems to Improve  Detailed files for each man, concentrating on cases believed most physically accessible, are turned over to Vietnamese at meetings in a sparsely furnished Foreign Ministry room in Hanoi. The Vietnamese, citing humanitarian reasons and saying families of the missing are victims of the war like themselves, recently agreed to increase these sessions to a minimum of six a year. Both sides say they detect increasing cooperation. One United Nations official called it ''a definite defrosting'' of the M.I.A. issue with a ''mounting momentum'' that also affords Vietnam a window from its diplomatic isolation.  In regular visits to Hanoi and quiet dinners in New York, American officials seek to quicken the pace of returns, calling it ''good-will money in the bank'' for future Vietnamese- American relations.  Mr. Le says the process will take time, that Vietnam has 300,000 missing of its own, that it lacks recovery resources and that a proper American attitude would speed things. He cites as ''unhelpful'' and Reagan aides describe as ''unnecessary'' a recent House rider to provide $5 million in arms for Cambodian rebels fighting Vietnamese forces. Mr. Le said diplomatic relations, as the United States has with Laos, would be necessary for joint excavations.  The United States is known to have suggested instead that American experts survey crash and burial sites for an excavation estimate, which the Administration will pay.  ''The war is over,'' said Mr. Le. ''We want to look straight ahead to the future and a new chapter in relations between our two countries.''  Donald Shay's mother here, Sara Frances, does not like to talk about the Vietnamese authorities. For a while she wrote many foreign governments, even Laotian royalty, about her missing son, and she went to Thailand. She also immersed herself in M.I.A. league work.  Donald was home on leave in the summer of 1970 when he proposed to Jane Morris, a stewardess. They had met in college. They agreed to marry in December at the end of his photo- reconnaissance tour in Thailand.  In a conversation the next day in the Shay family's backyard on Hilltop Road under the big maple tree that had grown up with the Shay youngsters, Donald Shay's sister, now Mary Louisa Rutledge, suggested that the couple marry immediately during the leave.  Prospects of Widowhood  ''As if he could see into the future,'' Lieutenant Shay's sister recalled the other day, ''he said: 'No, we'll wait till I get back. I'd never want to make her a widow.' ''  Four months later, one month before his combat tour was to end, Donald Shay disappeared. The engagement ring arrived in the mail a few days later. Eighteen months ago Janet Morris married someone else. ''I have my own son now,'' she said, ''and I know how a mother feels.''  For several years Dr. and Mrs. Shay held out strong hopes for their only son's return. The optimism has faded. ''I no longer think I'm going to hear from him tomorrow,'' said Mrs. Shay, who still wears her son's M.I.A. bracelet. ''But I won't accept that he's dead until I hear something definitive.''  Mrs. Shay's daughter, an opponent of the war, gave up hope for her brother sooner. ''The uncertainty was like ripping off a big bandage every day,'' she said. And so the other day when her 6-year-old son, Donald, pointed at his uncle's photo in the den and asked who it was, Mrs. Rutledge didn't say anything about M.I.A.'s or P.O.W.'s or Government negotiations or radar screens. ''That's Mommy's brother,'' she said. ''He's not living anymore.''

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 30   The sun had just risen behind the twin-spired city cathedral today when high-stepping troops and rumbling Soviet tanks began their parade down the Street of April 30 to mark a decade of Communism in what was once known as the Republic of South Vietnam.  The procession started almost exactly at 7:52 A.M., the hour 10 years ago when a helicopter carrying the last American and South Vietnamese evacuees rose from the roof of the United States Embassy when this city was called Saigon.  Today, as jets flew overhead and the ranks of soldiers, sailors, militiawomen, militiamen, factory workers and students passed by, the scene at first suggested a strictly Kremlin-inspired occasion. Nine members of the ruling Politburo, including Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and Le Duan, the Communist Party leader, sat on the reviewing stand among military officers and foreign Communist or fraternal delegations.  But then a local band on the sidelines broke into Vietnamese rock and down the street came roller skaters and a motorcycle club, strutting children and a small sea of women in the brightly colored traditional tunics called ao dais.  ''We don't have this kind of parade in Hanoi,'' a Government official here for the occasion remarked. ''This is South Vietnamese.''  For Ho Chi Minh City, as it is now known,the 10th anniversary of its fall to North Vietnam has also provided an occasion to celebrate itself. Floats bore the industrial and agricultural products of the South as well as reminders of its culture. A few Buddhist monks and Roman Catholic priests sat in the reviewing stand as honored guests.  The anniversary has also given the city the chance to outline the future of its metropolitan area of 3.5 million people, where the spirit of free enterprise, encouraged during the ''American'' years has not been subdued.  Finally, the event has allowed outsiders in this very secretive country glimpses into the security measures taken in the sometimes recalcitrant South, where dozens of people have recently been tried, and several executed, for subversion.   Crowds Large but Quiet  Crowds were large but quiet today around the reviewing stands near the former presidential palace. City officials said the audience included 50,000 ''organized watchers'' brought in by local party committees.  They said they had no reliable estimate of how many others had come on their own. The ranks were swelled by hundreds of street urchins looking for something exciting to watch while doing a little panhandling on the side.  It was difficult to judge reactions. There were no cheers or applause except from the invited guests. A man in the crowd who talked with a Western reporter was hauled off by the police. Contact with foreigners is against the law.  Few Americans accepted Hanoi's invitation to attend the celebrations this week as friends of the country. David Dellinger, one of the Chicago Seven who demonstrated outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention, is here. So is John McAuliff, the head of the Indochina Reconciliation Project, a program of the American Friends Service Committee that campaigns for improved ties between Hanoi and Washington.  Antiwar Activists Absent  Jane Fonda, the actress, Cora Weiss, a peace activist, and the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, pastor of the Riverside Church in Manhattan, who were all prominent antiwar activists, were reported to have turned down invitations.  The more than 150 Western reporters, most of them American, here attract great interest but no apparent hostility from residents. The journalists' reasons for coming baffle some residents. ''Why would you want to come for the anniversary of an occupation?'' an elderly shopowner asked a reporter.  Conversations with Government officials and city residents who were willing to talk indicate that the unfinished business of absorbing the private businesses of Ho Chi Minh City into the Socialist state will dominate local efforts for some time to come.  Mai Chi Tho, who as chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City Peoples Committee functions as the Mayor, said in a news conference Sunday that the local government's main objective was to turn the city from a consumer society spoiled by the false economy of the past to a producer society contributing in very large part to the development of the country. Vietnam is one of the world's poorest nations.  Very Gradual Change  Within that context, he said, family businesses remain important, at least during the transition period, which he said would likely go on until the year 2000. After that, Mr. Tho said collectivization of production, technology and culture, would be completed.  Local shopkeepers say they are under great pressure to turn over their businesses to the state. One shopowner said a new round of takeovers was coming next month and that his family had only a few weeks to decide what to do. Refusing a partnership with Government means unemployment, the shopkeeper said. He said his family would leave the country if it did not have members still in prison camps.  Reporters here heard frequent complaints that it seems economically unsound to continue to squeeze local private enterprise, which has given this city considerably more vitality than Hanoi appears to have. Asked about this concern, a Government official gave the often-heard reply: ''Transforming the South into a Socialist society will always be our first objective.''  ''Socialism cannot work unless everyone participates,'' Mr. Tho said.  Corruption Remains a Problem  Corruption is said to be worse than ever here, a situation related to economic hardship and common even in more prosperous Asian cities. Two Government employees were executed recently for siphoning and reselling Government gasoline. Such sentences do not seem to deter others, residents say.  Educated professionals, denied the right to work or practice because of their middle-class backgrounds and suspected or real connections to the previous regime, talk about having ''right-'' and ''left-'' hand professions, the one they were trained for, and the one they have to engage in to survive in a city where a cup of coffee can cost two days' pay. The relative abundance of consumer goods indicates the money is found somewhere.  Mr. Tho, 62 years old, a brother of Le Duc Tho and a man often mentioned as a candidate for the next generation of leadership, was candid about the city's problems. Ho Chi Minh City, he said, is short of electricity. There is high unemployment coupled with a population growth rate of 2 percent a year, which will mean five million people in the city by the end of the century.  On the other hand, a paper released by Mr. Tho to coincide with the anniversary listed as achievements by the city the promotion of a climate of ''innovative working methods,'' the ''promotion of small industries,'' particularly traditional handicrafts, and a growth in foreign trade. He says the city is a leader in Vietnam in industry, technology, international communications and culture.  Proud of the Police  Mr. Tho, an internal security expert, is also proud of the city's police. He told reporters Sunday, ''Here we have no demonstrations like you do in the West, and no guerrilla groups like they have in the Philippines, Malaysia or Thailand.''  While Vietnamese offficials and Western diplomats in Hanoi say there is no serious resistence movement operating in the South, surveillance here is said to be intense. A resident said he recently saw 16 longhaired plainclothesmen materialize within seconds to seize a man who was shouting on the street. There are occasional Government admissions and trial records that suggest some dissidence does exist.  On Monday when officials took reporters to meet several ''re-education camp'' inmates north of the city, one of the prisoners said he had been arrested in 1982 for joining a ''counterrevolutionary militia.'' He said he had been forced to join by former officers of the South Vietnamese Army.  A former professional now unemployed in Ho Chi Minh City for refusing to accept ''political direction,'' said that something more widespread than open dissent was ''passive noncooperation'' with Government policies.  ''In this cause of national reconciliation'' an army officer at the city's military command said, ''we know many people are happy, but there are others who are not.'' ---- U.S. to Press Efforts on Missing WASHINGTON, April 30 (UPI) - President Reagan promised stepped-up efforts today to press the countries of Southeast Asia to account for all Americans killed in the Vietnam War.  ''The key to resolution of this issue lies in obtaining the full cooperation of the Governments of Vietnam and Laos,'' Mr. Reagan said in a report to Congress on the 2,477 Americans still missing or unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.  While progress has been made in obtaining fuller cooperation from both countries, Mr. Reagan said, the United States ''should not be regarded in any way as satisfied with the current situation or the progress we have made.''  ''Cooperation has been much too slow,'' he said, ''and we must continue to pursue every possible avenue to reach a level which offers maximum potential for results.''  Mr. Reagan said his Administration had ''vigorously pursued'' a full accounting through high-level visits by American officials to Vietnam and Laos, upgraded intelligence efforts, a campaign to focus public attention on missing soldiers and close coordination with the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.  Among the positive diplomatic steps cited by Mr. Reagan were agreements by Vietnam to increase bilateral meetings on the issue to six from four and to consider the missing Americans separately from other matters.  Vietnam turned over the remains of eight Americans in 1984 and six on March 20 of this year, including - for the first time - two men said by the Vietnamese to have died while being held as prisoners of war.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, May 1   Ten years after the fall of the American-backed Government of South Vietnam, Hanoi's leadership appears divided over how to improve relations with Washington and whether the moment is right to make the effort.  At a news conference today Le Duc Tho, the 74-year-old Politburo member thought to be the most likely successor to the Communist Party Secretary General, Le Duan, took a sharply critical line toward Washington. Criticizing the United States for imposing conditions to the setting up of diplomatic relations and for refusing to allow more cultural and scientific exchanges, Mr. Tho said, ''I can see no possibility of normalization in the immediate future.''  His statements followed comments in an interview last week in Hanoi with Reuters in which Mr. Tho seemed to rule out once and for all the release of prisoners from Vietnamese re-education camps for resettlement in the United States. He said there were 10,000 such prisoners. Government spokesmen here have been giving a figure of 7,000.  On Sunday Le Mai, the 44-year-old Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs who often acts as spokesman for Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, took a more conciliatory line toward Washington in a meeting here with five Western reporters.  'Better Exchange of Views'  ''Contacts between us are more frequent,'' he said. ''We have a better exchange of views and have achieved some kind of mutual understanding.''  Both Mr. Tho and Mr. Mai said the time was right for talks on Cambodia. Mr. Mai said he thought the majority of interested nations now agreed on the outlines of a political solution and that a way had to be found to open discussions on how to bring it about. Both he and Mr. Tho repeated the Vietnamese belief that if there were no talks, the situation would solve itself militarily with no political concessions.  At his news conference today Mr. Tho criticized former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, with whom the Vietnamese leader negotiated the 1973 Paris peace agreement that led to the withdrawal of American troops from South Vietnam. Both men were later jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Mr. Tho said if news reports he had heard were correct, Mr. Kissinger was guilty of ''gross slanders'' about the numbers of political prisoners in Vietnam or the size of casualty figures in the wake of Hanoi's conquest of South Vietnam.  ''Because he smarted under the blow of defeat,'' Mr. Tho said of Mr. Kissinger, ''he is now showing himself as rather aggressive. He is trying to evade the facts.'' [Attempts to reach Mr. Kissinger for reaction, at his home and his office in Washington, were unsuccessful.] Mr. Tho called on the United States to allow more people-to-people exchanges with Vietnam.  ''Over one hundred Americans a year are allowed into Vietnam - military, diplomatic, Congressional, scientific,'' he said. '  From Mr. Mai's perspective exchanges with American delegations have have been fruitful and promising. Mr. Mai, who spent four years on the Vietnamese negotiating team in Paris and has been involved in setting up the Orderly Departure Program, which allows Vietnamese to emigrate legally to the United States, has also been involved in regular discussions on Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War. Meetings on this issue have recently been increased from four to six a year. Last month Hanoi announced that the first joint American-Vietnamese inspection of a wartime crash site would take place in June.  ''There has been quite a lot of progress on M.I.A.'s,'' Mr. Mai said. ''At first our meetings of experts were not very useful but now we are working together better.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 2 1985 ,11
"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, May 2   Somewhere about midway through a week crowded with events to mark the 10th anniversary of the Communist takeover of Saigon, people started noticing the things that were missing.  Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the architect of Vietnam's military defeat of two foreign armies, was not on the reviewing stand at the parade Tuesday, or at any other celebrations in the south. Government officials did not explain why.  Nguyen Thi Binh, the woman who was Foreign Minister of the Provisional Revolutionary Government, the political party of the Vietcong, was due to be present at the opening of a new museum of women's history.  Mrs. Binh did not show up. The museum opening had, in any case, been postponed. There were optimistic responses to requests for interviews with Mrs. Binh, who became familiar to Westerners during the Paris peace talks. But then reporters were told, without elaboration, that Mrs. Binh, now Hanoi's Education Minister, was ''out of the country.'' Explanations were in short supply.  Then there were the missing Russians. After the reception given by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong for invited foreign guests - members of friendship associations in non-Communist countries and fraternal party delegations from the Communist world - Europeans and Americans in attendance reported that if there were any Soviet representatives present they could not be seen among the Cubans and Eastern Europeans.  Many of Vietnam's American friends were absent. Though accounts are conflicting - and there was no official list available - it appears that most of the invited antiwar activists in the United States had sent their regrets. ''Americans have moved on to Nicaragua,'' a European suggested.  On the streets of the city, there were also almost no Amerasian children, the offspring of Vietnamese mothers and American fathers. City officials said they had been sent away so Western visitors would not be annoyed by them.  Some of Ho Chi Minh City's street names were among the missing. An official of the city's press center said that 100 of them had been renamed over the last week to clear away some remaining vestiges of colonialism. On new city maps, there is also a mysterious fading of the ink marking Saigon's famous pagodas and churches, of which there are many in fine condition still used by thousands of Vietnamese.  But the event of the week that may be remembered longest by many journalists for its omissions was a visit to a re-education camp on Monday.  At least 10,000 Vietnamese, whom the Government considers ''war criminals,'' remain in prison camps around the country a decade after the takeover of the south.  Reporters who traveled to the K-4 camp at Xuan Loc, in Long Nai Province, about 50 miles northeast of the city, met two former South Vietnamese Army officers in their early 40's who were being retrained as carpenters. Both Chung Trung Chien and Nguyen Hoang Anh had been rearrested after having served previous sentences. Mr. Chien said he had tried to flee the country. Mr. Anh had joined a ''counterrevolutionary militia'' in 1982.  The prisoners said they were not allowed to describe their living conditions or their daily routines. They had been brought to meet the press near what appeared to be a public park.  Le Nhan, the camp director, said the rules prohibited him from discussing the prisoners' crimes.  He said prisoners could earn from 300 to 2,000 Vietnamese dong a month - $3 to $20 at official exchange rates; or about 90 cents to $6 at black market rates. He said that more than 3,000 former inmates liked the area so much they asked to stay on after release, but that only 100 requests could be granted because of lack of space.  Reporters were never shown the prisoners' quarters, except for a distant glimpse of a dozen or two men playing volleyball and listening to music in a small compound of huts.

"    The party is over in Vietnam, where American networks lent their cameras to a self-serving celebration of Hanoi's only real achievement: conquest. Parades make pictures. What got scant attention was the off-camera horror of Vietnam's unrelenting persecution even of former comrades. Some victims risked their lives by talking to The Times's Barbara Crossette and other reporters. Their story is appalling, their fate a major obstacle to any reconciliation with the United States.  One category of victims is pilloried for middle-class origins, Western education or past involvement with Americans. Ten years after Hanoi's conquest of the South, the regime concedes it still holds 10,000 people in ''re-education'' camps, but the actual number is probably 40,000. Reporters admitted to a special visitors' center were blandly told the prisoners clamor to remain in detention. Then why keep these camps off-limits, and off camera?  A second category of victims is accused of ''backwardness,'' insufficent zeal for Hanoi's Prussian brand of Communism. At least 5,000 are held in five work camps. Also jailed or under house arrest are outspoken Buddhists, Catholics and Protestants. Thich Tri Quang, the Buddhist monk who did so much to discredit former Saigon regimes, is an internal exile; so is Quang Do, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee in 1979.  Similarly consigned to jail or limbo are leaders of the South's Communist Party, whose agitations once swayed American hearts and minds. Their star fell with Saigon. Tran Van Ta, once commander of the Viet Cong forces, has not been seen since 1982. Another leader, Nguyen Thi Binh, was among the few scheduled to take part in victory celebrations. She never turned up, the cryptic explanation being that she was ''out of the country.''  All residents of Ho Chi Minh City live under constant surveillance of neighborhood cadres. The penal system cries out for the United Nations investigation requested by the Vietnam Committee for Human Rights, a Paris-based group. What lends urgency to this plea are signs that Hanoi intends to step up its campaign to eliminate remaining traces of Southern heterodoxy.  The only positive gleam caught by the cameras was the desire of Vietnam's leaders to reach out for American respect. They seem unaware that Hanoi has squandered its moral credit by conquests and oppressions that cannot be attributed to colonialism. When those policies change, so will American feelings about reconciliation.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: EDITORIAL                      ",May 10 1985 ,11
"   , Thailand, June 8   Vietnam's official radio said today that United States hostility ''would only do harm to efforts seeking Americans missing in action'' in the Vietnam War.  The Hanoi radio broadcast said allegations that Vietnam had tortured American captives and forced them to work in labor camps were groundless.  The United States authorities say 2,441 servicemen and 42 civilians are listed as missing in Indochina. Hanoi has repeatedly said that it holds no more American prisoners of war.  President Reagan said Thursday that Vietnam must give the ''fullest possible accounting'' of American missing in action before normalization of United States-Vietnamese relations can be considered.

"    As a young man he wrote love poems. His friends used to borrow them to impress their sweethearts.  But later he fell into what he calls a ''swampland'' of prisons and re-education camps in Vietnam. And as other prisoners might practice yoga to survive, or scratch off the years on filthy walls, Nguyen Chi Thien practiced poetry and scratched his verses in his mind.  According to Amnesty International, International PEN and other rights groups and intellectuals who have taken an interest in his case, the 52-year-old poet, who has spent 23 years in jails and re-education camps since 1958, now lives in old Hoa Lo Prison in Hanoi, the place once known to captured American airmen as the Hanoi Hilton.  Nearly 400 of Mr. Thien's poems, gathered in one volume titled ''Flowers From Hell,'' were brought out of Vietnam in 1979 in manuscript form. The poems, translated into French and English, have since been published in the West; some have been put to music.  Ha Huyen Chi, a Vietnamese poet now living in Washington State, says he believes that Mr. Thien may rank among the leading Vietnamese poets of the century.  Harsh Words About Marx  A typical quatrain, translated by an editor at Yale University named Huynh Sanh Thong, describes the poems themselves:  Flowers from hell - real blood has watered them, blood mixed with animal sweat, with parting tears.  Blooming in prison, sickly, starved and cold, they reek of damp and mold, look gray as mud.  Mr. Thien, a longtime opponent of the Communist Government in Vietnam, is said to have become totally opposed to Communism while being ''re-educated.'' In several poems he assails Marx and Ho Chi Minh - who is regarded in Vietnam as the father of the country - and cries out against what he sees as the hypocrisy of the Government. He shouts against suffering and almost urges revolt.  Six years ago, Mr. Thien managed to get inside the British Embassy in Hanoi with a sheaf of poems like this one, also translated by Mr. Thong:  My poetry's not mere poetry, no, but it's the sound of sobbing from a life, the din of doors in a dark jail, the wheeze of two poor wasted lungs, the thud of earth tossed down to bury dreams, the clank of hoes that dig up memories, the clash of teeth all chattering from cold, the cry of hunger from a stomach wrenching wild, the throb-throb of a heart that grieves, forlorn, the helpless voice before so many wrecks.  All sounds of life half lived, of death half died - no poetry, no.  A Memory for Verse  Tran Nhu, a friend and former fellow prisoner of Mr. Thien, said from his home in Kansas that Mr. Thien was born in Hanoi in June 1933, the youngest of five children. Mr. Thien's father had been an engineer for the French before the victory of the Vietminh in 1954. The family thought of moving south. They got only as far as the port city of Haiphong.  Mr. Thien's friends knew him in the 1940's and 50's as bright, witty, shy with girls and loyal to his friends. He had, they said, an extraordinary memory for verse.  In 1958 Mr. Thien and other young writers in Haiphong decided to start a literary magazine. North Vietmam's leaders had recently inaugurated a Chinese-style ''100 flowers'' campaign and more free expression than usual was in the air. One day Mr. Thien approached Haiphong's cultural officials and asked permission to publish a journal that would be called Vi Dan, or ''For the People.''  But the party's mood had quietly shifted since the campaign had begun. He was told to go home and await a decision. The next day, the police arrived, searched his house and seized his romantic poems. They were used as evidence that Mr. Thien and his friends nurtured ideas that discredited Communism.  He was sentenced to two years' hard labor in Yen Bay Province, north of Hanoi. His camp there - and the camps that followed in the wilder regions of northern Vietnam - became the hell of Mr. Thien's poems.  An 'Underdeveloped Citizen'  Released in early 1961, he joined an amateurish anti-Government group known as Doan Ket, or Union and Solidarity, according to Mr. Nhu, who was also a member. That November, Amnesty reports, Mr. Thien was declared an ''underdeveloped citizen.'' He was sent to re-education camp, released again in September 1964, and sentenced again the following month. He lived in ''the swampland'' for the next 13 years.  On April 2, 1979, during a brief period of freedom, he made a desperate attempt to find a wider audience for his poems. He was living in Haiphong. Having made his mind to send his poems abroad, he went to the British Embassy in Hanoi and handed copies of them to a British diplomat. An accompanying letter, in French, asked ''on behalf of the millions of innocent victims of dictatorship, already fallen or dying a slow and painful death in Communist prisons'' that the poems be published.  The Vietnamese guards arrested Mr. Thien immediately and he has been in prison ever since.  The British diplomat later gave the manuscript of ''Flowers From Hell'' to Patrick J. Honey, a scholar of Vietnamese at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies. Mr. Honey read the poems and decided that although a few seemed coarsely anti-Communist, others were superb and, for Vietnamese verse, unprecedented in their passion.  Photocopies of the poems began circulating in Europe and the United States. They were eventually printed in Vietnamese, and a Vietnamese folksinger in California, Pham Duy, set 20 to music. Two years ago Huynh Sanh Thong at Yale printed ''Flowers From Hell'' with his English translations.  Pierre Emmanuel, a member of the French Academy, and other prominent literary figures have lavished praise on Mr. Thien's verses. Leopold S. Senghor, the former President of Senegal who is also a member of the Academy and a distinguished poet, wrote to Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, last November asking that Mr. Thien be granted amnesty.  Mr. Senghor has not yet received an answer, according to PEN officials. But several weeks after Mr. Senghor's letter went out, Mr. Thien was reportedly transferred from a jailhouse in Haiphong to Hanoi's Hoa Lo Prison.

"    Xuan Thuy, vice chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly and North Vietnam's chief diplomat at the Paris peace talks that led to the withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, died Tuesday in Hanoi, according to a report on Radio Hanoi Wednesday. He was 73 years old.  Although Mr. Thuy has acted as an international spokesman for Vietnam for nearly four decades since its Communist leadership emerged in the 1950's, his most prominent public position was as North Vietnam's chief representative at the Paris peace talks.  For more than four years until the cease-fire agreement was signed Jan. 27, 1973, the slight, smiling man with the cherubic face headed the North Vietnamese negotiating team. Other negotiators described him as articulate, informed, generally affable and a consumate diplomat. He also served as Hanoi's chief deputy in secret negotiations between Henry A. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, the North Vietnamese Politburo member.  Mr. Thuy was born in 1912 in the Ha Dong province of North Vietnam and educated at a French high school in Hanoi. He became involved in nationalist politics while still in his early teens.  Fought French Rule as Teen-Ager  In 1926, when he was 14 years old, he joined Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Youth League. He was arrested by the French for political agitation twice during the 1920's, the first time when he was 16. When he was 18 he was sent to the penal colony on Con Son Island, then known as Poulo Condore, in the South China Sea.  He joined the Indochina Communist Party in 1938. In 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, he was imprisoned at Sonla in northern Vietnam, and was held there for six years during the Japanese occupation. In prison he edited a clandestine Communist newspaper, Suoi Reo.  Mr. Thuy was released from prison in 1945 at the same time as the Viet Minh, the coalition of Communist and nationalist groups that opposed both the French and the Japanese during the war, was taking power from the Japanese occupation forces. He became editor and director of Cuu Quoc, the official newspaper of the Viet Minh.  In 1946 he was elected to the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which the Viet Minh established to resist French rule.  Traveled Abroad in 1950's  Mr. Thuy was sent abroad in 1950, during the war for independence from the French, and in the following years he traveled extensively, visiting Vienna, Stockholm, and Rangoon, Burma, as well as Peking and Moscow. He spoke French and Chinese fluently.  In 1961 and 1962, Mr. Thuy was deputy chairman of the North Vietnamese delegation to the Geneva Conference on Laos. There, facing W. Averell Harriman across the bargaining table, he was described as ''a top-drawer negotiator, a dreadful fellow to face across the table day after day,'' according to an American negotator.  On returning to Hanoi from Geneva, he became Foreign Minister in 1963, but stepped down, ostensibly ''health reasons'' in 1965 after losing a political struggle within the country's leadership when he supported a pro-Moscow line. His replacement, Nguyen Duy Trinh, was regarded as a hard-liner who leaned toward Peking in the Chinese-Soviet ideological struggle.  Mr. Thuy seemed to fall out of favor in Hanoi for several years until returning as a negotiator in the Paris peace talks that began in 1968.  Mr. Thuy was said to have married and had children, but it was not known how many or if they were still alive.

"   , Indonesia, June 29   The United States and Vietnam appear willing to consider opening an American technical office in Hanoi to hasten the process of accounting for American servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, according to statements from both countries.  The Reagan Administration, in a statement issued by the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, made it clear that such a move would depend on a ''significantly'' higher level of Vietnamese cooperation in the search for missing Americans.  The proposal has been discussed with both Hanoi and Washington by Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who has been serving as go-between with Vietnam for the non-Communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations in its efforts to resolve the problem of Cambodia.  In an interview Friday, Mr. Mochtar said that although Washington was reluctant to establish any presence in Hanoi that might be misconstrued as the beginning of diplomatic recognition, the idea of a technical office was ''very much'' alive.  No Need Seen Now  The American statement issued in Bangkok said there appeared to be no necessity at this time for a technical office. But it added:  ''Were circumstances to change, and Vietnam's cooperation to increase significantly in such a way as to require the more frequent or even continuous deployment of technical personnel, we would give it serious consideration. This would, of course, have no relation to the issue of diplomatic relations.''  Tran Ngoc Thach, a spokesman for the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, confirmed that the idea was under consideration but said it had not been directly discussed between the two countries.  The United States, which has no official presence in Hanoi, says progress on the issue of the missing Americans, along with the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, are prerequisites to better relations. A decade after the end of the Vietnam War, more than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in Indochina, 1,375 of them in Vietnam.  The opening of an American technical office in Hanoi, which Mr. Mochtar said the Vietnamese are actively seeking, would establish the first permanent American presence in the country in a decade.  No Full-Time U.S. Groups  Some Americans - among them scholars and scientists, Congressional delegations, journalists and experts from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii - travel to Vietnam on short visits, but no American organizations work full time there.  Mr. Mochtar, who made a series of trips to Hanoi and Washington earlier this year, says he has come to believe that the conflict in Cambodia stands a better chance of being resolved within the context of improved United States-Vietnamese relations. For this reason, he has been trying to bring about better relations between Hanoi and Washington.  The Foreign Minister is preparing for a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the foreign ministers of Asean, in which the members are Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.  Mr. Mochtar said Friday that he thought Hanoi should concentrate its efforts on the issue of missing Americans as a humanitarian concern and stop viewing it as a bargaining chip.  'Help Them to Help You'  He said he recently told Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, that Vietnam had to be ''forthcoming, or at least seem to be forthcoming on this, so you can turn the tide, which is now running against you.''  ''I know the Americans,'' he said he told the Vietnamese. ''Basically, they are fair. There are still people there who are sympathetic to you. Help them to help you. Make it possible to proceed.  ''The Vietnamese are their own biggest enemy,'' he said, ''because while they are willing to move, publicly they always feel that have to be tough.''  Vietnam, which earlier this year agreed to increase the two nations' consultations on the missing from four a year to six, a few weeks ago abruptly postponed a meeting tentatively scheduled for this month. The talks have been rescheduled for next Wednesday through Friday, according to a Pentagon announcement circulating here. Both sides hope the meeting might in clude the first joint examination of a wartime crash site.  Progress Is Reported  The Vietnamese and the Americans who are close to the talks on the missing had both been reporting encouraging progress.  American officials say the idea of a technical office in Hanoi was first proposed in 1973, the year most American troops were withdrawn and two years before the takeover of Saigon by the North Vietnamese.  According to Americans who were involved with the plan, Hanoi first agreed, then later withdrew its approval. The subject has not been reported to have seriously been raised since then.  Mr. Mochtar said Friday that he was encouraged by the recent American statements that did not rule out a technical office.  ''This news, if it is true, is a very welcome development,'' he said.

"      Vietnam has offered to hold high-level talks with the United States to resolve questions within two years on Americans missing in action, State Department officials said today.  The Hanoi offer, conveyed by Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja of Indonesia four days ago, has received a skeptical response from some Administration officials, who regard it as a possible Hanoi maneuver to deflect attention from repeated criticism of its occupation of Cambodia.  There was also strong suspicion voiced by some officials that the offer was made at this time, virtually on the eve of the annual meeting of the chief non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia, to make Hanoi appear conciliatory, after months of being condemned for its military activity along the Thai-Cambodian border.  Nevertheless, the Administration said it would study the offer to see if it represented a sincere desire by Vietnam to end the continuing problem of the more than 2,400 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina, of which some 1,375 are believed to be missing in Vietnam.  'An Enormous Advance'  Officials traveling with Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Hong Kong said the offer appeared ''to be an enormous advance over what has been done so far.''  Since the capture of Saigon by the Communists in 1975, the United States has been calling for a full accounting of the missing in action. The Vietnamese, who have repeatedly said they have no interest in making an issue out of the question, have nonetheless been slow about returning the remains of Americans who died in Vietnam and are still listed as missing.  There has been one report, which is given credence by American officials, that the remains of at least 400 Americans are in a Vietnamese warehouse.  Administration officials long ago concluded that they did not believe any Americans were still alive in Vietnam, but the search for the remains of the Americans has continued.  Concern Over Chinese Influence  Mr. Mochtar, who is one of the most eager of the Southeast Asian leaders to seek an easing of tensions with Vietnam, has been urging for some time active high-level talks between Washington and Hanoi. He has said that if such talks could be held, this might lead to resolution of the missing-in-action issue and eventually provide the impetus for diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.  Earlier, Mr. Mochtar had proposed that Hanoi and Washington agree on establishing an American technical mission in Hanoi in an effort to step up the recovery of remains. It was not clear if the Hanoi message was a response to that proposal.  Indonesia is concerned about a resurgence of Chinese influence in the region and would like Vietnam to be a buffer, but recognizes that Vietnam should first pull out of Cambodia.  Administration officials said today that no consideration would be given to diplomatic relations with Vietnam until it agreed to withdraw from Cambodia. ----U.S. Says It Is Interested HONG KONG, Sunday, July 7 - A senior official traveling with Secretary of State Shultz said today that the United States was willing to hold high-level talks with Vietnam but that the United States continued to insist on a settlement in Cambodia as a condition for improving relations with Hanoi.  The official said a new proposal made by Vietnam to hold talks aimed at resolving the issue of missing Americans within two years appeared ''to be an enormous advance over what has been done so far'' in determining the fate of the more than 2,400 Americans still listed as missing in Indochina. ----Inquiry on Remains Demanded SAN FRANCISCO, July 6 (AP) - A Florida woman demanding independent identification of 13 American servicemen killed in a 1972 plane crash in Laos has won a federal court order barring the Air Force from returning their remains to relatives.  Ann Hart of Pensacola, Fla., the widow of one of the servicemen, obtained the temporary restraining order late Friday night. The remains were received at Travis Air Force Base Friday night.

"    KONG, July 7   Vietnam has promised to return the remains of 26 more American servicemen who died in the Vietnam War, the largest such turnover since the fighting ended, Americans officials said today.  Officials traveling with Secretary of State George P. Shultz on a tour of Southeast Asia and Australia appeared surprised and delighted at the commitment, which was made to a United States military casualty research group that just ended a three-day mission to Hanoi.  Visit With Cambodia Rebels  On Monday, Mr. Shultz will meet with Thai officials in Bangkok, and on Tuesday he will visit a Cambodian refugee camp inside Thailand on the border with Cambodia. United States officials said Mr. Shultz would meet with two leaders of Cambodia's non-Communist resistance movement in Bangkok.  Hanoi's offer to return the Americans' remains followed a Vietnamese proposal last week to open talks aimed at clearing up the question of missing Americans within two years, a proposal that the American officials said they intended to explore quickly.  ''I think in this meeting we had expected some concrete results; the magnitude of what we got was unexpected,'' said a Reagan Administration official who has been involved in trying to determine the fate of the 2,400 Americans listed as missing in Indochina, more than half of them in Vietnam.  All Were Military Personnel  The officials traveling with Mr. Shultz said Vietnam had provided names for all of the 26 people whose remains were to be turned over and had said all were military personnel.  They said the remains would be processed by the Joint Casualty Research Center in Hawaii to confirm the identifications before families were notified. They added that they had established that some of the names on the list matched servicemen known to have been taken prisoner, but who never came out of Vietnam.  The American officials reported the Vietnamese had said the remains were found ''in the provinces'' and had given no further explanation.  It is expected to take six to eight weeks to complete arrangements for the turnover, the officials said. They said the Vietnamese had also provided ''material evidence or information'' on six other missing Americans.  Until now, the largest number of Americans whose remains were provided by Vietnam was around 20 in 1975, one official said. Since then, remains have been turned over sporadically in groups of six to eight at a time.  Crash Site Is Surveyed  The primary activity of the technical group that visited Vietnam last week was to survey the site of a B-52 crash as a step toward excavation, the officials said. They said that Hanoi had not made a commitment to excavate the site but that a survey to determine the time and manpower required to do so was a normal preliminary.  A senior Administration official said that before responding to Vietnam's expressed willingness to settle the question, the United States must ''define clearly on our side'' what needs to be done to accomplish the work on a two-year schedule. The officials indicated that they would do this as quickly as possible, adding that two years was not too long a time considering the large number of sites that will probably have to be excavated.  ''On the technical level, what we are talking about is mid-rank military people digging the mud, essentially,'' one of the officials said.  The technical mission made one of six such visits to Vietnam that are permitted each year under an agreement worked out early this year.  The American officials here said the United States was willing to consider establishing a permanent technical presence in Hanoi if that became necessary to facilitate the search for and processing of remains, but they stressed that that was not to be interpreted as movement toward normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi. They said that still depended upon Vietnam's ending its military occupation of Cambodia.  But a senior official said the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who is serving as a go-between for Vietnam and the United States, had told the Vietnamese that while the Cambodian occupation stood in the way of normal relations, the issue of the missing Americans also constituted an obstacle.  The officials said that while Vietnam's latest proposal spoke of ''high-level talks,'' it was expected that contacts would continue to be between the Vietnamese Foreign Minister and various assistant secretaries of state or defense or senior members of the National Security Council. Five such meetings have been held in the last three years, they said. ---- #100 Bodies Already Returned WASHINGTON, July 7 - A State Department official said today that Vietnam had previously returned the remains of about 100 American soldiers.  Every time remains have been returned, Vietnam has asserted that the bodies were recently discovered and that it knew of no others, the official said. He said Washington was skeptical of such claims because some of the remains were of servicemen known to have been captured in Vietnam.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 7 1985 ,11
"    LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 10   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Reagan Administration was ready to work ''promptly and decisively'' with Vietnam to resolve the issue of missing Americans.  In his first public response to a request for ''high level'' talks on the issue passed from Hanoi to Washington last week by Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja of Indonesia, Mr. Shultz said at a news conference at the United States Embassy here today:  ''I think the next step for us is - as we will be doing - to organize the kind of group we think would be best able to respond and to let them know in Hanoi that we'd like to start to work on this problem. We want to work at it as promptly and decisively as possible.''  Mr. Shultz's comments followed a decision by Vietnam last week to turn over the remains of 26 Americans thought to have died in Indochina. This was the largest repatriation of remains of M.I.A.'s - missing in action - announced since 1975, when South Vietnam fell to the armies of the North, two years after the withdrawal of American forces. More than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in Indochina, over half of them in Vietnam.  Criticizes Congress on Cambodia  In his remarks today, Mr. Shultz was also critical of Congress for what he called its ''changeability'' as he expressed the Administration's reservations about Congressional efforts to provide non-Communist forces battling Vietnamese troops in Cambodia with $5 million that could be used for military aid. The measure was approved by the House of Representatives on Tuesday.  ''I think we're going to have greater success in our program if we keep it the way it is now,'' he said, referring to the Administration's limiting of aid to mostly humanitarian expenditures.  ''Congress is a very changeable operation,'' he said. ''They are in favor of something at one time and then some things can happen and they can change their mind and you've got a program that's working that gets derailed. We'd like to avoid that.''  Mr. Shultz is in Kuala Lumpur for annual consultations with ministers of the member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.  The Secretary, asked by reporters to clear up a misunderstanding about whether he had brought Thailand a new letter of support from President Reagan, said he had not presented such a document to Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda when they met in Bangkok on Monday. But he indicated that the subject had come up in their conversation when the Thai leader referred to an letter Mr. Reagan sent last April. The letter pledged backing for Thailand in the face of what both countries view as Vietnam's threatening presence in Cambodia.  In his answers to questions at the news conference, he indicated that the United States was prepared to deal with Vietnam directly at a high level. Officials traveling in the Shultz party have suggested that Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, might be among officials likely to visit Hanoi, with which the United States has no formal diplomatic relations.  Indonesian Is Thanked  Mr. Shultz thanked Foreign Minister Mochtar of Indonesia, with whom he will meet privately Thursday, for his efforts in ''supporting our concerns about the M.I.A.-P.O.W. issue.'' He added that on the larger issue of diplomatic ties, Washington would prefer to act on its own.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 10 1985 ,11
"      THERE was optimism last week among many Government officials - and among surviving family members - that the mystery of 2,464 Americans still unaccounted for after the war in Indochina may be closer to resolution.  A United States-sponsored research group that completed a three-day mission in Hanoi early this month reported that the Vietnamese had promised to return the remains of 26 American servicemen and ''material evidence'' regarding the fate of six others. It would be the largest such turnover in the 10 years since the fighting ended.  Potentially more significant, members of the group reported, the Vietnamese took them to a B-52 crash site outside of Hanoi, and left the impression they may be willing, after years of entreaties, to permit a search of the wreckage of other downed aircraft.  The Pentagon believes there are ''several hundred'' such crash sites in Vietnam that may contain enough evidence to close the books on many of the 1,820 missing in that country.  A week earlier, another American team completed its first excavation in Laos, where 556 Americans remain on the missing list. A two-week sifting of a nearly obliterated AC-130 gunship shot down in 1972 produced 13 identifiable sets of remains.  Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense for international security affairs, said that so far the Vietnamese had made no commitment to allow American teams in, but he regarded the B-52 visit as ''an indication that they're certainly leaning in that direction.''  Signal of a Policy Decision  The developments came after a Vietnamese proposal to open talks aimed at resolving questions about the missing Americans within two years.  ''We've never before had this large a turnover, or any kind of a time commitment,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of P.O.W.-M.I.A. Families. ''It signals a policy decision on their part, and we obviously welcome that.'' ''That doesn't mean we're near the end,'' she added.  Nor does it touch on the matter of whether any Americans are still in captivity in Vietnam. A special House committee concluded in 1976 that ''no Americans are still being held alive as prisoners in Indochina, or elsewhere, as a result of the war in Indochina.''  The chairman of the panel, Representative G. V. Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, still gets periodic briefings from Pentagon intelligence specialists.  ''They can't give me a name,'' Mr. Montgomery said last week. ''They can't give me strong evidence.'' A panel appointed by President Carter also concluded that there were no captives.  The Nature of the 'Evidence'  The Administration has been less inclined to rule out that possibility. The official view today, Mr. Armitage said, is: ''We act under the assumption that there is at least one American held against his will in Indochina.''  The ''evidence'' regarding captives appears to consist almost entirely of reports from Vietnamese refugees who say they once saw what they thought were Americans. The Pentagon has recorded 774 such reported sightings; so far, most of the eyewitness accounts either have involved Americans who returned or have been discounted, sometimes with the assistance of lie-detector tests, as fabrications.  That leaves 123 sightings still being examined, according to officials.  Col. Gerald S. Venanzi, a former prisoner of the Vietnamese who is the Pentagon's senior adviser on P.O.W. and M.I.A. affairs, said there is little even in those active files to raise hopes.  Very few of the witnesses mention talking to the alleged American captives. Half are sightings of white men not under guard - possibly Russian advisers, European diplomats or reporters. Only two of the reported sightings have taken place since 1980, and 18 were before the fall of Saigon.  ''A lot among that 123 are just so vague that there is no place to go with them,'' Colonel Venanzi said. ''There's nothing I'd want to take to the store and say, 'This is it, boss.' ''  Still, he is convinced ''there's a lot to investigate.'' The M.I.A. search office told Congress last month it has ''a virtually unlimited budget'' for the cause.  Some critics feel the Administration has exploited the missing Americans. Every year, families of the missing servicemen have been airlifted to Washington for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day - some 800 are expected to fly in at Government expense for a gathering on Friday. On such occasions, the hope has been encouraged that some of the missing will emerge alive.  To those who say such displays raise false hope or smack too much of political showmanship, Mr. Armitage replies that they have paid off, perhaps convincing Hanoi that any hope of normal diplomatic relations depends on as full a reckoning as possible.  No one expects that all of the missing Americans will ever be accounted for. Many are presumed to have crashed into the sea or dense jungle, and the tropical climate quickly destroys evidence.  About 8,100 Americans still remain unaccounted for from the Korean war, and more than 78,000 from World War II, where the United States had the victor's advantage of unimpeded access to former battlefields and crash sites.  At what point will the Administration be satisfied?  Said Mr. Armitage: ''It's kind of like enlightenment. You know when you're there.''

"      The music of the Army Band was punctuated by the firing of the four cannon. Minutes later, the helicopters were seen in the distance.  They came in low, their 10 sets of propellers beating furiously. As they climbed the small hill and prepared to fly over the Pentagon, one suddenly peeled off, trailing a plume of purple smoke. The crowd below saw, heard, felt the other nine streak overhead.  It was yet another episode in a war that President Reagan has said has never ended, at least for the families and friends of the 2,464 Americans still officially listed as unaccounted for, most of them in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Today, by the President's declaration, was National P.O.W./M.I.A. Recognition Day.  'A Special Duty'  Here in the capital, the band and the helicopters were part of a Recognition Day ceremony at the Pentagon. More than 1,000 families and friends of prisoners of war and those missing in action waited on the shadeless lawn to hear Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reassure them that the Administration has not forgotten their loved ones.  ''We in the military services have a special duty to those who served with us in combat,'' he said. Then, echoing the President, the general said: ''We write no last chapters. We close no books.'' America's involvement will not end, he said, until there has been a full accounting for those still missing.  The Pentagon ceremony, opened by Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft 4th with a 19-gun salute and closed by the helicopters in a ''Missing Man'' formation, was part of remembrances all across the country. It also coincided with the 16th annual national convention of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, meeting in suburban Alexandria, Va.  Vice President Bush spoke to the group in the afternoon, but his was not the name on everybody's lips. ''Rambo,'' it seems, was the favorite topic of speculation and discussion. Taken from the current motion picture about a Vietnam veteran who returns to rescue American P.O.W.'s, the name is also associated with a faction of the League of Families that wants the league, and the Government, to take more decisive action toward recovering the missing.  Mr. Bush did his part to fuel the hopes and answer the prayers of the convention-goers, announcing that the Laotian Government agreed this week to excavate the site of a United States jet crash in an effort to recover the remains of the fliers. It was reported earlier this month that a joint Laotian-United States excavation of another crash site, in Pakse, in eastern Laos, had produced 13 identifiable sets of remains.  One unifying element among those attending the convention is the feeling that Washington is not being honest with the families of the missing.  Two sisters from the West Coast, in their first trip to the national convention, thought for one hopeful moment that they had learned something about the whereabouts of their father, a Navy aviator shot down in the war zone more than 10 years ago. The sisters saw a Defense Department file today that indicated the father had survived and had been taken prisoner, but hours later they were told by Pentagon officials that the notification was merely a form letter that did not refer to their father and had made its way into his file by mistake.  Even the efforts the Administration is making to recover the missing in Laos are met with skepticism. The Government says the remains of an Air Force crew member, George MacDonald, shot down in a AC-130 gunship over Laos in 1972, were among those recovered in the Pakse excavation and were returned to Travis Air Force Base in California earlier this month. His brother Gregory is not so sure. ''I'm just distrustful of the Government's position,'' he said.  The suspicion stems from a lawsuit filed in the case of another Air Force man, Lieut. Col. Thomas T. Hart, that says the Air Force does not actually know whether the identities assigned to the recovered Pakse remains are accurate. A declaration filed in the suit by a forensic expert says it is impossible to determine whether the remains identified as Colonel Hart's are, in fact, his or whether they are even from the same person.  It is evidence like this that leaves people like Gregory MacDonald wondering. ''I don't know what the Government's motivation is,'' he said. ''There are so many upset people out there who feel there's been a fraud perpetrated.''  Debbie Stein of St. Louis says her brother, Cpl. Larry Green, has been missing since 1968. Her attitude might be indicative of the attitude of most of the crowd at the convention. She feels that ceremonies, like today's at the Pentagon, are too little, too late, but she is heartened by recent developments in talks with the Vietnamese and the Laotians, and she intends to give her support at next year's convention.  Still, she mused, ''It would be nice if there wasn't a next year.''

"   , Thailand, July 20   Laos said today that it would send a team of officials to Hawaii to join the United States in preparing for a search for servicemen missing in action from the war in Indochina.  Laos told the United States Embassy in Vientiane Thursday that it had accepted an American invitation to send a delegation to the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Honolulu late this year, the Laotian press agency said in a broadcast monitored in Bangkok.  The agency said Laos was preparing for a joint excavation of the crash site of a United States aircraft during the next November-to-May dry season.  It said Laos pledged further cooperation in the search for missing servicemen and expressed hope ''the U.S. Government will take concrete, reasonable steps responding to this humanitarian and good-will attitude.''

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 14   The Government today turned over what may be the remains of 26 Americans missing in the Vietnam War. It also indicated acceptance of a proposed visit by senior United States officials later this month to resolve the entire issue of the missing in action.  Today an American team took custody of the latest remains and, after a ceremony, they were flown to Honolulu for analysis. If they can be identified, they would represent Vietnam's largest single delivery of remains since the end of the war.  The bones given to the American delegation today were packed in 26 numbered crates. A folded American flag was placed on top of each and they were carried one by one onto a C-130 transport plane as 18 United States soldiers, sailors and airmen saluted.  Vietnamese officials also provided unspecified material evidence, including identification tags, from six other servicemen missing in action, Previously Vietnam had handed over the remains of 99 missing, but 2,464 American servicemen and civilians are still unaccounted for in Indochina, more than half of them in Vietnam. The previous largest single delivery of remains was 22 sets of bones, in 1977.  On the American visit, for which a date has yet to be set, Col. Vo Dong Giang, a Deputy Foreign Minister, told reporters, ''I am confident in telling you that the proposal is acceptable.''  Diplomatic sources in Bangkok, Thailand, said the United States delegation would include Paul D. Wolfowitz, an Assistant Secretary of State; Richard L. Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Richard Childress, a member of the National Security Council staff. Mr. Armitage led a team here in February 1984.  Washington and Hanoi do not have diplomatic relations. Although the visit would not involve recognition of the Vietnamese Government, diplomatic sources said, it would have symbolic significance.  Colonel Giang said Vietnam would try to resolve the issue of the missing in the next two years, exerting ''our greatest efforts to find the remains until we believe that no matter what efforts, no more remains will be found.''  He expressed the hope that the United States would refrain from hostile statements so that Vietnam could resolve its security problems and concentrate on economic development.

"    Vietnam took a step last week toward improving relations with the United States. It turned over the remains of 26 people who may have been among the 2,464 American servicemen missing when the Vietnam war ended in 1974.  A Vietnamese doctor said that, with the help of photographs, the remains of 20 of the men had been identified as Americans. No photographs had been available to identify five others, he said; the 26th person was an ethnic Asian. The remains were flown to Honolulu for analysis. Vietnam also turned over identification tags and other evidence from six other missing servicemen.  Until last week, Hanoi had returned remains of only 99 of the men missing in action in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Some American officials have suggested that Vietnam is holding the remains of 400 others in hopes of negotiating concessions from the United States.  Vietnam also indicated last week its readiness to talk to a delegation of senior American officials in Hanoi on Aug. 28-29. Paul Wolfowitz, an Assistant Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Richard Childress, a National Security Council aide, are expected to go. Secretary of State George P. Shultz recently said he wanted to work on clearing up the issue of the missing servicemen ''as promptly and as decisively as possible.'' The United States has refused to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam until the issue of the missing servicemen is resolved and until Vietnam ends its occupation of Cambodia. There has been no discernible progress on Cambodia.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of U.S. loading remains of M.I.A.'s onto plane in Hanoi(AP)                      ",August 18 1985 ,11
"      A United States delegation scheduled to meet with Vietnamese officials to discuss the fate of missing American servicemen postponed its departure for Hanoi today after learning that Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach would not be present for the meetings next week.  The Vietnamese Government announced in July that it was prepared to resolve within two years the question of Americans missing in action, and wanted to hold high-level talks to discuss it. Nearly 2,500 Americans are listed as missing in the Indochina war, more than half of them in Vietnam.  The American delegation that had been scheduled to leave Saturday planned to spend two days in Hanoi and half a day in Laos.  A State Department statement said only that the delegation ''may have to reschedule'' the trip because of ''some difficulty in scheduling participation on the Vietnamese side.''  A senior Administration official said Mr. Thach's participation was considered crucial. Mr. Thach was in Indonesia this week and there were unconfirmed reports he had gone on to Moscow. The official said there was hope that the Vietnamese would offer ''clarification'' and that the delegation could leave with a delay of only a day or two.

"      The Reagan Administration said today that talks last week with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi were ''the most positive'' to date in the 12-year effort to resolve the problem of Americans unaccounted for in the Vietnam War.  A State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said that ''I am pleased to state that the talks were very productive'' and that the meeting ''took place in a constructive atmosphere.''  Last Wednesday and Thursday, a four-member United States team led by Richard Childress, the political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff, met with the acting Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Vo Dong Giang, and with Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son.  Originally, a higher-level American delegation, led by Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, had been scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach. But when Mr. Thach informed Washington on Aug. 23 that he had to travel to Moscow, Mr. Armitage and Mr. Wolfowitz canceled plans at the last minute to fly to Hanoi.  The assumption at that time in Washington was that the Vietnamese, who at first had proposed ''high-level talks'' to resolve the question of unaccounted-for Americans ''in two years,'' were having second thoughts. The lower-level Childress mission was authorized to have ''technical talks.''  State Department officials said today that Mr. Childress, who was accompanied by Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, was surprised to find the Vietnamese officials ready, even at the secondary level, to discuss for the first time all aspects of the issue.  ''This was the first time that we had a totally nonpolemical discussion with the Vietnamese,'' a State Department official said. ''They did not raise any preconditions for cooperation.'' In previous meetings, Hanoi had indicated that progress on the missing-in-action issue depended on the United States improving relations with Vietnam or granting it foreign aid.  Neither issue was raised this time, but American officials believe that Hanoi still hopes to achieve both.  During the talks, Mr. Redman said, the United States conveyed to the Vietnamese ''an outline of a process to resolve the issue in Vietnam within two years.'' Vietnam ''presented its own plan to resolve the issue in a short time.''  'A Number of Common Elements'  ''There are a number of common elements between the two concepts,'' he said.  A total of 1,820 Americans in Vietnam are carried on one of two rolls - those who were at one time listed as prisoners of war, or missing in action, and those who were believed to be killed in action but whose bodies have not been recovered. Despite movies that portray Americans being held in Vietnam, State Department officials said there is no evidence to indicate that any are alive. But there is a desire, they said, to clear up questions raised by reported sightings of Westerners who could be Americans.  According to State Department officials, the United States suggested a three-part approach to the Vietnamese: first, to obtain the release of any prisoners or at least to resolve the issue of live prisoners; second, for the Vietnamese to step up their efforts to recover the remains of dead Americans; and third, to undertake surveys and excavations in areas where the United States believes remains may be found.  The thrust of the American plan, a State Department official said, was for joint American-Vietnamese efforts, with American teams being allowed to observe the Vietnamese efforts and to aid in the search.  The Vietnamese, in their plan, put the stress on increased Vietnamese efforts and showed little enthusiasm for joint teams, but did not rule the idea out, an official said.  Hanoi Denies G.I.'s Are Alive  Hanoi denies that any missing Americans are still alive, officials said.  The most contentious issue deals with the Vietnamese turning over remains. Washington believes that Hanoi has stored the remains of hundreds of Americans, some of which it returns periodically to the United States. Most recently, Hanoi turned over the remains of 26 Americans. Altogether, Vietnam has returned the remains of 99 men.  State Department officials said the Vietnamese seem much more determined to deal with the question of the unaccounted-for Americans. ''They know they have to do so to improve relations with us,'' one State Department official said.  ''We believe the talks were the most positive step yet in the ongoing process toward resolution of this issue,'' Mr. Redman said.  Ever since the cease-fire agreement was signed in 1973 on ending the Vietnam War, the United States has been seeking a full accounting of its men in Vietnam. But the effort has had the highest priority in the Reagan Administration, which was critical of the way past administrations dealt with the question.  The United States has said it would not improve relations with Hanoi until the missing-in-action question was resolved and until Hanoi withdrew its forces from Cambodia. The Vietnamese have occupied Cambodia since crushing the Communist Government of Pol Pot in early 1979 but have recently said they foresaw pulling out by 1990. There are believed to be about 160,000 Vietnamese in Cambodia bolstering the Government of Heng Samrin.  U.S. Comments on Pol Pot  In another development, the State Department said it would be ''a positive step'' if Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, has actually retired from active command of his forces. Since the Vietnamese victory over his forces in 1979, Mr. Pol Pot has led the Khmer Rouge in a continuing insurgency, with the aid of China. There are two non-Communist rebel groups in Cambodia, one led by the former chief of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the other by Son Sann, a former official in the old Cambodian Government.  Because the Pol Pot regime has been charged with the deaths of more than two million Cambodians during its rule, the United States and most other countries have had no contact with it.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 14   Vietnam today announced the devaluation of its currency for the second time in less than six months, according to a Hanoi radio broadcast monitored here.  Hanoi also canceled all flights in and out of the country.  Officials of the Vietnamese Embassy here were not available for comment.  The moves followed a Vietnamese decision to stop supplying subsidized rations to Government employees.  Until this week the currency, the dong, was worth about 350 to 400 to the dollar on the black market. But on Friday it was reported to be selling unofficially at 1,000 to the dollar in Ho Chi Minh City.  Vietnam, a country of about 60 million, last devalued its currency in April. At that time the official rate of about 11 dong to the dollar was changed to 100 to the dollar.  In both the north and south of the country, however, illegal currency exchanges have become standard practice, with Vietnamese in shops and on the streets crossing wrists in front of foreigners to indicate they wanted to buy hard currency.

There are still 1,369 Americans listed as missing in action in Vietnam and a total of 2,464 in all of Indochina.  The technical team, led by Col.

The meeting is the fourth technical-level session this year.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 25 1985 ,11
"      Although the United States is sending a high-level delegation to Hanoi next week, there has been no visible movement toward formal diplomatic relations.  Officials believe Hanoi is ready for normal relations, partly as a balance with its involvement with the Soviet Union, but also to rebuff China and to obtain American investment in such fields as offshore oil exploration. Vietnamese officials have welcomed private Americans who have urged reconciliation and exchange programs. A group of educators is to visit Vietnam this week, for example, to lay the groundwork for a teacher exchange.  But more than 10 years after the end of the Vietnam War, the United States continues to resist diplomatic relations, citing as the latest obstacle the presence of an estimated 140,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Hanoi, which invaded in 1978, accuses China of having used Cambodia as a surrogate to attack Vietnam.  ''We will not normalize until this is resolved to allow the Khmer people to have free choice,'' Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, said in a recent interview.  Highest Delegation Since '77  Mr. Armitage is going to Hanoi with Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and with Richard Childress, political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff at the White House.  It is the highest-level delegation since 1977, when Leonard Woodcock, then president of the United Auto Workers, was sent by President Carter to explore opening diplomatic relations. Those efforts fell victim to a series of events in 1978, including the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the establishment of Chinese-American relations.  The talks next week are to focus on the other major issue between Hanoi and Washington: accounting for Americans missing in action.  ''The Vietnamese have indicated greater cooperation on this issue than was evident heretofore,'' Mr. Armitage said.  In recent months, he said, Vietnam has returned remains of Americans at a faster rate and has allowed an American team to search a B-52 crash site, the first of a series to be explored.  Plan Presented by Hanoi  In August, Mr. Armitage said, Vietnamese officials presented the United States with a plan to obtain and provide as much information on the missing as possible by the end of 1987. Consequently, the Administration has adopted the view that accounting for the missing is ''not a precondition to any sort of normalization,'' as Mr. Armitage put it.  In a wider sense, however, it has political impact on American attitudes.  ''They know fully and without a doubt that this issue is not going to go away,'' Mr. Armitage said. ''It is not a precondition. But it is a simple fact of life that the American people will not stand for normalization until this problem is resolved.''  The lingering preoccupation with the missing and the unwillingness to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam are seen by some Americans as symptoms of an inability to heal the wounds of war.  ''For Americans, there is no closure,'' said John McAuliff, director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a program of the SANE Education Fund. ''There has begun to be individual closure, with individuals making the trip back to Vietnam. But more important, there is no societal closure in which one can really say things are back to normal, the country is at peace.''  A Former Antiwar Activist  Mr. McAuliff, who was interviewed before heading for Vietnam with the educators, is one of several antiwar activists who have turned their efforts to improving American-Vietnamese ties. He believes that formal relations would have concrete benefits for both sides.  Diplomatic recognition by Washington, he said, ''would encourage sectors of the Vietnamese Government that take a more reformist and liberal approach and a more trusting approach to their people.''  There could also be joint research, he said, into the effects of dioxin, a toxic chemical contained in the defoliant Agent Orange, which was used by United States forces in Vietnam.  Dioxin has been found in the soil of some American communities. Its effect on health could be measured by examining South Vietnamese residents who have high levels in their bodies, Mr. McAuliff said. Effect on Vietnamese in U.S.  He said normalization would also make it possible for Vietnamese living in the United States to visit Vietnam and would have an effect on their politics here.  ''As long as there is not normalization,'' Mr. McAuliff said, ''it kind of feeds the hopes of the right-wing activists in the Vietnamese community that they can somehow stage a return. Once the U.S. recognizes that there is a single, unified Vietnam, it really does say to people, 'Look, you have to make your lives here now.' ''  From Vietnam's standpoint, American officials and Asian diplomats observe, relations with Washington could help an ailing economy. The present trade embargo inhibits Vietnam's purchase of spare parts for American equipment left behind at the end of the war. It has also created a vacuum into which the Soviet Union has stepped with an estimated $1 billion a year in aid.  Since North Vietnamese troops rolled into Saigon in April 1975 and the last Americans left in helicopters from the United States Embassy roof, Vietnam has been drawn into a relationship of both dependence on and wariness of the Soviet Union. Dependent for aid to its flagging economy and military strength against a hostile China, it has entered into elaborate trade, diplomatic and military agreements with Moscow.  Determined to Be Autonomous  But Vietnamese officials also emphasize their determination to remain autonomous, an effort that took several forms in the first years after 1975. One was a demand for United States ''reparations'' for damage caused in the war as a condition for diplomatic ties.  One Hanoi official recently said that condition was ''a mistake'' and had infuriated Americans. The demand was dropped in December 1977.  In addition, Vietnam initially resisted Soviet pressure to use American-built military bases in Cam Ranh Bay, Da Nang and elsewhere. The aversion has diminished over the years, and the Russians have gradually gained a military presence.  According to Mr. Armitage, an average of 25 Soviet Navy vessels, including submarines, are moored in Cam Ranh Bay at any given time. MIG-23 jet fighters and long-range aircraft are based there and at Da Nang, he said, with the MIG's scheduled to be turned over to the Vietnamese.  Still, in conversations with Westerners, Vietnamese officials stress their desire not to become to the Soviet Union what the Philippines are to the United States, an allusion to the freedom of the United States to use bases in the Philippines as it wishes.  Fear of China Is Deep  But Vietnam's fear of China, rooted deeply in history, keeps Hanoi close to Moscow and is used as an argument to keep Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Some Americans note the long historical record of Vietnam's trying to expand into Cambodia.  But Vietnamese officials see two ways out: building up their allied Cambodian forces until they are able to of maintain a pro-Vietnamese regime in power, or arriving at some political solution involving the Cambodian anti-Vietnamese guerrillas that would permit Vietnamese withdrawal before 1990, when Hanoi has said its troops will depart.  For the moment, at least, this has frozen the Vietnamese-American relationship.  ''They will only withdraw,'' Mr. Armitage insisted, ''if they have succeeded in their plan to suborn Khmer culture. I don't think that's possible. They tried that in the 1800's.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 2 1986 ,11
"    The United States and Vietnam do not agree about much, but Hanoi has evidently accepted Washington's insistence that it must cooperate in accounting for the 1,797 Americans listed as missing in the war that ended in 1975. This week, the most senior United States officials to visit Hanoi in eight years are to meet with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thac to lay the groundwork for closing the books.  The Vietnamese ''have evidenced greater cooperation on this issue'' of late, said Richard L. Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense.  He will be accompanied to Hanoi by Assistant Secretary of State Paul D. Wolfowitz; Richard Childress, a senior National Securitry Council aide, and Anne Mills Griffith of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. Mr. Childress and Mrs. Griffith went to Vietnam in September for talks that the State Department said had been the ''most positive'' to date.  In November, Americans and Vietnamese searched a site near Hanoi where a B-52 bomber crashed in 1972. However, bone fragments that they unearthed are believed unlikely to help identify missing Americans.  Vietnam has said it wants to clear up the issue of the missing, presumably to pave the way for diplomatic relations with Washington and to mitigate its dependence on the Soviet Union, which provides $1 billion a year in aid.  Washington, however, insists that relations cannot begin until the estimated 140,000 Vietnamese soldiers occupying Cambodia are removed. ''We will not normalize,'' Mr. Armitage said, ''until this is resolved to allow the Khmer people to have free choice.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 5 1986 ,11

"   , Vietnam, Tuesday, Jan. 7   Two days of high-level talks between the United States and Vietnam on the issue of Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War ended today with both sides expressing satisfaction with negotiations but calling for quicker progress on unresolved cases.  It was announced that a round of technical discussions would take place late next month to consider what the Vietnamese described as 50 new reports of remains. The two sides also talked about the opening of an American technical office here but decided such a move was unnecessary at this point, according to the American side.  The United States delegation, the highest to come to Vietnam since the war, was led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, who spoke to reporters after the final session today. He was joined at the news conference by Hoang Bich Son, the Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, who headed Hanoi's delegation.  Meeting With Foreign Minister  The Americans met earlier this morning with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach. Mr. Thach, leaving the Foreign Ministry guest house, a former French colonial governor's palace, said that while both sides were pleased with the discussions, they sought quicker progress.  Mr. Son said later that a two-year timetable for resolving the question of missing Americans, which Vietnam announced in July, would now go into effect. But he and Mr. Thach said they hoped the issue could be resolved in less than two years.  The United States has made a fuller accounting of missing Americans a prerequisite for better relations with Vietnam. A total of 1,797 Americans are unaccounted for in Vietnam and around its shores.  Talks on Prisoners of War  While the United States has largely agreed with Vietnam that there is almost no likelihood that any missing Americans are still alive, there have been repeated reports in the United States of evidence that some Americans are being held prisoner.  The issue of prisoners of war was raised this morning, according to Foreign Minister Thach. ''I have assured them that there is no one alive in our hands,'' he said.  Officials said the atmosphere around the talks had been businesslike and devoid of ceremony.  Over the last year both the Vietnamese and the Reagan Administration have said they have been encouraged by progress on the issue of the missing Americans. In July the Vietnamese returned the remains of 26 Americans killed during the war, most of them downed airmen.  In November Hanoi allowed the first joint excavation of an American B-52 crash site near Hanoi.  The United States delegation at the talks here included Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Richard K. Childress of the National Security Council, and Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families, which represents the relatives of missing Americans.  Also in the delegation were Col. Howard Hill of the Defense Department and M. Lyall Breckon, director of the State Department's Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia section.  The Vietnamese Delegates  The Vietnamese delegation included Mr. Son; Nguyen Dy Nien, an Assistant Foreign Minister; Tran Hoan, director of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's North American Department, and Nguyen Can, the Deputy Director of North American Affairs.  The United States had insisted that the meeting be confined to the issue of missing Americans. The Vietnamese sought to broaden the discussions to other issues holding up American diplomatic recognition of Hanoi.  Washington has said there will be no diplomatic relations or economic help until Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia. Hanoi toppled the Khmer Rouge Government there seven years ago today and now occupies the country with more than 150,000 troops.  Hanoi is openly acknowledging that it would like to link the opening of any American liaison office in Hanoi with the opening of a Vietnamese mission in Washington.  Hanoi Seeks Warmer Ties  On Saturday, Vo Dong Giang, a Minister of State at the Vietnamese Foreign Office, told reporters that it was only fair that if the Americans were present in Hanoi, the Vietnamese should be present in Washington.  Asian officials and diplomats based in Hanoi said the Vietnamese attached great importance to the meeting with the Americans because Hanoi needed to improve relations with Washington for several reasons.  Diplomats describe the Vietnamese leadership as uncomfortable in an exclusive alliance with the Soviet Union.  The Vietnamese, they say, would like to be able to play Washington and Moscow off against each other in the region, where both Soviet and American strategic interests are at stake.  Vietnam would also like warmer relations with China, which would give Hanoi even more leverage in dealing with the great powers, diplomats say.  Reconstruction Is Aim  In a meeting with reporters on Monday while the first session of the talks was in progress, Mr. Giang, the Minister of State, was asked why Vietnam wanted better relations with Washington. ''We do not want to improve relations only with Washington,'' he said. ''We want to improve relations with all the people around us because we need a peaceful framework for reconstruction.''  There are those close to Hanoi who contend that Vietnam, now one of the world's poorest countries, continues to hold out hope for some kind of American reparations for the war or at least for American help in development.  But even without recompense, Vietnam appears to believe that it would gain substantially from United States recognition in terms of unofficial aid from American and international organizations. A number of private American humanitarian organizations say they would like to aid the Vietnamese but have been blocked by the diplomatic situation.

"   , Vietnam   ''You Americans have given the world a false impression of Vietnam,'' a European with long experience in Indochina said last week, just before Hanoi welcomed the highest-level United States delegation to visit Vietnam since the war ended. ''These people are not giants.'' The theme is repeated by diplomats, aid officials, scholars and the few business representatives who somehow manage to trade with Vietnam. The country they describe is not the vanquisher of two large Western armies or the conqueror of Pol Pot. It is a very poor, chronically undernourished, badly administered nation riven by ministerial rivalries in the capital and gestures of defiance in the provinces, whose authorities hew to the old Vietnamese adage that ''the power of the emperor stops at the village gate.''  Foreigners from East and West not party to the affair say they are fascinated if not mystified by the emotional links that persist between the Vietnamese and Americans. For the Vietnamese, the focus on the United States, where friends and family of many live, is constant. To Americans, Vietnam might be just another poor third world country clamoring for attention - except for the war, and those who never came back.  In American perceptions, Hanoi remains a threat to all of Southeast Asia because of its overthrow seven years ago of Pol Pot's Government in Cambodia and its domination of Laos, which have angered and frightened Vietnam's other neighbors. The Reagan Administration has said it will not recognize Hanoi until Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia.  Yet the Vietnamese need all that American diplomatic recognition can offer. They hope for, among other things, the relaxation of a Western and Japanese aid embargo, a way out of increasingly unproductive economic dependence on Moscow and help in manuevering China into a Cambodian settlement. For aid, at least, time is short - the average weight of a Vietnamese citizen is dropping at the rate of a pound or two a year, international health officials say, and the country is nearly bereft of medicines except for supplies sent by relatives abroad. Last week, Vietnamese officials were acknowledging that a decade after uniting the country under socialism, Hanoi has been unable to suppress the private traders who still manipulate the vital rice market.  'Mutual Benefit'  But, out of pride and ideological orthodoxy, Vietnamese leaders almost always refer to the country as ''reconstructing'' rather than ''developing.'' And they insist that diplomatic relations with Washington would be ''of mutual benefit.''  Foreigners who live in Hanoi say that, while the Vietnamese people may be secretive or uncommunicative, they are neither inherently militaristic nor highly disciplined, as they have been portrayed in the West -except in the army. The remarkable self-sacrifice that sustained a 30-year fight for independence, diplomats and some Vietnamese civilians suggest, is not translating easily into dying for Cambodians in a new war categorized here as ''implementing an international obligation.''  On their side of the funhouse mirror, many Vietnamese cling to some stereotypical pictures of Americans. ''Americans are stingy and selfish; they do not pay attention to the sufferings of other people,'' Hong Ha, the editor of the Communist party newspaper and a member of the party's central committee, said last week. His remark, which he said reflected letters the newspaper received from readers, referred to the well-publicized American failure to offer aid to Vietnam last fall after tropical storms left crops ruined and hundreds of thousands of people homeless.  The Vietnamese also resent Washington's insistence that their country account for nearly 1,800 missing American servicemen, or M.I.A.'s, a small fraction of the number of Vietnamese still unaccounted for in their own land.  War Reparations  Mr. Ha gave this illustration: ''One of our readers sent us a letter asking: The Americans staged a war that caused a lot of difficulties for our country. Why should we let them come to Vietnam to look for the wreckage of their planes when they have not fulfilled their responsibilities to the Vietnamese people?''  The reader was referring to war reparations, a hope being raised again in official circles as talks between Hanoi and Washington are making progress.  Sensing movement, Vietnamese leaders seem to be adding for immediate consideration elements not previously on the agenda.  During two days of talks last week, the Vietnamese offered to start the clock on a two-year deadline for resolving the issue of Americans missing in action and to investigate reports that the remains of 50 Americans have been found in the countryside. Technical discussions will be conducted in late February.  For itself, Vietnam now wants an office in Washington or another American city such as Philadelphia, according to some reports. While the Vietnamese have suggested an American technical office in Hanoi, which would coordinate searches for the wreckage of American planes, United States officials have been reluctant because such an office might be portrayed by Hanoi as a diplomatic presence. Vietnam's new demand strikes some diplomats here as a something of a justification for United States apprehension.  ''One of the good things about Vietnam,'' a European said, ''is that you can always be frank. So I asked my Vietnamese friends: How many M.I.A.'s do you have in America that you should have an office there?''  TEN YEARS OF TALK ON MISSING AMERICANS  Vietnamese and American officials have met sporadically over the last 10 years, with a long hiatus after Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia, to discuss the fate of missing Americans and other obstacles to establishing normal relations. Here are some of the major meetings:  November 1976 United States and Vietnamese diplomats meet in Paris in the first formal talks since the war; no progress is reported, and three days later the United States vetoes Vietnam's United Nations membership application.  March 1977  President Carter sends a delegation to Hanoi; Vietnam turns over the remains of 12 American pilots and proposes a new round of talks.  May-June 1977  A United States delegation holds more talks with the Vietnamese in Paris about normalization of relations.  August 1978  A delegation led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy discusses humanitarian issues with officials in Hanoi, then leaves with 29 Vietnamese, the first to be reunited with American husbands and fathers.  July 1985  A United States-sponsored research group spends three days in Hanoi; Vietnam promises to return remains of 26 American servicemen.  August 1985  At a meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam proposes a two-year timetable for resolving the fate of missing Americans.  November 1985  A United States military delegation spends 13 days with a Vietnamese team excavating a site where a B-52 crashed in 1972.

"   , Thailand, Jan. 12   While American and Vietnamese officials expressed satisfaction last week with the atmosphere of good will surrounding two days of high-level talks in Hanoi on Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War, both sides agreed that they had reached a time when building confidence and increasing cooperation would be critical.  Material progress will have to be made, they said, if the issue of the missing is no longer to prevent better relations between the two countries.  There are potential problems on both sides, officials said, and the wide attention paid to the negotiations, which produced no breakthroughs, could sharpen divisions.  Wants U.S. to 'Leave Us Alone'  Not all Vietnamese leaders favor cooperation with the United States.  Asked by reporters last Monday what he most wanted from Washington, Vo Dong Giang, the second-highest ranking official in the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, said, ''We would like the U.S. to leave us alone and stop assisting China in the latter's efforts to undermine us.''  During the talks last week, it became clear, officials said, that the Vietnamese had rejected American proposals made last summer for a joint plan of action on the missing.  The Vietnamese, apparently unwilling to share too much information related to their own national security, did pledge, however, to begin this month their own two-year program to account for as many Americans as possible. Anti-American language has been absent from public pronouncements.  The leader of the Vietnamese delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son, said in a meeting with reporters at the end of the discussions that Hanoi had already begun an ''educational campaign'' in the countryside that had produced 50 new reports of possible American war dead. He said the reports would be presented to an American-Vietnamese technical meeting in Hanoi at the end of February.  U.S. Show of Good Will  Hanoi has said publicly that the Vietnamese people could not be persuaded to help look for missing Americans until the United States showed more good will toward Vietnam.  The United States Defense Department, which lists 1,797 American soldiers and civilians unaccounted for in Vietnam or off its coasts, promised in return to assist Hanoi with information or equipment needed for searches.  On their side, the Americans have to contend with what they call the ''Rambo factor'' in the United States. United States officials said private crusades, often couched in what they termed a crude anti-Communism that diplomats and American military officers dealing with the issue of the war-dead say they abhor, threatened to undermine years of low-key efforts that seem ready to produce results.  Diplomats in Hanoi said repeated private assertions by Americans that Hanoi is still holding, possibly under conditions of extreme deprivation or even torture, scores of Americans on the missing list were particularly rankling to the Vietnamese.  Possibility Not Ruled Out  United States officials said they were not ruling out the possibility that some of the missing Americans might still be alive in Vietnam. But American officials said they were seeking ways to allow the Vietnamese to save face in acounting for any such Americans.  European diplomats in Hanoi who regularly check reports of sightings of Americans are virtually unanimous in doubting that there are many, if any, prisoners held by Vietnam. But they said the chances were good that there were some deserters living in Vietnamese villages.  Diplomatic ways are also being sought to recover war dead that most Americans close to the issue say they believe are already in the possession of the Vietnamese.  Asian diplomats said it would be extremely embarrassing for Hanoi to be seen in the eyes of the world as having hoarded American bodies more than a decade after the war for future trade-offs.  ''We are Asians, too, and we know how they think,'' an Indonesian said. ''The Vietnamese now understand that they have dissipated the good will they had in the developing world with their occupation of Cambodia. They can't get away with using these bodies as poker chips.''  A Humanitarian Issue  Both sides have been working hard to live up to their assertions that the issue of the missing is a strictly humanitarian one and that it will not be used in the negotiations as a bargaining ploy or a means of scoring political points.  It has long been assumed by regional diplomats and officials that Hanoi would benefit most from a resolution of the issue, as Vietnam needs Western technical assistance and help in resolving the seven-year-old war in Cambodia.  Lately, however, diplomats in Hanoi have been questioning whether the seemingly deteriorating security situation in the Philippines might not be causing the United States to look more closely again at mainland Southeast Asia.  Although diplomats say Vietnam is not likely to be persuaded to eject a large Soviet military presence, as Egypt once did, Hanoi is thought to want more balanced international relationships.  ''They don't want to be another tropical fruit farm for Moscow - like Cuba,'' a European with experience in assisting the Vietnamese said.

Senator Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, led a Congressional delegation to Hanoi to urge the Vietnamese to help resolve the cases of Americans who remain listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.  The delegation left today after Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told them no that Americans were being held against their will.  But the lawmaker was accompanied by Nguyen Vu Chinh, 10 years old, and Tran Thanh Quynh, 9. The two chidlren are to rejoin their mother in Alaska on Tuesday.  Mother Lives in Fairbanks  Their mother, Xuan Thi Nguyen, fled to the United States seven years ago and now lives in Fairbanks. She had asked the Senator's office to help get her children out of Vietnam.  ''I'm just very emotionally moved at the sight of those two kids here with us on the way to a new life,'' said Senator Murkowski, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.  ''I'm so pleased and so humbled that we can bring them to their mother, that they will have the opportunity that we enjoy living in America.''  The chidlren were accompanied from Ho Chi Minh city by their aunt, Nguyen Thi Sau, 30, who raised them in their hometown of Tay Ninh after their mother left.  Senator Murkowski said last-minute red tape threatened to stall the exchange when low-ranking officials questioned whether the children's paperwork was complete.

"   , Laos, Jan. 19   A United States Congressional delegation said today that Laotian officials had rejected an appeal to allow Americans to enter Laos to help investigate possible sightings of American soldiers.  The four-member delegation reported that although the parting toasts were cordial, the talks had produced little new information on the fate of 556 Americans still listed as missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam War.  The four lawmakers, representing the Veterans Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, met for two hours with Soubanh Sritthirath, the Deputy Foreign Minister, and then for less than an hour with Foreign Minister Phoun Sipaseut.  The delegation was concluding a trip to the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. It was led by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the Senate committee, and included Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona; Representative Bob McEwen, Republican of Ohio, and Representative Michael Bilirakis, Republican of Florida. #95 Sightings Still Stand Since the war ended in 1975, 806 ''live sightings'' of Americans in Indochina have been reported, mostly by refugees, according to United States Government records. Investigations have ruled out the possibility of living Americans in all but 95 reports, including 13 in Laos, United States officials say.  A total of 2,441 Americans are still listed as missing in action in the Indochina conflict - 556 of them in Laos, 88 in Cambodia and 1,797 in Vietnam.  Senator Murkowski said he and his colleagues had pressed the Laotians to allow independent verification of their position that no missing Americans are alive in Laos.  Senator DeConcini said he had asked that the United States be allowed to send observers with Laotian teams to the area of the sightings in Laos. Foreign Minister Phoun Sipaseut refused.  Mr. McEwen proposed that an international team from the Red Cross or the United Nations accompany Laotian searchers, but he said the Foreign Minister had bristled at the idea.  Laos Reports Wide Census  Senator Murkowski said he had suggested to the Foreign Minister that some Americans might be living in Laos but ''not in your control.''  He quoted Mr. Phoun Sipaseut as saying that his Government had conducted an extensive national census last year that found no Americans, and that notices had been distributed throughout Laos asking people for information on Americans.  ''The minister told us three times, 'There are absolutely none,' '' Senator Murkowski said.  On Saturday, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam pledged that any of the lawmakers could personally investigate any reported live sighting in Vietnam, but he said Vietnam was not holding any Americans.  Senator DeConcini said he planned to follow up on the offer. Bringing Two Children to U.S. The Congressional delegation returned today to Bangkok, Thailand, and plans to head back to Washington on Tuesday by way of Anchorage.  Two Vietnamese children will be aboard their Air Force C-135 jetliner. Acting on Senator Murkowski's appeal, Vietnam released Nguyen Van Chinh, a 10-year-old boy, and Tran Thanh Quynh, a 9-year-old girl, so they could be reunited with their mother, whom they have not seen in seven years.  Their mother, Xuan Thi Nguyen, 35, is now married to an American aircraft mechanic in Fairbanks, Alaska.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 19 1986 ,11

"   , Thailand, Feb. 15   A group of American members of Congress said today that Vietnamese officials had acknowledged for the first time that missing Americans might be living inside Vietnam, in remote areas not under full Government control.  They said Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son had told them that three Vietnamese teams were investigating reported sightings of Americans and had invited the United States to take part.  The members of Congress, who came here after two days in the Vietnamese capital, said Vietnamese officials also promised to return the bodies of 14 more Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War and had increased to 70 the number of missing on whom they promised reports.  ''For the first time, the Vietnamese Government is investigating a large number of live sightings,'' said Representative Gerald B. Solomon, Republican of Upstate New York, who is leading the nine-member House of Representatives task force on missing Americans and prisoners of war in Southeast Asia.  Hanoi's Position Is Modified  ''For years, Vietnam maintained that no live Americans were in Vietnam,'' he said at a news conference. ''They later changed that to say there were no live Americans under their control. But now they have moved to the position where they say that there could be live Americans that they are unaware of.''  Mr. Solomon, who met for three hours with Mr. Hoang, said the Foreign Minister had stressed that Vietnam was not holding any Americans against their will.  Another delegation member, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of Upstate New York, said the Vietnamese had indicated that there might be Americans living in the mountains or other remote areas not under full Government control.  Representative Solomon said, ''They have invited the U.S. Government as well to participate in any of these investigations, and I think that is most significant.'' #2,441 on Missing List A total of 2,441 Americans are listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War, including 1,797 missing in Vietnam and the rest in Laos and Cambodia.  Since the United States withdrew its military forces from Indochina in 1973, there have been 806 reported ''live sightings'' of Americans in the region, most by refugees, according to Federal Government records. Federal officials say they have discounted all but 95 reports.  Representative Bob Dornan, Republican of California, said he believed Vietnam might be holding Americans to make use of their technical knowledge.  Representative Bill Hendon, Republican of North Carolina, said there was a '''great deal'' of intelligence information indicating that Americans remained in remote areas of Vietnam, but he did not elaborate.  Vietnam said early last month that it had collected about 50 new reports of missing Americans and would turn them over soon. The Congressmen said Hanoi officials have promised to hand over information on 20 additional cases, for a total of about 70.  Meanwhile, Mr. Dornan announced that the bodies of eight American servicemen recently returned by the Vietnamese have been identified by the United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, the military organization responsible for resolving cases of the missing. ---- No U.S. Comment on Sightings WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 - A State Department spokesman said today that there would be no comment on the findings of the Congressional delegation.  ''The U.S. has investigated every report of live sightings of Americans,'' the spokesman said. ''So far we have not been able to prove that Americans prisoners of war remain in Indochina. We cannot rule out the possibility that there are live American prisoners there, however. So we proceed on the assumption that some Americans may be held.''

The officer, Lieut. Col. Paul Mather, who returned from the excavation of a crash site in Laos, said an American-Laotian team had dug up the AC-130 gunship it was seeking. The gunship was shot down in March 1972 with 14 American airmen aboard. Colonel Mather said at a news conference: ''We got some specific information back on these 49 cases they've investigated.

"   , Vietnam   After years of hesitancy and disagreement within the Vietnamese Communist Party, Hanoi now appears to be committed to major reforms in almost every area of the nation's economic life.  ''We consider this a revolution in our country,'' Hong Ha, the editor of the People's Daily, the party newspaper, said in a recent interview. In a strongly worded New Year's Day editorial, the People's Daily cited ''many errors and shortcomings'' in the country's economic management, and said there were a ''string of burning problems'' that had to be tackled this year.  The task will be a large one. With a per capita income of between $120 and $160, according to the best international estimates, Vietnam ranks among the world's poorest nations, falling steadily behind most of its Asian neighbors.  Mr. Ha, a youthful-looking 57-year-old party central committee member who was wearing a stylish cavalry twill suit, pastel shirt and fashionable woolen tie when he met reporters in his well-furnished office, said that the increased production of consumer goods - including textiles, paper and bicycle parts - would be one of this year's economic priorities.  Peasants Need Materials  ''The peasants are also demanding building materials,'' he added.  But more fundamental than what Vietnam hopes to produce, Mr. Ha said, was how this production would be carried out. He said the country needed new economic management to monitor cost effectiveness, productivity and quality control.  Woefully inadequate communcation and transportation systems, an absence of reliable statistics, unworkable and discouraging investment practices and even the country's tight security net would have to be reassessed, he said.  ''We have to be more dynamic,'' he said.  The Communists' Sixth Party Congress, called for the end of this year, will have to endorse changes, pressed by the country's chief planner, Vo Van Kiet, to make them official. But already there are sure signs that the measures are being taken seriously.  Several Western reporters who recently visited Hanoi and toured the countryside - where some agricultural reforms are already being tested - heard officials and farmers alike using phrases such as ''cost analysis,'' ''streamlined labor forces'' and ''consumer demand.'' But with one eye on the party hardliners, they also talk about ''socialist accounting'' and describe saving money as a ''revolutionary activity.''  The Vietnamese say their models - particularly for incentive systems and encouraging private initiative -are Moscow, Hungary or East Germany, noting that many young Vietnamese work, or are educated, in Soviet bloc countries.  Watching Peking  Foreign diplomats here say Hanoi has been watching Peking's progress very carefully. Just as in China, the Vietnamese say, farmers here are beginning to improve their lives at a rate unknown to city dwellers. Under a five-year-old experimental ''contract'' system of farming, production of foodstuffs over an agreed amount can be disposed of by the individual farmer or his cooperative.  Reporters visiting a cooperative farm in Hai Hung province were told how each farmer is also entitled to grow crops of his choosing on 5 percent of the land he works for the cooperative. Produce and meat from private plots is sold at busy markets in rural towns. In variety and freshness of food, a meal in the countryside beats anything Hanoi's best hotels can offer.  Vietnam's planners have also been watching the trade patterns of Southeast Asia's prosperous non-Communist neighbors, as some of these countries - Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand in particular -find their overseas markets shrinking in a slower world economy.  Regional Trade  Hanoi - or more often Ho Chi Minh City, the former South Vietnamese capital of Saigon, which retains some economic independence - has been having some success at increasing trade with regional countries looking for new markets, despite an official boycott linked to Vietnam's continued occupation of Cambodia.  Recent figures from the Thai Farmers' Bank, one of Thailand's leading financial institutions, show that Singapore's business community had almost doubled trade with Vietnam between 1980 and 1984, from $67 million to $120 million. And an air cargo service was recently started between the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City.  There is no way to measure the additional income in smuggled goods. Many of the luxury items that find their way to Hanoi come from Bangkok or Singapore. Imported beer and whisky found in hotels catering to foreigners frequently bear the label ''Singapore duty not paid.''  The Japanese, whose Government also professes to follow an official embargo on aid, recently held a trade fair in Ho Chi Minh City for 18 private companies. The companies selling what one diplomat here described as exactly the kind of machinery the Vietnamese need in this stage of development: rice-harvesting equipment, small hydro units and power generators and other simple, but critical, technology.  Japanese Seek Longer Stay  Japanese businessmen, who now get three-to-six-month visas from Hanoi, are hoping to be able to move in permanently next year, a diplomat said.  Vietnam's biggest drawbacks to increased trade, diplomats say, include its lack of hard-currency reserves to pay for imports or buy needed technology, a poor transportation system and what one foreign resident of Hanoi decribed as ''no sense at all of how to make a profit.''  ''What Vietnam has not got,'' this European said, ''is a cadre of highly educated, free-market economists -usually American trained - like those who have guided development in the rest of Asia.''

"    For the first time in years, a Defense Department investigation has found that Vietnam may indeed still hold American prisoners of war. At least that is the assessment of Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., a former Director of Defense Intelligence who headed a five-month review of intelligence files on the issue. The general said last week that ''a large volume of evidence'' - mainly ''live sightings'' reported by Vietnamese refugees - points to the likelihood that Americans are still imprisoned by Hanoi.  But the current Director of Defense Intelligence was more cautious. At a news conference a day after General Tighe's remarks, Lieut. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots contended that, while the investigation pointed to the ''strong possibility'' that some Americans remain alive in Vietnam 14 years after the United States pulled out, there was no ''strong compelling evidence'' to prove it. And General Perroots, who appointed the investigative panel, refused to speculate on whether Hanoi still holds Americans prisoner or whether Americans had voluntarily remained in Southeast Asia.  Veterans' groups and families of the missing have argued that Washington has not done enough to find out what happened to the 2,430 Americans who remain unaccounted for in Indochina. Although the Vietnamese Government has repeatedly denied holding prisoners, it said earlier this year that Americans may be living in remote parts of the country.  The Pentagon announced late last week that American and Vietnamese officials would meet in Hanoi this week to talk about the missing Americans. It will be the fourth such conference this year and the eighth since the Vietnamese agreed in March 1985 to discuss the issue.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 5 1986 ,11
"    BITTER VICTORY By Robert Shaplen. 309 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $16.95.  ROBERT SHAPLEN came to Indochina sooner than most of us, and he has stayed with it longer than most of us, too. He first visited Saigon in 1946 for Newsweek magazine; he was among the last Americans to leave the city in 1975, with the Communists at its gates; and he was permitted by the authorities in Hanoi to spend five weeks traveling in Vietnam and a week traveling in Cambodia in the autumn of 1984. ''Bitter Victory'' is an account of what he saw and heard on that journey, reporting for The New Yorker, as well as an analysis of the complex political and economic situation in Southeast Asia. It is enriched by the kind of perspective that few writers and even fewer policy makers can bring to the subject.  In Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon is now known, Mr. Shaplen encountered numberless Amerasian youngsters, many of them teen-agers, who were ostracized by the Vietnamese. Under the present quota approved by the United States of only 250 a month, it will take more than a decade for all of these children of Vietnamese mothers and American fathers to reach the United States. North of the capital, Mr. Shaplen visited the area that we used to call the Iron Triangle because it was so strongly fortified. (It was there, on Christmas Day, 1966, that Bob Hope entertained troops of the United States 25th Infantry Division while directly beneath him, in the tunnels that underlay the entire district, a Vietnamese singer entertained enemy guerrilla units.) Local officials told how they foiled each new American effort to uncover the tunnels, using pepper, for example, to drive away the dogs the G.I.'s used. And in Danang, the old Marine base in central Vietnam, which had shrunk to half its wartime size, Mr. Shaplen made the somehow pleasing discovery (to me, anyway) that our ramshackle press camp has been turned into a shrimp cannery.  It was in Hanoi, however, that Mr. Shaplen's trip paid its richest rewards, for he was able to talk at length not only to Le Duc Tho, the number two man in the party hierarchy - who told him that he was the first American he had met since concluding his negotiations with Henry Kissinger in Paris in 1972 - but also to a number of other Vietnamese who had played key roles during and since the war. On the basis of those conversations, the author concluded that the leadership in Hanoi has decided it must wind down the war in Cambodia if it is to achieve what he terms its two greatest goals - a rapprochement with the United States that would lessen the country's almost total dependence on the Soviet Union, and an easing of tensions with China. He also concluded that the precarious economic and social situation the Vietnamese find themselves in, a decade after the end of the war, is mostly their own fault, the result of what he terms ''a crippling inability to create unity among themselves and to reach out to others, including their neighbors in Southeast Asia, in a spirit of friendship and compromise.'' More than anything else, Mr. Shaplen argues, it is Hanoi's failure to adjust to postwar reality that has doomed the Vietnamese to the abysmal poverty they also knew 10 and 20 and 30 years ago, despite all their sacrifices during the last 40 years and all the potential riches of their country.  Yet despite his title, Mr. Shaplen also sees scattered signs of hope. The (temporary?) ascendancy of the pragmatists over the ideologues in the Vietnamese Politburo, he thinks, offers at least a chance of resolving the conflict between the ''soft'' south and ''hard'' north, and perhaps even of evolving a variant of socialism as well adapted to the individualism of the Vietnamese as the Kadar version is to the energy and acquisitiveness of the Hungarians. He is too optimistic; by this spring, inflation was once again rampant, pork and rice were scarce and industry was running at less than half capacity because of energy shortages. MUCH the most gripping part of a book that sometimes loses its way in the fogs of diplomatic speculation, especially where Cambodia is concerned, deals with the Vietnamese view of the war against the Americans. It is fascinating, for example, that the senior military historian in Hanoi argues that the two key battles in that conflict took place before the arrival of the first United States combat units in 1965; and it is stirring, whatever one's attitude to the war, to read of the sustained heroism that made possible the construction, expansion and operation of the Ho Chi Minh trail. The details are awesome: 30,000 men at work on the trail at its busiest, 10,000 tons of freight carried every week, thousands of miles of roadway completely covered by trees and vines braided to form a canopy. Without the trail, the Vietnamese say, they would have lost.  The generals to whom Mr. Shaplen talked all but admitted that, as the American command contended at the time, they suffered disproportionate and temporarily crippling losses in the 1968 Tet offensive, but they considered them acceptable because of the political victory represented by President Johnson's subsequent decision to leave office.  Mr. Shaplen for the most part dismisses the revisionist view that earlier or bolder attacks on Cambodia or Hanoi or the Ho Chi Minh trail might have changed the outcome of the war. His most telling witness is retired Maj. Gen. Dinh Duc Thien, the wartime North Vietnamese logistics chief, who is quoted as having told the author: ''Even if you had destroyed Hanoi, bombed it flat, we would still have gone into the countryside. . . . An industrial country cannot defeat an agricultural nation by bombing.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of Robert Shaplen  TYPE: Review                      ",October 5 1986 ,11

"   , Thailand, Oct. 25   Hanoi's new Communist Party leader, in a series of tough speeches over the last week setting the agenda for a party congress, is portraying Vietnam as a troubled country that has squandered its material and human potential through its own mistakes.  In speeches to preliminary party meetings held by the army and the City of Hanoi, the party leader, Truong Chinh, who replaced Le Duan as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam in July, attacked economic policy and described in harsh terms the consequent problems of corruption, unemployment and a dispirited and deprived population.  ''Prices fluctuate wildly, and life is unstable,'' he was reported to have said last Sunday. ''Negativism has developed, traditional ethical and spiritual values are eroded and socioeconomic activities are thrown into prolonged chaos, causing widespread doubt about the future and a lack of confidence in the party's leadership.''  He told his audience that these were matters to consider at a party conference that Vietnamese officials have suggested will be held around the end of the year, although no date has been announced.  Excerpts from the speeches have been repeatedly broadcast all week by the Hanoi radio, in English for foreign audiences and in full-text Vietnamese versions for domestic listeners.  The remarks by Mr. Chinh reflect in part the calls for ''renovation'' of the Communist system made by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  ''Socialism must strive to prove its all-round superiority over capitalism,'' said Mr. Chinh, 79 years old, a member of the Ho Chi Minh generation of hard-line Communists.  But his criticism drew attention to ''great difficulties'' that have held back Vietnam's development in the years it has been under the tutelage of Moscow.  Diplomats in the region appear divided on whether Hanoi believes it has received the wrong kind of aid or whether Moscow has concluded its assistance has been squandered. When Mr. Chinh went to the Soviet Union for a meeting in August, his reception was described as less than enthusiastic.  Hanoi, diplomats say, has been watching events in China very closely, while continuing to reject a radical move away from the Communist system. The leadership, which is still largely North Vietnamese, has also been influenced to some degree by the formerly free-enterprise South Vietnam, which remains the country's most dynamic region, according to Bangkok-based international economists. Several South Vietnamese officials are thought to be making their way into the country's ruling circles.  In addition, young Vietnamese tell visitors that they have been greatly impressed by the material progress they encounter when sent to study or work in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe, and this raises questions about why development has not kept pace in Vietnam.  Speaking to a Hanoi party audience, Mr. Chinh appeared to confirm what visitors to Hanoi have noticed for the first time over the last year: a growing and outspoken public disenchantment with both the policies and the practices of government. Speaking to the army, the party leader also called for more ''material and morale support for the front line.''  More than 11 years after the end of the Vietnam War, the country, now at war in Cambodia, remains one of the world's poorest nations, falling farther and farther behind its non-Communist Southeast Asian neighbors.  Mr. Chinh singled out for special attack in talks to both military and political audiences the policy of concentrating on heavy industry at the expense of crafts and cottage industries or expanded commodities production.  Many of Vietnam's largest projects, in industry and energy, have been developed with Soviet aid and advice. Mr. Chinh's rejection of ''doing things on a larger scale than our capability permits'' is interpreted by some diplomats in the region as an expression of annoyance with the poor results of more than a decade of dependence in Moscow for development.

"   , Thailand, Oct. 29   Four United States military specialists went to Hanoi today for technical talks aimed at resolving the status of 1,786 Americans listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War, which ended in 1975.  The talks, the fourth round this year, had been set for Oct. 8, but were suddenly canceled by Vietnam with no explanation. The technical talks began in December 1982.

The Vietnamese side is headed by Nguyen Can, head of a Foreign Ministry office for resolving the question.  Washington and Hanoi do not have diplomatic relations.  One American goal in the talks is to win an agreement on a second United States-Vietnamese excavation of a warplane crash site to search for remains.

Before the devaluation, the dollar (pegged officially at 15 dong since September 1985) had been buying up to 430 dong on the black market, according to residents of Hanoi.

"   , Thailand, Dec. 14   Vietnam's Communist leaders meet this week in a crucial party congress that they say will have to set a new course for the country if Hanoi is to overcome debilitating economic and political problems.  The party congress, the third since the unification of the country in 1975, is expected to start naming a new generation of national leaders, the first in half a century. Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries - partly through its own mistakes, its leaders concede - may also commit itself to new economic policies.  ''The Vietnamese people are at a new stage of their revolution,'' an announcer for the Voice of Vietnam said Saturday, as she described preparations for the congress, which opens Monday.

The official radio announced that hundreds of thousands of petitions have come in from citizens around the country, citing problems in need of attention.  ''The party continues to secure many important achievements,'' a domestic broadcast said on Dec. 7. ''But it has been and is meeting with numerous great difficulties and committing many serious shortcomings that erode the people's confidence.  ''Although there have been many motivation drives to build up the party against negativism, they have failed to bring about the desired results,'' the program, reviewing articles in the magazine Tap Chi Cong San, said. The broadcast was monitored and translated by the British Broadcasting Corporation.  ''The scourge of corruption continues to develop widely in various forms,'' it said. ''Party discipline and state law has deteriorated to an unprecedented degree.''  'Odious' Trends Attacked  A week earlier, an editorial in the Vietnamese Army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan bitterly attacked what it called ''odious'' trends in society. It went on to spell out the problem.  ''These negative phenomena,'' it said, ''consist of acts of speculation for gainful purpose, corruption and graft, misappropriation of public property, officialism, arrogance, bribe-taking, and undisciplined lifestyle, liberalism, lack of responsibility, disrespect for the law, disruption of order, lack of civilization, disregard for fine customs, and more.''  The possible role of the army in forcing change has been a matter of speculation in Southeast Asia and among scholars in the United States. Regular readers of Vietnamese military publications say there may be growing military dissatisfaction with the country's underdevelopment and with the conduct of the nine-year-old war in Cambodia.  The name of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the strategist in wars against both the French and Americans, has reappeared after a period of some obscurity. Some diplomats in Hanoi said they believed that General Giap, who apparently questioned the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, may now be among the candidates to succeed Pham Van Dong as Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister, who is 80 years old and very frail, has indicated he wants to retire.  Party Leader to Be Chosen  The most important development expected at the congress will be the announcement of a new party leader to follow Le Duan, a contemporary and successor of Ho Chi Minh. Mr. Duan, who died in July, was temporarily replaced by Truong Chinh, 79. Observers now think Mr. Chinh may intend to stay on.  In series of tough speeches this fall, Mr. Chinh, a former leftist radical whose forced collectivization program was thought to have resulted in many deaths in the 1950's, joined those calling for ''renovation'' of the economy.  Among other figures mentioned often enough in Vietnamese news reports to suggest they may be on the rise are Nguyen Van Linh, a southerner who was removed from the Politburo in 1982 and then reinstated last year without explanation, and Vo Van Kiet, the country's embattled economic planner, whose earlier changes met resistance.  Vo Chi Tong, now Deputy Prime Minister and the author of popular agricultural policies that rewarded farmers' initiative, is another possible candidate for Prime Minister or other top post.  Sharp Change Unlikely  But diplomats caution against expecting too sharp a change in policy from the party congress. The country's Communist Party, with 1.8 million members, remains at heart ideologically orthodox, an orthodoxy solidified and never seriously challenged through two wars.  In addition, most new leaders likely to emerge this week are men well into their 60's or 70's.  Only in peacetime, and only in the last year or two, has there been any noticeable display of public discontent in Vietnam, north as well as south. The depth and danger of this discontent is now being acknowledged in Hanoi.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 14 1986 ,11
"   , Thailand, Dec. 17   Vietnam announced the resignation of its three top leaders today.  The departure of the three - Prime Minister Pham Van Dong; Truong Chinh, the Communist Party's General Secretary, and Le Duc Tho, the Politburo member who led Hanoi's team in negotiating the United States withdrawal from Vietnam - marks the most dramatic political change in 56 years of party history and more than three decades of independence.  Replacements are expected to be named Thursday at the closing session of the Sixth Communist Party Congress, now in its third day in Hanoi.  In a speech on Monday to the opening session, Mr. Chinh suggested that a ''purification'' or purge of the party might follow this week's meeting.  The resignations in effect bring to an end a half-century of unbroken control of the Vietnamese Communist Party -and later Hanoi's Communist Government - by the remarkable band of revolutionaries who formed around Ho Chi Minh, the party's founder, in the 1920's and 1930's. Ho died in 1969.  It is too early to determine whether policy changes will follow. Vietnam acknowledges that it faces serious economic problems and a crisis of confidence in its political leadership. Hanoi is also involved in a difficult and unpopular war in Cambodia, according to defectors from the Vietnamese Army and disgruntled citizens in both the north and the south.  According to the official Voice of Vietnam, the three leaders are retiring because of ''old age and health conditions.'' They will, however, become ''advisers'' to the Central Committee, according to the broadcast, which added that they would be able ''to contribute further to the collective wisdom of the party.''  Vietnam has barred most Western reporters from the country during the party congress. According to the Vietnamese Embassy here, 14 reporting visas were granted, most of them to television crews from Japan, Australia and Britain. American newspapers are represented by The Associated Press.  Possible Contenders  The three names most often mentioned as contenders for Mr. Chinh's job as party leader are Nguyen Van Linh, 73 years old, a former party secretary in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon; Vo Chi Cong, 73, a Deputy Prime Minister, and Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the military stragetist behind the wars against France and the United States. General Giap, who diplomats say questioned Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978, has been in eclipse for several years.  The three leaders' decision not to run for re-election to the party's Central Committee was announced today by Interior Minister Pham Hung, another member of the founding generation.  The broadcast said the congress had honored the three men ''for great services rendered to the party and people of Vietnam.'' Witnesses said the three then waved goodbye to their fellow party members.  Mr. Dong (pronounced DOME), who is 80 and very frail, had been expected to retire. But the departures of Mr. Chinh, 79, and Mr. Tho, 76, surprised many diplomats and scholars.  Mr. Chinh, who became leader of the party - and in effect of the country -after the death of Le Duan in July, had recently been described as looking fit. Since early fall, he appeared to be leading the ''self-criticism'' campaign that acknowledged the country's problems to audiences at home and abroad.  Mr. Tho, a cosmopolitan but often apparently humorless man, had often been suggested as a candidate for one of the country's highest posts.  Factions in Leadership  According to Thai Quang Trung, a Vietnamese-born, Paris-educated exile historian of the party, the removal of Mr. Chinh and Mr. Tho at the same time may be an attempt to deal evenhandedly with two persistent factions of the party leadership, roughly described a pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese.  In a monograph written for Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Mr. Trung described Mr. Chinh as spokesman for a northern sector of the party influenced by Mao Zedong. Mr. Tho, a southerner whom Mr. Trung believed to be the leader the pro-Moscow wing, had been a rival of Mr. Chinh for decades.  Truong Chinh - a pseudonym meaning ''long march'' that he adopted as a young man when most of his associates were under the influence of the Chinese Communist movement - had been an advocate of radical agricultural change in the 1950's. When his forced collectivization plans cost many Vietnamese lives and considerable eonomic damage, he was pushed to the background of the party hierarchy.  Urged 'Prolonged War'  He had also advocated a ''prolonged war'' in what was then South Vietnam, rather than the quicker and more decisive military action urged by Mr. Tho.  As the war against the pro-Western South ended with a sudden North Vietnamese military sweep in 1975 and Hanoi was drawn into the orbit of Moscow, Mr. Chinh's future seemed unpromising.  But Vietnam, unlike many other Communist nations, did not experience cataclysmic leadership splits. So Mr. Chinh was eventually rehabilitated. Mr. Duan, whom he succeeded as leader, was considered by many to be a pro-Moscow man.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 17 1986 ,11
"   , Thailand, Dec. 18   A 73-year-old political administrator who built his career as Hanoi's representative in the south before and after the takeover of Saigon was named head of the Communist Party of Vietnam today.  The election of Nguyen Van Linh to the top party post was announced in Hanoi during the closing session of the Sixth Communist Party Congress. It makes him the country's most powerful figure and the first ruler not to be a member of Ho Chi Minh's inner circle.  Mr. Linh replaces Truong Chinh, whose resignation as General Secretary of the party was announced Wednesday as part of the most sweeping reorganization of the party leadership in half a century. Five of 13 Politburo members have lost their seats in the last two days.  Mr. Linh, a figure little known outside Vietnamese Communist Party circles, is frequently associated with a group of economic pragmatists, many of them with experience in the south, who have advocated some liberalization of the economy.  Significance Not Yet Clear  But the congress did not produce bold new economic policies, and most experts say it is therefore too early to say whether Vietnam has been turned over to a generation of reformers.  In other changes announced today, Vietnam's Defense Minister, Senior Gen. Van Tien Dung, was dropped from the Politburo. He will lose his ministerial position.  No reason was given for General Dung's departure from a job he held since 1980, the year after Vietnam toppled the Government of its neighbor, Cambodia. Ever since, Cambodia has been the site of an inconclusive war with which General Dung and Le Duc Tho, who was dropped from the Politburo yesterday, have been associated.  The name of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the hero of Dien Bien Phu and the war against South Vietnam, was missing from today's Politburo appointments. He was returned to the Central Committee rather than being named, as expected, to a higher party post after having spent several years on the fringes of power.  A Rise in Status  However, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach rose from the position of Politburo alternate to its eighth-ranking member.  Vietnamese officials would not comment on whether Mr. Thach, who is well known abroad, might leave the ministry for other government tasks. But one official pointed out that Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son had joined the party's Central Committee, a steppingstone to higher office.  Another official who has promoted economic changes, the state planning director, Vo Van Kiet, moved up from tenth place in the hierarchy to fifth.  One newcomer to the Politburo was Mai Chi Tho, the brother of Le Duc Tho. Mai Chi Tho had been mayor and party secretary in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, and is considered one of Vietnam's leading experts on state security.  Nguyen Thanh Binh, secretary of the Hanoi party committee, also joined the Politburo, as did Gen. Doan Khue, who had been First Deputy Minister of Defense.   Prime Ministership Still Vacant  Although no one was named today to fill the Prime Minister's position vacated Wednesday by Pham Van Dong, the veteran revolutionary, the rankings in the new Politburo list indicate that the job may go to Vo Chi Cong, now a Deputy Prime Minister.  Mr. Cong moved up from seventh place on the Politburo list to third. He is separated from the top position by Pham Hung, the last of Ho Chi Minh's inner circle, who is reported to have declined the prime ministership.  Government ministries, as distinct from party positions, are to be allocated when the National Assembly meets, probably in the last week of the year, officials say.  Mr. Cong, who was formerly Agriculture Minister, has been an advocate of more incentives for farmers as a means of raising food production. Increased food supply has been made one of the top policy priorities at the congress, along with the production of more consumer goods and the development of more export industries to earn hard currency.  A Need for Development  Vietnam is suffering severe economic problems and needs capital and technology for development. Western nations and Japan have withheld aid since Hanoi invaded Cambodia.  The appointment of Mr. Linh (pronounced LING) to the country's top post was widely expected, and seemed to be confirmed when he gave the opening speech of the congress on Monday.  Mr. Linh, who was born in Hanoi, made his reputation in the 1960's and 1970's as North Vietnam's top official with Vietcong forces in South Vietnam during the war against American forces and the Saigon Government.  After the war Mr. Linh returned to Hanoi, where he was appointed to the party's Central Committee and Politburo in 1976. Within a few years he was back in the south as party chief in Ho Chi Minh City.  A year later, Mr. Linh stepped down from the Politburo and the party's administrative body, the Secretariat. Some scholars believe he may have been moved aside because he had failed to reorganize the south fast enough.  While in the south, Mr. Linh became identified with economic measures that were designed to decentralize decision-making and to use material incentives to stimulate production.  As more members of the leadership were coming to hold similar views, Mr. Linh returned to the Politburo in 1985, perhaps vindicated.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 18 1986 ,11
"    So far only the faces are different in Vietnam, but policy changes could be next. If these bring relaxation of control at home and in Cambodia, they could be of enormous importance to the people of Indochina and open some interesting opportunities in the Soviet-Chinese-American triangle.  Economic reformers dominate the new leadership lineup announced at this week's Communist Party Congress. Vietnam has been mired in deep poverty, the price of doctrinaire Communism and aggression in Cambodia. The Vietnamese people need relief.  As for foreign relations, the new team might be ready to rethink policy toward Cambodia. Vietnam's military occupation of that country has been long and frightful, and fuels a deadly civil war. Hanoi's insistence on retaining control of Cambodia is the main reason the world has isolated Vietnam.  If the new leaders would shift the focus to development, they could reassess their present dependence on the Soviet Union. The Russians provide them, as an anti-Chinese ally, about $1 billion yearly. For Vietnam to leave Cambodia would allow repositioning between Moscow and Peking and help to open the door with Washington as well.  The party congress, the first since the death last summer of the veteran Communist leader Le Duan, designated Nguyen Van Linh as party chief, and replaced 5 of the 13 politburo members. Mr. Linh, the new party leader, was Hanoi's top official in South Vietnam before and after unification. His familiarity with the South's more open economic style made him an advocate of economic decentralization and raising production through material incentives rather than ideological exhortations. These views were resisted in the past and only the announcement of a new economic program will show how far Hanoi is prepared to go now. Nevertheless, the promotion of other leading economic reformers is a positive sign.  A hint of a possible change on Cambodia comes from the retirement of both Le Duc Tho and Gen. Van Tien Dung, two leaders closely linked to present policies. Economic revival virtually depends on reversing those policies, which have drained resources and provoked a cutoff of Western and Japanese assistance.  Vietnam's revolutionary cadres endured years of sacrifice, sustained by dreams of development and nationalist glory. Instead, they have reaped underdevelopment and dependence on support from Hanoi's only ally, the Soviet Union. If Vietnam's new leaders seek a constructive way out of the mess and provide more information about Americans missing in action and related issues, Washington should be ready to pay heed and encourage a welcome trend. Policy made in Vietnam can still reverberate in the largest capitals.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",December 20 1986 ,11
"   , Thailand, Dec. 22   Vietnam's poor economic performance was the overriding concern of Hanoi's governing Communists when they assembled last week for their Sixth Party Congress. But it is not the only problem to which the country's new leaders are giving immediate attention, records of the meetings indicate.  As diplomats and scholars begin to sift through voluminous speeches, articles and the comments of Vietnamese officials, they say it is apparent that the leadership faces factionalism within the party, a disgruntled army and, most important, a south that is still wayward and uncooperative. The south, in the view of some Hanoi officials, is the source of corruption, political deviation and ''many-faceted sabotage.''  ''South Vietnam is in a state of moral secession,'' the party historian Thai Quang Trung, who is based in Paris, said in a meeting with journalists in Bangkok on Friday.  Mr. Trung, an exile who is critical of Hanoi, said that within Vietnam the situation in the south was now being described by the Vietnamese aphorism, ''One thousand pounds hanging by a hair.''  A Sign of Deference  According to Douglas Pike, the head of the Indochina Studies Program at the University of California at Berkeley and the editor of the periodical Indochina Chronology, the naming of Nguyen Van Linh as party chief is ''a clear sign of deference to the south.''  Mr. Linh, who replaced Truong Chinh as General Secretary of the party on Thursday, served for more than 40 years in southern Vietnam. He was first an underground Communist organizer, then a liaison with the southern-based Vietcong, which officials now decribe as a wing of Hanoi's Communist Party, and finally, after the fall of the south, an administrator of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  He was one of several important party officials with long experience in the south who were promoted during the congress last week or are expected, according to officials, to take high posts when the country's new Government lineup, as distinct from party lineup, is announced, probably before the end of the year.  The others include Pham Hung, the second-ranking official in the party hierachy, who may become head of the State Council, or President; Vo Chi Cong, who is in line to become Prime Minister; Vo Van Kiet, the head of national planning, and Mai Chi Tho, a security expert who was a popular and effective mayor of Ho Chi Minh City. These men have also been associated with experiments in economic liberalization.  Curbs on Repression Seen  ''This may bring an end, or a scaling down, of more repressive measures against the south,'' Mr. Pike said in a telephone interview.  ''In 1975, Hanoi's initial instinct had been to go slow on the south,'' he said. ''But before the end of that year they decided to opt instead for total and immediate integration. 'Breaking the machine,' they called it. What you may be seeing now is a redressing of this.  ''They may have made the decision that they really need the south,'' Mr. Pike said. Mr. Trung believes that the Politburo is heavily weighted with people who are thought to know ''how to deal with southerners - capitalists, Buddhists, Catholics, all sorts of people.''  Vietnamese news organizations have begun to reflect a new attitude. A week ago, when Vo Tran Chi, the party secretary for Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, spoke to the Congress, the official Hanoi radio described the former southern capital as ''a dynamic example of economic development for provinces throughout the country,'' according to a translation by the monitoring service of the British Broadcasting Corporation.  Specific Economic Requests  Mr. Chi then proceeded to give a speech almost free of jargon and very specific in its economic requests -more electricity to power a recovery, for example, and more qualified personnel to speed development.  If the south can finally be pacified, while contributing its agricultural, manufacturing and management skills to national development, experts say, the new leadership of Hanoi will have a major achievement to its credit.  Problems with the army have some roots in the economy, according to military publications. Both Mr. Trung and Mr. Pike, the author of a new history, ''P.A.V.N.: People's Army of Vietnam,'' believe that the army is probably the country's strongest and least divided institution at this point, and that its concerns must be addressed.  Early this month, a few days before the opening of the party congress, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, the army daily newspaper, complained of a lack of attention to the needs of troops. It portrayed a fighting force facing China that lacked warm clothes and lived on boiled potatoes while sleeping in crowded tents.  Morale Has Declined  In Cambodia, where officials have acknowledged problems of indiscipline and desertion compounded by malaria and many casualties from land mines, morale has declined, military pubications say.  Diplomats and other observers of the Vietnamese military are not convinced, however, that the departure from the Politburo last week of the country's Defense Minister, Senior Gen. Van Tien Dung, reflects problems between the party and army. His removal is thought by some to have a strictly political cause.  General Dung was thought to be close to Le Duc Tho, who also lost his Politburo seat last week, and to Le Duan, the party General Secretary who died in July. Mr. Chinh, who replaced Mr. Duan, had been a bitter rival of his predecessor for many years. Mr. Linh, who now takes over, was a protege of Mr. Chinh, and therefore it is thought that he may have helped engineer the dismissal of General Dung as Defense Minister.  Scholars say the existence of continued party factionalism is hard to prove. But Mr. Trung said some evidence, which he did not provide in detail, is emerging from Hanoi that indicates that Mr. Chinh made a last-minute attempt to keep the top party post but lost both that bid and a subsequent one to stay in the Politburo.  According to Mr. Trung's analysis, a deadlock over Mr. Chinh's future was broken by the simultaneous resignation of Mr. Chinh and Le Duc Tho, who was considered an ally of Le Duan.  Pham Van Dong, the country's Prime Minister, who also resigned, was in ill health and had been expected to retire.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 23 1986 ,11
"   , Thailand, Dec. 24   An important session of Vietnam's National Assembly opened today in Hanoi, according to the official radio, the Voice of Vietnam.  The assembly is expected to name the country's President and Prime Minister. But the Vietnamese Embassy here said there was no published timetable for this assembly session, which follows the Sixth Communist Party Congress last week. The official radio, heard in Bangkok tonight, also did not mention a schedule.  Over the last few days there have been reports from Hanoi suggesting that there are still disagreements within the party over appointments and policies. The pace and scope of economic change have been a major issue in Vietnam since the last party congress in 1982.  According to Agence France-Presse, the only Western news organization with a bureau in Hanoi, there has been a report in the Vietnamese Party theoretical journal suggesting that ''revolutionary violence'' will have to been applied to certain problem factions.  The Sixth Party Congress named a new party leader, Nguyen Van Linh. It also elected a new Politburo, the composition of which normally provides strong clues to who will take over top governmental positions, which are dominated by the party hierarchy.  It had been predicted by diplomats and officials in Hanoi last week that the presidency of the Council of Ministers, still held by Truong Chinh, who relinquished the party leadership position last week, would go to Pham Hung.

"   , Vietnam, April 10   Vietnam today turned over to the United States the bodies of 21 people believed to be missing American servicemen. It was the first repatriation of war dead this year and the third largest since 1975.  At Hanoi's international airport, an honor guard drawn from the four American military services escorted each coffin into a C-141 transport plane.  Hanoi used the occasion to warn the United States that the future of joint Vietnamese-United States efforts to resolve the issue of missing Americans could be in jeopardy.  Nguyen Can, the acting head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's North American Department, said the two-year deadline set last year by Hanoi for resolving the missing and prisoner of war issue cannot be met if there are what he called ''statements that vilify or discredit Vietnam in Washington.''

"   , Vietnam, April 12   Hanoi, saying it is disappointed that progress in the search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War has not elicited ''cooperation and good will'' from the United States, has suddenly shifted to a much harsher public stance toward Washington.  The shift, which comes after less than a year of improving relations, raises the possibility that efforts to determine the fate of more than 1,700 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam will be halted, according to Hanoi officials.  Recent public statements from Hanoi also indicate that the Vietnamese are becoming alarmed at signs of reinvigorated Thai-American military cooperation and the likelihood that more American support will be given to rebels fighting the Vietnamese-backed Government of Cambodia.  'A U.S. Comeback'  After Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger toured the Cambodian border area last Tuesday while on a visit to Thailand, the Vietnamese News Agency, envisioning what it called ''a U.S. comeback to Southeast Asia,'' said:  ''The military cooperation between Washington and Bangkok is increasing to the dangerous point of reopening U.S. military bases in Thailand. This dangerous policy of Bangkok is directly threatening the fundamental national interests of Thailand.''  On Thursday, Vietnam turned over to the United States the remains of 21 people believed to be missing American servicemen. It was the first repatriation of war dead this year and the third largest since 1975.  But in a meeting with reporters today, Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son said that ''in the absence of cooperation and goodwill from the United States, a lot of obstacles could be created'' in the search for missing Americans.  The Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan has recently begun to attack American officials for what it said were statements indicating the United States was ''ready to use force, if necessary, to free any American prisoners'' in Vietnam. The attacks were apparently a reaction to testimony in Congress by Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, who said the United States would take ''appropriate action'' if it was determined that the Vietnamese Government was holding Americans in Vietnam.  Another article in Nhan Dan criticized the State Department for saying there were violations of human rights in Vietnam. The newspaper called the annual human rights report a ''brazen slander and a manifestation of the U.S. hostile attitude toward the Vietnamese people.''  ''The Washington authorities,'' the article said, ''have spent large amounts of money for propaganda campaigns against Vietnam, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in hopes of covering up the fact that they themselves are the most brazen violators of human rights in the world.''  Mr. Son, charging that the United States has rejected two sets of Vietnamese proposals for a joint agreement on solving the missing-in-action issue, today called for a written accord between the two nations. He declined to elaborate on what was in the proposals, but the Vietnamese have long sought a two-year timetable for completion of outstanding missing-persons cases.  The United States has rejected a written accord in the belief that this would hinder Washington from pursuing the issue after the time limit expired.  Mr. Son repeated a charge made earlier this week by Nguyen Can, head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's department of North American affairs, that suggestions by some Americans that the Hanoi Government was holding live Americans had slowed the search process. Hanoi denies that there are any living Americans in the country; Mr. Son said Saturday that he had been misquoted by members of an American delegation that visited Hanoi in February. The group, led by Mr. Armitage, had reported that Mr. Son said some Americans may be living in remote areas without Hanoi's knowledge.  A loss of momentum on this issue -coming less than a year after what Washington considered to be a breakthrough with Hanoi - would follow a pattern of ill-fated efforts to resolve problems between the two nations.  Among the now-stalemated questions are the Amerasian children and ''re-education'' camp inmates who the Reagan Administration has said it would be willing to resettle in the United States. Also stalled is the Orderly Departure Program, under which Vietnamese leave their country legally for the United States and other Western nations under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Causes and Consequences  Hanoi has always taken the position that its offer last summer to resolve the missing Americans issue ''within two years'' was strictly a humanitarian gesture.  But at the same time, diplomats say, the Vietnamese may have thought that a gesture of good will on their part would quickly be reciprocated by the Americans. Diplomats are almost unanimous in saying that Hanoi still puts a very high priority on getting United States diplomatic recognition.  Diplomats also suggest that the steady succession of delegations from the United States coming to Vietnam to discuss the issue of missing Americans might have left Hanoi officials with the impression that this issue was more important to the United States than the continuing Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.  The diplomats say it is the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia that has soured relations between Hanoi and most nations outside the Soviet bloc. The United States has taken the same position: that Cambodia is the ultimate issue.  A foreigner in Phnom Penh, however, said the Vietnamese are shrewd and experienced readers of American political signals, and may think it possible to extract concessions from Washington ''by playing the M.I.A. card.''

"    Three American theater artists, one of them a Vietnam War veteran, will visit Vietnam later this month in what they hope will be the beginning of a cultural exchange, the first between the United States and Vietnam since the fall of Saigon 11 years ago.  If the Vietnamese and American Governments permit the visit to be reciprocated, it is likely that some Vietnamese artists will perform this fall at Joseph Papp's Public Theater.  After four years of attempts and missed chances, the director Thomas Bird, the mime Bill Irwin and the writer-performer Spalding Gray received visas this week from Vietnam. They will enter Vietnam via Bangkok on April 27 or 28 and will depart after visits to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) on May 8.  Mr. Bird, the artistic director of the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company, served as an Army infantryman in Vietnam from August 1965 to August 1966. He has visited Vietnam twice since the end of the war -in 1981 as part of a delegation of veterans discussing such issues as Agent Orange and American soldiers who remained unaccounted for, and in 1982 on a more general visit with a delegation including Mr. Papp.  Trip 'Solely Cultural'  ''Exchanging culture and arts like this is a way of warming relations between our countries,'' Mr. Bird said yesterday. ''We will not be discussing anything political on this trip. It's solely a cultural trip.''  Tran Khanh, a press officer with the Vietnamese mission to the United Nations, said yesterday: ''The cultural exchange between Vietnam and the United States will be very beneficial to both sides. We hope that exchanges of this kind will increase our nations' understanding of each other.''  Mr. Bird said that the American delegation plans to meet with Nguyen Van Hieu, the Vietnamese minister of culture, and ''to see as much music and theater as we can,'' with an eye toward spotting individuals or arts groups that might be invited to perform in New York in the fall.  Mr. Irwin, a mime who won a MacArthur Foundation grant two years ago, will perform in Vietnam, Mr. Bird said. Mr. Bird is bringing copies of the play ''Tracers,'' which the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company developed and performed last year. And he said it is possible that Mr. Gray will perform portions of his monologue ''Swimming to Cambodia,'' which is now being translated into Vietnamese.  Circus Popular in Hanoi  Mr. Bird said he chose Mr. Gray to accompany him because when they played together in the film ''The Killing Fields,'' he discovered Mr. Gray's deep interest in Vietnam. Part of the monologue ''Swimming to Cambodia,'' in fact, concerns the two men's attempt in 1983 to attain a visa from the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok.  As for Mr. Irwin, Mr. Bird said, ''I thought of Bill because his work was nonverbal. He should go over well there, because I'm told one of the most popular things in Hanoi is the circus.''

"      Vietnam notified the United States today that it was suspending talks on resolving the question of Americans still listed as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, the State Department said.  In the official message to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Hanoi said ''the current situation is not favorable'' for holding the next meeting on the missing-in-action Americans that had been set for next Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi, Bernard Kalb, the department's spokesman, said.  But Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, at a meeting in New Delhi of the countries that describe themselves as nonaligned, said the discussions were being suspended because of the American air attacks on Libya.  The Hanoi move drew a quick warning from Washington. Mr. Kalb said this action would ''imperil any chance for improvement in the atmosphere between our two nations.''  Hanoi Pledge Cited  Noting that Hanoi had pledged last year to settle once and for all all questions dealing with the nearly 2,000 Americans still listed as unaccounted for in Vietnam, Mr. Kalb said:  ''If Vietnam now decides to abandon that pledge and to link this humanitarian enterprise to political issues, this can only increase the suffering of the families of those still missing, bring discredit to the Hanoi authorities and imperil any chance for an improvement in the atmosphere between our two nations.''  The Vietnamese have also apparently reneged on another pledge made to the United States - to turn over to the United States some 7,000 political prisoners who have been in so-called ''re-education camps.'' Many of these prisoners are Vietnamese with close ties to the United States, such as military and civilian officials in the former Saigon Government.  In 1984, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of Vietnam said Hanoi would release these prisoners if Washington would take them. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said then that the United States would take them and their relatives over a two-year period.  Report From Ex-Governor  A report made public today by a special panel on Indochinese refugees, headed by the former Governor of Iowa, Robert D. Ray, said that when the group visited Hanoi recently, ''Foreign Minister Thach was categorical in his refusal to discuss the issue, stating that it was now 'out of the question,' to release the prisoners.''  ''We found that there is great difficulty in getting cooperation or even getting them to acknowledge what they have previously said relative to the re-education camp prisoners,'' Mr. Ray said in a news conference today.  ''They refuse to call them prisoners,'' he said.  Although American officials dealing with the issue do not believe there are any Americans still alive, they would like to get more information from the Vietnamese on what happened to Americans who were known to have been captured during the war but who were never accounted for and to recover the remains of Americans from areas where there were known to be plane crashes.  The United States at the end of 1985 listed 1,797 Americans as unaccounted for in Vietnam, 700 in the north, and 1,097 in the south. In addition, 556 are listed as unaccounted for in Laos, 82 in Cambodia, and 6 in China, for a total of 2,441.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 19 1986 ,11
"    To the Editor:  Your article reporting a new chill from Hanoi in relations with the U.S. (front page, April 13) could just as well have spoken of a continued U.S. chill in relations with Vietnam. Having recently returned from a visit to Vietnam with a private U.S. humanitarian-aid delegation, and met with the two key Vietnamese officials you quote, as well as others, I find there is more to the story than reported.  Vietnamese officials believe the United States is continuing hostile policies against their country, that what we failed to win by war, we are trying to make up in other ways. They cite our refusal to grant diplomatic relations, our opposition to their policies in Cambodia (which, rightly or wrongly, they believe to be inhibiting Chinese efforts, through Pol Pot, at hegemony in Southeast Asia) and our creating a 60,000-strong backlog of dissatisfied Vietnamese promised entry to the U.S. but unable to be approved by both sides. Unspoken but doubtless believed, as well, is a U.S. hand in fomenting reported active resistance to the government in South Vietnam. And now the further tension over reported sightings, which are not taken seriously by any outside observers, of live Americans held against their will in North Vietnam. The Vietnamese are a proud and defiant people, and there are at least two sides to every story. Yet no visitor, however skeptical, can fail to be impressed by the vast gulf in national perspectives. To them, Ho Chi Minh was George Washington far more than a Communist, and no amount of insistence to the contrary could budge them from believing in the rectitude of their successful liberation struggle.  Why, we were asked, does the U.S. continue to oppose relations with Vietnam? Why, contrary to our postwar policies toward Germany and Japan, does the U.S. oppose assistance for Vietnam's development? Explanations relating to the continuing trauma of our wartime memories and current disagreement over Cambodia do not strike them as sufficiently persuasive. They say they would like to be more helpful on servicemen missing in action, but do not feel their helpfulness is being reciprocated.  Listening to the Vietnamese and then to our own policy makers in Washington, one has the impression of a dialogue of the deaf. Until this changes on both sides, both we and they will perpetuate the needless burden of our traumatic common past, rather than forge a new cooperative future.JOHN G.

"    ARE there still American prisoners of war in Vietnam? It is a ''haunting question,'' as ''20/20'' says, a question that declines to be dismissed. It lingers because families want to believe that husbands, fathers and sons are still alive; it lingers because of unresolved issues. ''20/20'' explores the question of prisoners on ABC at 10 o'clock tonight.  Say immediately that ''20/20'' doesn't really answer the question. How could it? Short of a house-by-house, camp-by-camp search in Vietnam - an entirely unlikely possibility - it is impossible to prove no prisoners remain. In the absence of an actual repatriation, meanwhile, it is almost equally impossible to prove that prisoners do remain. The families of those missing in action, the M.I.A.'s, are trapped in a cruel dilemma.  The entire program, produced by Janice Tomlin, is devoted to the issue. The first part of the program challenges the Army's method of identifying the bodies that have been returned to this country. In fact, the word ''bodies'' scarcely applies. Some of the families, on opening the flag-draped coffins, have found only a few shards of bones.  Tom Jarriel, the ''20/20'' reporter, interviews independent anthropologists who challenge the Army's identifications. They call them ''outrageous,'' and insist that the fragmentary evidence makes positive identification impossible. Mr. Jarriel also interviews an Army colonel who is placed in the extraordinarily difficult position of defending the identifications. One may sympathize with the colonel; he is facing an uphill task.  Subsequently, Mr. Jarriel reports on profiteering at the expense of the M.I.A. families. Organizations and individuals sell them hope. ''20/20'' visits the Thai-Laotian border. Information about the missing men is for sale, most of it, apparently, spurious. Moreover, as Mr. Jarriel says, ''Bone merchants offer to sell American remains to the highest bidder.'' It is a cruel, commercial enterprise.  Nonetheless, the search continues, and so do the reports of the alleged sightings of American prisoners. There have been more than 800 reports since 1975. ''20/20'' gives us one of the most intriguing reports.  Mr. Jarriel talks to Representative Bill Hendon, Republican of North Carolina, who gets weekly briefings from the Defense Intelligence Agency on the alleged sightings. Mr. Hendon took it on himself to speak to Robert Garwood, who emerged from Vietnam in 1979, saying he had been held as a prisoner of war. He was court-martialed in 1981 and found guilty of collaborating with the enemy.  Mr. Garwood told Mr. Hendon that American prisoners remained in Vietnam, and drew a map of a military compound in Hanoi where he allegedly saw them. The map was supposedly identical to one drawn by a Vietnamese refugee, who also said that Americans were held in the compound.  The Defense Intelligence Agency, according to Mr. Hendon, dismissed the reports and the alleged sightings. One reason it did, apparently, was that one of the reports said the American prisoners were seen bathing. The intelligence agency said this could not be true; the compound had no cistern.  ''If the cistern's there, that's the key to it,'' Mr. Hendon says, ''and the only way you're ever going to know if the cistern's there, is if you walk in there and see it.''  Accordingly, Mr. Hendon visited Hanoi last February. We see him leaving a meeting with some colleagues, walking to the compound and finding the cistern. What does this prove? It is still unclear, but the Defense Intelligence Agency, ''20/ 20'' says, is now re-evaluating Mr. Garwood's information. ''20/20'' is doing an intriguing, and appalling, program.

The Vietnamese suspended the talks after the American bombing raid on Libya on April 15, but negotiations resumed Wednesday.  The American official, Lieut. Col.

The Vietnam News Agency said Hanoi had provided preliminary information on 21 missing Americans in a meeting between American and Vietnamese representatives there last week.  The agency said the remains in 10 of the cases probably could be found, but no confirmation existed in the other 11 cases.  The unconfirmed cases could mean that oral reports, possibly from villagers, about missing Americans in certain areas proved unfounded after investigation.

"   , Thailand, July 14   A 79-year-old official with a reputation as an ideological hard-liner was chosen today to succeed Le Duan as Vietnam's Communist Party leader, the official Hanoi radio announced, The post is the most important political office in Vietnam.  The new Vietnamese leader, Truong Chinh, had been the second-ranking party Politburo member after Mr. Duan, who died last Thursday. Mr. Chinh is also the State Council Chairman, a position roughly equivalent to a ceremonial president.  In the 1950's, after North Vietnam gained independence from France, Mr. Chinh led an attempt at sweeping land redistribution that historians say may have resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Vietnamese. In the 1960's, Mr. Chinh was among those who advocated sending North Vietnamese forces to fight in the South.  In June, diplomats based in Hanoi said they understood that Mr. Chinh had already assumed some, if not all, of the powers of Mr. Duan, whose health was rapidly deteriorating.  Reported in Failing Health  Mr. Chinh, who is also reported to be in failing health, is expected to remain in office only until the end of the year, when it is expected that the sixth party congress will name a new generation of leaders, the first such sweeping change in Vietnam's post-colonial history.  Mr. Duan's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday in Hanoi. According to Vietnamese diplomats in Bangkok, only Laos, Cambodia and the Soviet Union will be represented at a high government level. Foreign journalists have been barred from covering the funeral.  The Vietnamese said Moscow's delegation to the funeral would be led by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzkhov, not the party leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Under Mr. Duan's leadership, the Vietnamese party maintained close relations with Moscow.  This evening, Vietnam's Southeast Asian neighbors heard the news of Mr. Chinh's promotion from Tass, the Soviet press agency, before it was announced by Hanoi. Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, was in Moscow over the weekend, and it was unclear if had returned to Hanoi.  Little Speculation by Diplomats  Asian and Western diplomats in Southeast Asia are being very cautious in predicting what kind of new leadership Vietnam may choose this year. Hanoi remains one of the most secretive capitals in which to work, ambassadors based there say.  Outside Vietnam, there has been a tendency to look for a loosening of ideology and a movement toward change, particularly in the Vietnamese economy, which is in shambles even by Vietnamese assessments.  In June, radio broadcasts from Hanoi were reporting that Le Duc Tho, who negotiated the peace agreements with Henry A. Kissinger that led to American withdrawal from Vietnam, was charging that some party officials were guilty of ''corruption, bribery, smuggling, enrichment, dissoluted and depraved living'' and ''adopting a vulgar lifestyle.''  Diplomats and scholars who have been observing Vietnam over many years suggest that Hanoi's statements, often reflecting pronouncements under Mr. Gorbachev's leadership in Moscow, seem to be calling for a ''renovation'' rather than a ''reform'' of the Marxist-Leninist economic system.  No Sign of Major Change  There has been little official indication in the Vietnamese party press that anything as sweeping as Chinese-style innovations will occur in Vietnam. Rather, the official publications, led by the Communist Party daily Nhan Dan, have harshly criticized the bureaucracy and the labor force for failing to make the present system function efficiently.  Since 1979, Vietnam has instituted a series of economic changes designed, the party journals say, to reinvigorate the economy by allowing a certain amount of individual initiative to dictate agricultural and some industrial production.  But the country's leadership has been ambilvalent about how much private enterprise to allow. This has led to radical swings back and forth, from tolerance to suppression, of small ventures like restuarants and shops, the proprietors say. Taxes have been alternately encouraging and punitive.  The result has been a cynicism, increasingly boldly voiced, among ordinary Vietnamese, coupled with a lack of confidence in the country's currency. For many transactions, the American dollar has become the standard of exchange.  Some Economic Officials Out  In June, at least eight officials involved in the managing of the economy were dismissed, including a Deputy Prime Minister, To Huu. Left in place were several people considered economic pragmatists, led by Vo Van Kiet, the country's economic planner.  But diplomats say that until a new party leadership is in place - later this year at the earliest - it would be premature to predict the direction Hanoi will take in future economic development.  The country is now almost entirely dependent on the Soviet bloc, whose aid has done little to improve the standard of living of the Vietnamese people. Eastern European and Western diplomats in Hanoi say it is an open secret that Vietnam wants better ties with the West, including the United States, because of the developmental expertise such ties might unlock.  But all such links are now blocked by the Vietnamese occupation of neighboring Cambodia and, in the case of the Reagan Administration, a failure on Hanoi's part to resolve to American satisfaction the cases of servicemen missing in action since the Vietnamese War.

"    A group of Vietnam veterans who marched from Washington arrived yesterday at Grant's Tomb for a vigil for 2,400 Americans still missing in Southeast Asia.  Fewer than three dozen veterans made the full march, and only about 100 people greeted them upon their arrival in Manhattan - far fewer than the 1,000 organizers had hoped to draw.  ''There's only a small amount of us who care, but we do care, and we care a lot,'' said Anthony Torres, march organizer for the New York-New Jersey POW-MIA committee. ''People saw us marching. Truck drivers saw us. This is about public awareness.''  Outside the monument, the marchers and their supporters gathered a half-block from a row of tents where many said they planned to stay in a 24-hour vigil.  They expressed a mixture of frustration and hope that prisoners of war and Americans missing in action would eventually be returned to the United States.  Vietnam, which has cooperated for more than a year in the return of remains of Americans missing in action, has repeatedly denied that it is holding prisoners.

"      The White House announced today that Vietnam had released a United States Army veteran who set sail from the Philippines 16 months ago in an attempt to bring out a Vietnamese woman.  The Vietnam War veteran, Robert Schwab 3d of Atlanta, arrived tonight in Bangkok, Thailand, where he will undergo medical tests, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said. It was unclear when Mr. Schwab, who is 44 years old, will return to the United States.  ''I'm overjoyed,'' Mr. Schwab's father, Robert Schwab Jr., said in Atlanta. The senior Mr. Schwab received a phone call from his son at 3 A.M. today ''Before that,'' he said, ''we thought he was dead.''  Mr. Schwab's stepfather, Robert Davis, who is vacationing in Blue Hill, Me., said the veteran was ''an intellect, an idealist, a sportsman, an adventurer and an author.'' He said Mr. Schwab was a 1963 graduate of Williams College who was ''deeply involved in Vietnam and Thailand'' through the 1970's and early 1980's.   Family Gets Diary  He sailed for Vietnam from the Philippines in April 1985, according to his father and aunt, Nann Pendergast, both of Atlanta. His purpose, they said, was to bring out a Vietnamese woman named Mai and complete research on a book about Vietnam.  Mrs. Pendergast said in an interview that the family knew nothing about the trip for more than two months, when they received a 60-page diary from a Philippine friend of the younger Mr. Schwab in July 1985.  ''He had told us he was going hiking in the Philippine jungle and wouldn't be near a phone for a while,'' Mrs. Pendergast said. ''But he left the diary with a friend and told him to send it to us if he wasn't back in two months.''  The diary described Mr. Schwab's meticulous preparation for a 1,000-mile journey in a sailboat across the China Sea. And it told of his fears.  ''The true hero would be a little scared and a lot excited,'' Mr. Schwab Jr. wrote in the diary, according to Mrs. Pendergast. ''I am the reverse.''  The diary also told of his desire to persuade the Vietnamese authorities to allow a Vietnamese woman he had met years before emigrate to the United States, Mrs. Pendergast said.  An Adventurer, Aunt Says  He had apparently met the woman while he was in the United States Army Signal Corps in Vietnam in the late 1960's, she said. ''We think he had stayed with her family while he was over there,'' she said. ''We have her picture. She's beautiful. She was not his girlfriend, in fact she was much younger than he was. But they had kept up a correspondence over the years.''  Mr. Schwab was a freelance writer and ''very much an adventurer,'' said his aunt. He was working on a book about Vietnam when he left, she said. ''He said he wanted to write the last chapter. Really I think he thought about all of this in terms of his getting material.''  There was no word today from White House officials on the fate of the Vietnamese woman. Mr. Speakes said details about her were ''a private matter.''  Search Efforts 'Useless'  United States officials had been notified by Mr. Schwab's family in June 1985 that he was missing, Mr. Speakes said. ''Normal search and rescue efforts were fruitless, as were inquiries to governments in the region by the Department of State,'' he said.  The White House announcement said that ''given the President's strong interest in all missing Americans,'' Richard Childress, director of Asian affairs for the National Security Council, was ordered to pursue the case with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi and New York. Mr. Childress did so for nearly a year, Mr. Speakes said.  Another White House spokesman, Dan Howard, said: ''Nobody else thought he was alive. The general assumption was that he was at the bottom of the South China Sea, and we kept following up and kept following up. Got the man back.''  Mr. Howard said Mr. Schwab ''came out alone'' from Ho Chi Minh City without the woman. He was accompanied by Mr. Childress. There were no details about where Mr. Schwab had been detained or how the Vietnamese had treated him.  According to Ann Mills Griffith, the executive director of the National League of M.I.A.-P.O.W. Families, Mr. Schwab worked for the organization in the late 1970's. She described him as ''intelligent'' and ''idealistic.''  Mr. Schwab served two tours of duty in Vietnam in the 1960's, she said, and remained in Vietnam from 1967 until 1975, when the Saigon Government collapsed. During this time as a civilian, he worked for several relief agencies, Mrs. Griffiths said.  According to Mrs. Pendergast, the family had no idea for more than a year if Mr. Schwab had even survived his boat trip.  ''His trip is the same trip that the boat people take, only going the other way,'' she said. ''It's very dangerous.''  Then came the 3 A.M. phone call from the American Embassy in Thailand, although the family had been told by United States officials about a month ago that he might be alive.  ''We just can hardly wait to see him,'' Mrs. Pendergast said.  VIETNAM REPORTS CONFESSION  BANGKOK, Thailand, Aug. 14 (Special to The New York Times) - According to the Vietnamese Government radio, Mr. Schwab confessed to violating Vietnam's criminal code and was released only after vowing never to repeat the crime. Until today, Vietnam had never publicly acknowledged that he was in custody.  A team of American military officers from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii is in Hanoi for technical talks with the Vietnamese on further searches for remains of missing Americans. It is not clear whether the release was timed to coincide with their visit.  Mr. Childress said at a news conference in Bangkok last month that Hanoi had promised encouraging news at the August technical session.  According to Alan Dawson, United Press International's bureau chief in Saigon in 1975, Mr. Schwab became a hero of the rushed evacuation that occurred as the city was falling to the North Vietnamese. ''He and some friends helped get out thousands of people when the Ambassador was still refusing permission to evacuate,'' U.P.I. quoted Mr. Dawson as saying. Mr. Schwab had a 17-foot plywood sailing dory built, which he stocked with jugs of water, a plastic sextant and three small radio transmitters, according to friends. They said they had last heard from him on April 18.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Robert Schwab 3d (AP)                      ",August 14 1986 ,11

"   , Thailand, Feb. 3   Pressure from grass-roots party organizations forced the sweeping changes in the Vietnamese Communist Party leadership in December, according to a Western diplomat based in Hanoi.  His impressions were supported by a group of American scholars who traveled extensively in Vietnam for two weeks last month. The Americans, taking part in a tour sponsored by the private United States-Indochina Reconciliation Project, heard frequent demands for economic reform and experienced firsthand the bitterness apparently felt by provincial people over Soviet influence in Hanoi.  Village children, shouting ''Russian! Russian!'' in Vietnamese, stoned the Americans on several occasions, according to a member of the group, Mary Byrne McDonnell, Indochina program associate of the Social Science Research Council, an organization based in New York.  The attacks stopped, Ms. McDonnell said, when group members identified themselves as Americans.  An Economic Crisis  Vietnam is facing a severe economic crisis, according to reports in its own Government-controlled press organizations. The Hanoi-based diplomat, who briefed reporters Monday on condition that he not be quoted by name, said projections by international organizations indicate that on an average day, about 60 Vietnamese die of starvation in a country where malnutrition is widespread.  Hanoi, which has been unable to produce or import birth control supplies, faces the prospect that the population, now 60 million, will rise to 100 million by the end of the century, the diplomat said. Without improved agricultural technology, he added, Vietnam will not be able to feed itself.  He said Soviet aid, now between $1 billion and $2 billion a year, mostly in large energy projects, is not addressing Vietnam's most urgent daily needs.  At the same time, Vietnam is expected to provide tropical produce to cold-weather areas of the Soviet Union. A Vietnamese-language broadcast from Moscow on Jan. 15, monitored and translated by the BBC, described the production of green vegetables for the Soviet Far East as ''central'' to Vietnam's agricultural research program.  'Classic Imperialism'  The diplomat characterized the Soviet Union's activities in Vietnam as ''classic imperialism of the kind that Lenin railed about.''  Several diplomats based in Hanoi have said the United States, and the West in general, should be finding ways to assist Vietnam at a time when Western expertise could offer an alternative to complete reliance on the Soviet Union.  The group of American scholars, led by John McAuliff, who is head of the Quaker-supported, Philadelphia-based Reconciliation Project organization, heard repeated requests for American assistance and training, Ms. McDonnell said. Officials cited bans on United States visas for Vietnamese scholars as a major worry. Virtually all Vietnamese technological training takes place in the Soviet bloc.  The United States, which does not have diplomatic relations with Hanoi, has said it will not improve ties until the issue of 2,426 Americans missing in Indochina since the 1970's is resolved. In addition, Washington insists that Vietnam withdraw its 140,000 troops from Cambodia, a demand made also by all other major would-be donor nations, including China.  Links Are Limited  Links between Washington and Hanoi are limited almost entirely to discussions on the missing Americans, and these talks have been sporadic and inconclusive.  The talks have slowed over the last year as Vietnam, according to diplomats, has been preoccupied with carrying out economic and political changes over the objections of ideological hard-liners in the party. The diplomats say the policy is conducted with an eye on China's example, but with care to use the language of Moscow. Most Western reporters have been denied access to the country since last spring.  The Hanoi-based Western diplomat who briefed reporters Monday, and other foreigners living in Vietnam who are familiar with the events leading up to the Vietnamese party congress in December, say a struggle within the leadership over how to respond to an outpouring of public criticism last fall was still going on two days before the congress opened Dec. 14.  Retirements at the Top  On the third day of the congress, it was suddenly announced that three top Communist leaders were retiring from the party Politburo. These were Pham Van Dong, who is also the country's Prime Minister; Truong Chinh, the party General Secretary and President of Vietnam, and Le Duc Tho, the powerful political figure who was Hanoi's negotiator in the Paris peace talks with the United States. Only Mr. Dong, who is 80 years old and very frail, had been expected to withdraw.  In addition, the country's Defense Minister, Gen. Van Tien Dong, and a former Deputy Prime Minister, To Huu, also lost their Politburo seats.  Nguyen Van Linh, a party official with long experience in southern Vietnam and a man thought to be a supporter of economic change and liberalization, was named to replace Mr. Chinh as party leader.  But in a National Assembly session that followed the party congress, the retiring Politburo members retained their Government positions, to the surprise of the Hanoi diplomatic corps. The retiring leaders are now expected to relinquish their Government titles at the next session of the Assembly, next June.  Some diplomats interpret the delay as an acknowledgment of continuing divisions in the party over the next generation of leadership. Other diplomats disagree, saying that this is no more than a graceful way to ease out a generation of heroes who could win wars but had trouble developing a country in peacetime.

"    To the Editor:  As do other writings on the events in and about Vietnam from late 1972 to the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, George McT. Kahin's review of ''The Palace File'' by Nguyen Tien Hung and Jerrold L. Schecter (Jan. 18) contains an implicit assumption that the 1975 North Vietnamese offensive was somehow a preordained event quite unrelated to the political situation in the United States. That is not so.  Hanoi's decision to undertake the 1975 offensive and its preliminaries at the end of 1974 was reached after much discussion. The key element was the regime's correct appraisal that the Watergate-induced political situation in Washington would all but insure that the United States in effect abandon South Vietnam. Although our intelligence on the decision-making process in Hanoi was fragmentary, it was clear to us at the Embassy in Saigon in mid-1974 (I was Deputy Chief of Mission there in 1974 and 1975) that the North Vietnamese leadership's assessment of the political situation in the United States figured decisively in their deliberations, and we so advised Washington in August 1974. That this judgment was correct has since been confirmed, notably by the North Vietnamese general, Van Tien Dung, in his book ''Our Great Spring Victory: An Account of the Liberation of South Vietnam.''  President Nixon began his second term in 1973 fresh from an election in which Vietnam policy was a -if not the - major issue. If the Presidency had not been emasculated by Watergate, Hanoi would not have gone for broke as it did in September 1974, and the scenario certainly would have been different.  It would be foolish to assert that, were it not for Watergate, there would today be a viable Republic of Vietnam. It is also wrong to claim, as Mr. Kahin does, that regardless of Watergate and the growing impotence of the Presidency from mid-1973 onward, the eventual outcome would have been the same because of alleged inadequacies of the Thieu Government; these always figured more prominently in the American psyche than they did on the ground, and were also vastly overstated by those in this country determined to advance their own agenda in regard to Vietnam.

"   , Thailand, Feb. 27   Hanoi has charged that Chinese soldiers killed and wounded dozens of Vietnamese civilians by ambushing them inside Vietnam or sniping at them as they worked along the tense frontier. The Hanoi radio, in a broadcast monitored here, said Vietnamese troops retaliated by killing a large number of Chinese soldiers.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 28 1987 ,11
"   , Thailand, March 26   In provincial towns all over Vietnam, the Communist Party has been criticizing, purging and punishing errant party workers, according to frank and unusually detailed reports in the Vietnamese press.  Preparing for National Assembly elections on April 19, local organizations have been reporting cases of corruption, abuse of power, embezzlement and expense cheating.  The press accounts, bold even by the standards of non-Communist Southeast Asian countries, confirm reports by Hanoi-based diplomats and visitors to Vietnam, who say the Vietnamese, among the region's poorest and most strictly regulated people, are demanding change at the grassroots.  Problems in the Military  At the same time, the Vietnamese Army newspaper has published accounts recently indicating that the armed forces, involved for the last eight years in a war in Cambodia, are facing serious problems in training, supply and morale.  Recent editorials in the army daily, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, criticized ''paternalistic'' officers who misinform and mistreat recruits. The editorials followed articles late last year calling attention to the poor living conditions of soldiers.  Writing about civilian corruption, the party newspaper, Nhan Dan, recently published a long report on abuses uncovered in Hai Hung Province, a relatively prosperous part of northern Vietnam between Hanoi and the port of Haiphong. Foreign reporters taken to Hai Hung early in 1986 saw thriving markets and private homes and threshing floors under construction. Food seemed abundant, and local leaders were proud of the region's creativity and energy.  Since last fall, however, local party organizations in Hai Hung have been busy investigating and exposing cases of ''negative phenomena,'' according to Nhan Dan. Several party leaders have been taken to court. Early this month, the newspaper reported these findings and official actions:  * ''A number of cadres were criticized for practicing corruption, enjoying special privileges, oppressing the masses, illegally occupying land and possessing houses beyond the prescribed criteria.''  * ''Those cadres and party members who were given special privileges or special rights to buy motorcycles, radios with cassette players and refrigerators at cheap prices have been asked to turn in these goods.''  * ''Truong Van Day, former director of the My Van district foreign trading corporation, made under-the-table deals with bad elements to embezzle large amounts of money and export goods.''  * ''Nguyen Van Tap, a cadre of Chi Linh district, forged documents to misappropriate money belonging to fallen combatants and war invalids. These cadres will soon be exposed before the law.''  * ''The provincial party committee has issued directives to sternly prohibit excessive carousing, gift-giving and granting of awards contrary to policy.''  Debauchery and Drugs  In another report, Quan Doi Nhan Dan, the army paper, described two criminal gangs that had been brought to justice. The first syndicate speculated in commodities, bribing officials with gold. ''Squandering state property, they bought fine houses and cars and engaged in debauchery,'' the newspaper said.  The members of the second gang were Hanoi truck drivers who made regular trips into Laos. ''While on cross-border missions, they brought with them gold, silver and large quantities of goods to Laos to trade for opium,'' the paper said, adding that on an undisclosed date this year, they were caught ''red-handed'' with nearly 340 pounds of narcotics.  Most Western journalists have been barred from Vietnam since last spring, when a long process of political reorganization and ''purification'' began. The changes may not be completed until June, when a new Prime Minister is expected to be named to replace Pham Van Dong, according to Vietnamese officials.  Hanoi's severe economic problems appear to have heightened the complaints and criticisms about the army as it struggles to convert itself from a revolutionary force into a conventional military organization, according to an Australian expert.  The expert, Carlyle A. Thayer, a senior lecturer in politics at the Australian Defense Force Academy and a specialist on Indochina, said the army is being forced to become a constituency - ''a bargaining group competing for a piece of the cake.'' Vietnam has one of the world's largest fighting forces, with 1.1 million regular troops backed by more than 3 million reservists and 1.5 million paramilitary personnel, according to Mr. Thayer.  In a telephone interview from his office in Campbell, Australia, Mr. Thayer said the priority on nonmilitary development had aroused fears among officers that the army might be shortchanged. He said complaints took on a ''poignant'' edge at garrison level.  Recruits Called Unprepared  Many of the recruits are rounded up in what was formerly South Vietnam and sent unprepared into Cambodian battle areas, according to Vietnamese deserters now in Thailand.  In an editorial read on Hanoi's domestic radio on March 11 and translated by the BBC monitoring service, the army newspaper confirmed that recruits ''have failed to adopt habits relevant to the requirements of building a modern, standardized army.''  Several days earlier, the Hanoi radio quoted from an editorial in the same newspaper that urged commanders to pay more attention to suggestions from the ranks.  ''We must keep the masses abreast of the situation,'' it said. ''What about the strengths and weaknesses of the of the unit, the strong points and the shortcomings of the leadership cadres and combatants? How tough are the ordeals to be encountered by the unit ahead?''  Army newspaper articles have also mentioned corruption. It is generally agreed by foreign experts that the dismissal of Gen. Van Tien Dung as Defense Minister in February was related to the business activities of his wife, who had reportedly built up a fortune from corruption and the black market.

"    ''THE HANOI HILTON,'' written and directed by Lionel Chetwynd, is an earnest but clumsy tribute to the heroism of the American servicemen - mostly officers - who were captured and held prisoner by North Vietnam during the long, desperate undeclared war we now refer to simply as Vietnam.  Mr. Chetwynd is aware that these men faced physical and psychological hardships unlike those faced by any other group of P.O.W.'s in the nation's history. The increasing unpopularity of the war at home obscured the prisoners' plight and confused the country's sense of loyalties. In many of the home-front debates over the war itself, the prisoners were, indeed, forgotten.  It's a big, tough, sorrowful subject, but Mr. Chetwynd finds no way to dramatize its singularity.  The movie, set mostly in a Hanoi prison, looks and sounds like something out of World War II, with American servicemen being cruelly abused by their small, sadistic, yellow captors. One new wrinkle: the presence in the prison of a Cuban interrogator - more vicious than even his North Vietnamese colleagues - who talks in the street jargon of Spanish Harlem in the 1980's, though the film is set in the 60's and early 70's. Without meaning to be, the movie comes across as racist, if only by default.                                       *  *  *  The drama itself, about how the individual prisoners react to their torture, depends so much on the pain of these scenes that it ultimately has the effect of exploiting the spectacle of torture. ''Aha,'' says the sadistic, Jesuit-schooled Vietnamese captor, ''it's time for you to experience Room 18!''  Unlike ''Platoon,'' in which the enemy remains vague and unseen, ''The Hanoi Hilton'' tries to characterize the Vietnamese, but only comes forth with secondhand stereotypes. It must be admitted, however, that the movie does no more justice to the characters of the prisoners than to those of the Vietnamese. Along the way, the movie also finds time to send up American peaceniks as represented by a bubble-headed actress wearing Jane Fonda's ''Klute'' haircut.  Though the film contains scarcely any action and though it's as sincere as a pledge of allegiance to the flag, its point of view is no less narrow than that of ''Rambo.''  Prominent in the cast, and doing as well as the simple-minded material allows, are Michael Moriarty and Paul Le Mat as captured American officers, Aki Aleong as the Vietnamese prison keeper and Gloria Carlin, who stands in for Miss Fonda.  ''The Hanoi Hilton'' opens today at the Coronet theater.

"   , Laos, Nov. 20   The United States and Laos announced today that Washington would begin considering the ''humanitarian problems'' of this isolated country as Laotians step up the search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  The agreement is similar to one concluded this past summer between the United States and Vietnam, under which American experts on the missing have already visited Hanoi for consultation.  At the same time, the United States is about to deliver a shipment of rice to Laos, where this year's crop, now being harvested, has been severely affected by drought.  The announcement today followed the first formal Laotian-American technical meeting on the search for missing Americans, held here Nov. 11-13.  It also follows a visit to Vientiane last week by David Lambertson, Deputy Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, and a trip to Washington in October by the Laotian Deputy Foreign Minister, Soubanh Srithirath. #555 Unaccounted For in Laos Fourteen years after the United States withdrew from Indochina, 555 Americans are still unaccounted for in Laos. Most of them were shot down in bombing raids on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, along which the North Vietnamese resupplied Communist armies in the South through Laotian territory.  The United States also bombed the Plain of Jars, where Lao Communist forces were numerous.  In addition to the missing in Laos, 1,757 Americans are unaccounted for in Vietnam and 91 in Cambodia.  Laotians say they are reluctant to make the search for missing Americans a national priority when so many of their own people were killed by American bombing from 1964 to 1973. Farmers in Laotian villages are still dying and being maimed by ordnance exploding in fields.  But pressures in the United States from organizations representing the families of the missing in action and unaccounted-for prisoners of war have forced the Communist Pathet Lao Government, which seized power in 1975, to deal with the issue as a prerequisite to better relations with Washington.  Private Searches Condemned  Both Laos and the Reagan Administration have condemned private American efforts to mount searches in Laos. American opposition to these illegal forays into this country was repeated today in a joint statement, which said such ''irresponsible'' acts were impeding government-to-government cooperation.  The United States maintains diplomatic relations with Laos at the charge d'affaires level. The small American mission in Vientiane, led by Harriet W. Isom, is the only American embassy in the three Indochinese Communist countries of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  But there is no United States aid program in Laos, one of the world's poorest nations. Until recently, aid been blocked by Congress, and no funds have been authorized in a tight foreign aid budget.  Today, a joint press release from the Government of Laos and the United States Embassy said the Laotians were considering excavating by themselves a crash site in Savannakhet Province. Two previous excavations were conducted in cooperation with American teams from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii.  Trying to Resolve 3 Cases  In today's statement, the Laotians also said they were trying to resolve three cases where there are discrepancies about missing Americans. The statement gave no details, and Lao officials declined to be interviewed.  In return, the United States said it would respond ''within the limits of its capabilities'' to the humanitarian concerns of Laos.  As an example, the statement said an American non-governmental organization was considering erecting a prefabricated clinic in the area where Laos will conduct its excavation of the site of an American plane crash. The clinic would be stocked with medicines at American expense.  The statement did not specify the organization involved. The Mennonite Central Committee and the American Friends Service Committee have development programs in Laos, but those organizations said tonight that they were not the agency planning the clinic.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   In April 1975, when the Republic of South Vietnam was on the edge of collapse, Nguyen Huu Co, a retired general and former Defense Minister, took stock of his options.  ''I thought first of leaving,'' he recalled. ''I had many American friends to help me. But the situation changed too fast.''  ''I failed to get out by plane because I had no priority,'' he went on. ''I went to Vung Tao and tried to leave by ship, but it was too risky. I had 11 children with me, and I couldn't accept the risk.''  Less than two months later, with Hanoi's army in control of this southern capital, Mr. Co was told to report for ''re-education.''  'Money and Clothes for Month'  ''They were very clever,'' he said. ''The announcement in the press and on television said that all people going to camp should bring enough money and clothes for one month.''  He was to remain in prison camps for more than 12 years. This September, at 62 years of age, he was released, the highest-ranking member of the former Government to be freed to date, officials say.  Diplomats and other foreigners in the country with contacts among Vietnamese officals believe that the release of Mr. Co and other generals shows some lessening in Hanoi's fears of former South Vietnamese military officers. Vietnamese acknowledge there was concern in the late 1970's that there would be a strong resistance in the South.  Some diplomats say that the highly publicized recent trial of guerrillas charged with trying to infiltrate the country through Laos under the leadership of a former South Vietnamese admiral might be a warning to those now being freed.  Describes His Experiences  Mr. Co, who met reporters at his home in the presence of a Government interpreter, although he speaks both English and French fluently, was relaxed as he described his experiences.  His account, if not complete, nevertheless provides information on conditions of important political prisoners serving long terms. It also documents the many shifts in prison procedures over the years that some diplomats in Hanoi think may have been at least in part related to political fluctuations.  In Mr. Co's experience, prisoners shifted from one ministry's control to another and moved from camp to camp more half a dozen times. Thousands of Vietnamese remain in these political prisons more than a decade after the Communist takeover.  An Exile in Hong Kong  Mr. Co, who was trained as a soldier by the French and Americans, was active in politics in the early 1960's, when he joined in overthrowing Ngo Dinh Diem, who, he said, ''made so many mistakes.'' Among these, he said, were promoting Roman Catholics from central Vietnam at the expense of southern Buddhists, and rewarding military men for loyalty, not merit.  By 1967, Mr. Co, then a Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister, had fallen out with Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky, whom he considered ''immature.'' He was sent into exile in Hong Kong for three years.  When President Nguyen Van Thieu allowed him to return in 1970, Mr. Co steered away from politics and became a commercial banker and later a businessman.  When he was arrested in June 1975, however, he was included in a group of 32 generals, and was treated as a military man in prison.  Sudden Move to the North  Mr. Co was first held at Quang Trung, about nine miles north of Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon was soon renamed. Conditions were good, he said. Prisoners could read and watch television. There were political lectures.  In June 1976, he was suddenly moved at night by air to Yen Bay, 120 miles north of Hanoi. Handcuffed, Mr. Co calculated his new position by counting the hours of flying time -four - and by noting that the sun was rising to his right.  In 1978, he and other generals were moved to Ha Tay, in the Red River delta east of Hanoi, to an Interior Ministry camp. Hard labor ceased. Instead, Mr. Co said, they were asked to write everything they knew about the South's military strategies and the functioning of its Government.  Education and Labor  In 1979, Mr. Co says he was moved alone twice - to Nam Ha and Thanh Lam - and experienced a period of combined political education and manual labor. Military and civilian political prisoners were mixed.  By 1981, he had been returned to Ha Tay and the other former generals. His last move, in 1983 was back to Nam Ha, until his release.  ''The last four years were not so hard,'' he said. ''I read books sent by my family. I wrote them letters, but they took a long time - sometimes three months - to reach them.''  A Christian, he also prayed ''inside myself,'' he said, and thought.  Wife Began to Work  ''What I thought about most was the condition of life, and how I could take care of my family.'' His wife, Nguyen Thi Tin, who had never worked, had begun to knit for factories. ''It was different, but I got used to it,'' she said. ''My spirits were high.''  Mr. Co said he also thought about Communism and democracy.  ''In both systems there are some things good and some things bad,'' he said. ''We have to teach each other to take advantage of the good points and eliminate the bad.''  Mr. Co, who attends a Baptist church three or four times a week now, is trying to make contact with friends and relatives abroad who could advance him money to start a business. His daughter Lau Nguyen Ward in Alhambra, Calif., has already provided some assistance.  Ultimately, the Co family will have to decide whether to apply to emigrate under the Orderly Departure Program. Mr. Co says he cannot think of going unless all his family, now including 15 grandchildren and a daughter of 21 suffering from Down's Syndrome, can come. He has lost too many years of family life to want to strike out on his own.  ''We pray to God to lead me,'' he said. ''If he wants me to go out, he will arrange everything for me and my family. If things are difficult, that means God blocks our way.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of Nguyen Huu Co and his wife, Nguyen Thi Tin (NYT/Fred R.

"   , Thailand, April 18   The people of Vietnam will vote Sunday in the first national elections to offer a genuine choice of candidates, according to official newspaper and television reports.  Voters will choose 496 deputies to the National Assembly, the third to be elected since the country was unified under Communist rule in 1975. They will also vote for local councils.  Under new election procedures similar to those being introduced in the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, each constituency must have more candidates on the ballot than the seats to be filled.  Vietnam is a single-party state - the Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan called it ''a tool of the socialist collective mastery system'' and a ''proletarian dictatorship'' - and all candidates are required to accept the Communist ideology.  ''The election must be carried out in a truly democratic manner,'' the newspaper said. ''Voters should not be driven into a situation where they merely have to cast their votes for a preselected name list.''  Correction of Abuses Ordered  Local party organizations have been bombarded with directives about conducting self-criticism, correcting political abuses, eliminating high-handed attitudes and listening to the sentiments of local people.  Exemplary provinces have been praised in the official press - at least one was reported to have introduced secret balloting in candidate selection - while those with poor performance have been castigated.  On March 23, according to a domestic radio broadcast monitored and translated by the BBC, a team of Hanoi assemblymen ''in a serious mood'' reviewed their performance and found flaws. The team ''was slow in solving complaints and denunciations from constituents'' and contributed little ''to the building of various social-economic projects in the capital,'' the radio said.  In the election Sunday, the Hanoi candidate list will be led by Nguyen Van Linh, who became General Secretary of the Communist Party in December.  Assembly Will Meet in June  Constituencies throughout the country have been directed to send into retirement members who are too old or ill to function effectively and to look for replacements who ''set good examples in their life style.''  The new assembly will not meet until June. Its first session is expected to coincide with the completion of changes at the top levels of the Government, according to Vietnamese officials and Hanoi-based diplomats.

"   , Thailand, May 1   As the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations prepare for new rounds of talks with Vietnam on missing Americans and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, the Japanese are being criticized in this region for steadily expanding Hanoi trade.  Asean has sought to isolate Vietnam economically so long as 140,000 Vietnamese troops remain in Cambodia.  Within the last week, Vietnam reported it had sold its first crude oil exports to two Japanese firms, Nissho Iwai and C. Itoh & Company. At almost the same time a consortium of 90 Japanese companies announced it was building a trade center in Hanoi.  Japanese businesses, sometimes acting with the help of the Japanese Communist Party, have been active in Hanoi for several years. Western diplomats in Hanoi say the businesses are positioning themselves to be Vietnam's dominant non-Communist trading partner when an unofficial but effective aid and trade embargo is lifted.  Asean leaders say Japan's trade links undercut efforts to use the promise of improved economic ties as a way of getting Vietnam to compromise on its eight-year Cambodia occupation. In a formal protest in late April, envoys of the six Asean countries - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines - asked the Japanese Government to dissuade Nissho Iwai from giving unofficial economic assistance to Vietnam until Hanoi's forces are withdrawn from Cambodia. Japan has provided no official economic aid to Hanoi since Vietnamese troops toppled the Communist Khmer Rouge regime in 1979 and installed another Communist Government that has been more cooperative.  Asean's protests over trade come as Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who speaks for the Association on the Cambodia question, is about to visit both Washington and Hanoi to try to reopen stalled discussions with the Vietnamese.  Also in May, Thailand's Foreign Minister, Siddhi Savetsila, will be going to Moscow to raise again the issue of Cambodia with his Soviet counterpart. The Soviet Union is Vietnam's main military and economic backer, and Asean wants Moscow's help in getting Vietnam to withdraw its troops.  These trips follow a recent announcement in Washington that the Reagan Administration is prepared to send the former chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff, Gen. John W. Vessey, Jr., to Hanoi as a special envoy to hasten the resolution of the cases of more than 2,000 missing Americans.  Hanoi-based diplomats say that Vietnam's recent actions may reflect political disagreement on how to deal with the United States.  There are no trade or diplomatic links between Washington and Hanoi, although economists say over $20 million in American goods reaches Vietnam through third countries each year.  Asean countries, led by Singapore, trade with Vietnam and Cambodia, although the amount of legal income is small. Smugglers supply the markets of Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and to a lesser extent Vietnamese cities, where goods from relatives abroad often dominate some shops.  Hanoi, facing severe economic problames, is now promising to make more of this private trade legal. Thai businesses have already expressed an interest in broadening commercial ties, arguing that their activities should not be linked to the Thai Government's demands that the 140,000 Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia first.  All regional nations, most oil producers, have been watching the development of Hanoi's oil industry with interest. There are assumed to be substantial reserves off the coast of southern Vietnam in Vung Tau, but the Vietnamese, working with the Soviet Union, are hampered in exploration and drilling by a lack of equipment.  Some economists believe significant quantities of oil are being lost or wasted. There are no pipelines, refineries or storage facilities in Vietnam.  His report said that four Japanese companies - Nippon Kokan, Nippon Steel, Kawasaki Steel and Sumimoto Metal Industries - are thought to be negotiating with Vietsovpetro, a state oil company, for pipeline construction contracts.

"      Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and President Truong Chinh, the last founders of the Vietnamese Communist Party still in power in Hanoi, were removed today by a vote of the National Assembly.  Their departure ends more than half a century of unbroken party and government leadership by colleagues and contemporaries of Ho Chi Minh.  The two men replaced today had resigned their party Politburo seats in December, when Mr. Chinh was apparently also forced out as General Secretary of the Communist Party. Mr. Dong had said publicly he wanted to retire.  Mr. Dong, who is 81 years old, was replaced as Prime Minister by Pham Hung, formerly Interior Minister, and Mr. Chinh, 80, was succeeded as President by Vo Chi Cong, a Deputy Prime Minister and former Agriculture Minister. Both newly elected officials are in their mid-70's, and both had played major political roles in North Vietnam's war against South Vietnam in the 1960's and early 70's.   New Party Chief in Charge  The choices were the least surprising of several possibilities that have been discussed in the region since the Sixth Party Congress in December, when Nguyen Van Linh was named the new party leader, putting him in the country's most important job. Mr. Hung and Mr. Cong have ranked as No. 2 and 3 in the Politburo hierarchy since then.  Foreign Ministers of the non-Communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations, meeting here today with their counterparts from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Community, said they foresaw no new policies in Hanoi as a result of the leadership changes.  Before the final steps in a yearlong political reorganization in Vietnam were announced today, Secretary of State George P. Shultz told the annual conference of the Asean nations -Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines -that it was ''imperative to keep pressure on the Vietnamese to end their occupation'' of Cambodia.  Mr. Linh, 71, the first party leader not to have been part of Ho's inner circle, is considered an economic pragmatist who was apparently influenced by the prosperity of the south while serving as Hanoi's top official there during the war against South Vietnamese and American forces.  The election of Mr. Hung as Prime Minister suggests that Mr. Linh could be meeting resistance from hardliners. Mr. Hung, a security expert who took command of the Central Office for South Vietnam in 1967, stayed on after Hanoi's conquest of Saigon in 1975, in a period when the policy of the unified nation was to crush the south.

"   , Thailand, July 8   Hanoi's official press has begun to lend credence to recent assertions by young boat people that alienation and protest among Vietnam's youth are on the rise.  Young Vietnamese are not likely to attempt public demonstrations, as their counterparts in South Korea or China have been doing recently. In the decade after the unification of the nation under Hanoi's rule, Vietnam has been one of Asia's most repressive countries. For many, the only avenue of protest is escape.  But recently there have been reports, for example, that a power plant was sabotaged by its young employees. Also there have been reports of a youth magazine's campaign to free a contributor who was arrested after he called living conditions for rural teachers ''deplorable.''  On Tuesday, the Vietnamese press agency reported that thousands of young criminals who had fallen under the influence of ''peer pressure'' or adult lawbreakers were being rehabilitated in schools for juvenile delinquents. The report said 8,000 youths had already been sent from these vocational schools to jobs in agriculture or construction industries.  Internal Criticism Urged  Under a pragmatic new Communist Party leader, Nguyen Van Linh, the Vietnamese are being urged to expose faults and shortcomings - an echo of the Soviet campaign for ''openness.''  Mr. Linh is assumed to be the author of a column titled ''Things to Be Done Immediately'' and signed ''N. V. L.'' that appears in the main Communist Party newspaper, Nhan Dan. The column advocates a vigorous restructuring of the economy, within the confines of Marxism-Leninism, and calls for full disclosure of failures.  There is resistance to this policy, Vietnam publications and radio broadcasts say, just as in the Soviet Union.  Nevertheless, frank airings of grievances and revelations of corruption have become daily fare. In the process, concerns about what official press organizations call ''juvenile delinquency'' or ''negative phenomenon among youth'' are beginning to appear more often - or be reported more fully.  According to exiles - many of them young people who say they are disillusioned with the country's bleak economic prospects despite more than a year of promises of reform - the young people engage mostly in passive resistance to directives. There is draft evasion and occasional sabotage.  Hanoi's domestic radio network reported in detail on one case of willful destruction on June 29.  Widespread Theft at Plant  The report, translated by the British Broadcasting Corporation's monitoring service, said that Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union at the Pha Lai power plant in Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, had looked at recent sabotage and made the following discovery:  ''Thefts of materials, equipment and coal; the removal of insulating tubes, and especially the stealing of accesories to starters on electrical equipment have occurred in the plant. More dangerously, thieves have replaced stolen electrical accessories with fake ones. Nearly all the 22 arrested persons are Youth Union members and workers in the plant.''  Young people fleeing Vietnam by boat say they fear forced farm labor in what are called new economic zones because of the harsh conditions. Young men also say they do not want to fight in Cambodia or on the Chinese border, both high-casualty areas where, they say, ''troublemakers'' are sent.  On June 28, Hanoi's radio service reported that ''assault youth security teams'' have been formed along Vietnam's northern border. The broadcast said that about 1,250 young people ''have volunteered to join in carrying out patrol duty, setting up ambushes and setting up special action cells.''  These cells, the radio said, are designed ''to popularize state policies and the law.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 9 1987 ,11
"      Secretary of State George P. Shultz confirmed today that Vietnam had relented and agreed to American conditions for a meeting with a special envoy to discuss the issue of missing servicemen.  But Mr. Shultz, speaking at the annual meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, also warned that there might not be much progress on the issue. He said it was good that Vietnam no longer insisted that discussions on missing servicemen be linked with the issue of normalizing relations.  ''We are pleased that the Vietnamese Government has accepted our proposal for a visit by a Presidential emissary on P.O.W. and M.I.A. and other humanitarian issues,'' he said. ''We are also pleased that Hanoi has confirmed that the two sides should not link these humanitarian issues with any outstanding political problem between our two countries.''  Earlier this month a Vietnamese official said Hanoi had sent American negotiators a letter dropping many previous conditions for talks.  Mr. Shultz warned, however, that Vietnam might still try to get economic aid in exchange for genuine discussion on the missing servicemen.  ''We intend to honor that agreement and expect Vietnam's leaders to do the same,'' he said of the understanding that normalization of relations will not be included in discussions. ''Nevertheless, in spite of these agreements, we must face the possibility that we will not be able to move the issue forward.''  Disturbed by Press Reports  He said he was disturbed by press reports that despite the agreement, Vietnam might try to raise the issue of reparations and economic aid under the heading of humanitarian cooperation.  ''Humanitarian reciprocity is one thing, but any attempt to trade information on our missing men for economic aid is another,'' he said. ''We cannot agree to this.''  An American negotiating team returned from Hanoi in May after failing to persuade Vietnam to accept the visit from the special presidential envoy, Gen. John A. Vessey Jr., retired, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  ''The Government of Vietnam has agreed to receive General Vessey to discuss the issue in Hanoi,'' Mr. Shultz said today. ''We are working out the final details with the Vietnamese now.''  No date has been set for the Vessey mission, officials said.  Foreign Minister Interviewed  His remark about press reports apparently refers to an interview with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, in The Washington Post this month from Hanoi. Mr. Thach said Vietnam intended to raise a wide variety of issues under the category of humanitarian matters, including property damage and personal injuries suffered during the Vietnam War.  ''If we can help the Americans on M.I.A.'s, then the Americans can help us heal our wounds of war,'' he said.  The United States has been seeking Vietnamese help in determining the fate of more than 2,500 American servicemen who were missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps.  American officials said Hanoi had been stalling on agreeing to the meeting in hopes that Washington would to allow the discussions to include the normalization of relations. The Vietnamese believe that normalization discussions would include the issue of reparations.  The Reagan Administration has been adamant that talks about the missing servicemen must precede any discussion of improving diplomatic relations.  Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested this week that the Administration proceed quickly with normalizing relations with Hanoi.

"      President Reagan announced today that his special envoy, Gen. John A. Vessey, would travel to Hanoi next month in an attempt to revive negotiations over missing American servicemen.  The announcement indicated that Vietnam had ended an attempt to link the high-level talks to economic assistance and political concerns, including the war in Cambodia.  A senior White House official said General Vessey, a retired officer and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would seek the resumption of technical talks on identifying the remains of missing American servicemen or prisoners of war. Vietnam broke off such talks in October, when American officials asserted that Hanoi was stalling to gain concessions on other issues.  ''Both sides have agreed that these discussions on humanitarian issues should not be linked to any outstanding normalization of relations or the Cambodian qustions,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.  The visit, which was arranged in recent weeks, will take place Aug. 1-3.  American estimates placed the number of United States servicemen who are missing from the Vietnam War or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps at 2,500. In September, the Pentagon said intelligence files and other evidence indicated that some American prisoners of war were still alive in Southeast Asia and that ''a large volume of evidence'' points to the likelihood that they are being held by the Vietnamese Government.

"      The ghosts of Vietnam haunt Senator John McCain and Colleen C. Shine. And they are not alone.  ''There is no way, absolutely no way, that we'll ever close the chapter on that unhappy part of America's history, the Vietnam War, unless we have a full accounting for those who are still listed as missing in action,'' said Senator McCain, a leader in Congress on the issue. The Arizona Republican, a former Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi in 1967, spent nearly six years in a prisoner-of-war camp and knew ''a couple of guys'' still listed as missing.  For Colleen C. Shine, the issue of the missing is more wrenching. ''My father, Lieut. Col. Anthony C. Shine, was shot down on the border between North Vietnam and Laos on Dec. 2, 1972,'' she said quietly. ''I was eight years old then. I have a memory of him. He's still unaccounted for.''  The Vessey Mission  From this vantage point, Senator McCain and numerous Congressional colleagues, as well as Ms. Shine, the public affairs coordinator for the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, gaze with wary hope at one of the highest-level efforts by the Reagan Administration to discuss the issue of missing American servicemen in Southeast Asia.  From Saturday through Monday, a mission headed by Gen. John A. Vessey, and including senior Defense and State Department officials, will be in Hanoi to discuss the United States servicemen who are still listed as missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps.  Few issues have stirred more frustration and - to families involved -despair, and few have had a more tenacious hold on politicians.  Legislators as ideologically apart as Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts have called for a ''full accounting'' from Vietnam of the fate of the so-called ''M.I.A.'s.'' On Tuesday, the Senate and House endorsed overwhelmingly, and without objection, proposals that supported General Vessey's visit to Vietnam.  ''The issue has taken on a sort of mythic character,'' said one key Senate aide.  Underneath the resolutions and ringing words, though, are only unanswered questions.  ''There's much fuzziness about what the words 'full accounting' really mean,'' the aide acknowledged. He and others said privately that no member of Congress would ever deny the possibility that, more than 12 years after the war, Americans are being held in Vietnam. But few actually believe it, the aide said.  ''What happened on this issue were two things,'' the Senate aide explained. ''When Reagan was elected he took a strong profile in '81 that the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue was not resolved - a view that he expressed even as Governor of California. And you had the spate of Rambo movies which perpetuated the idea that there are living Americans held against their will there. Of course, the Vietnamese didn't help with their attitude involving the return of American remains.''  The Vietnamese have denied knowing of any remaining American prisoners, and they have denounced as fabrications refugee reports of caches of American remains that have not been returned to families.  ''We do have solid reason to believe that the Vietnamese have been less than forthcoming in the return of the remains of those serivcemen who died,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House panel on Asian and Pacific Affairs. ''Why? I suppose they may feel there's a certain amount of mileage in doling them out. It's a ghoulish business, very cynical, but we have good reason to believe they could be more forthcoming.''  Diplomats believe the M.I.A. issue is sometimes involved in internal Vietnamese politics.  Thanh Bham, an attache at the Vietnamese Mission to the United Nations, said his country had tried many things in the last 14 years to resolve the problem, including returning all military and civilian personnel taken prisoner in the war, repatriating others who had remained in Vietnam and ''devoting great efforts for seeking information'' about Americans still missing.  ''I think that all these facts demonstrates the efforts and the sympathy of Vietnam towards the American people and American concerns on this issue,'' he said, ''although Vietnam has hundreds of thousands of its own soldiers missing in action.''  According to Ms. Shine's group, Vietnam has returned the remains of 170 identified servicemen since 1974. Most of them, 94, have been returned during the Reagan Presidency.  Like other legislators, Mr. Solarz is doubtful about the possibility of Americans still held captive in Southeast Asia, but he refuses to rule it out. He said ''a substantial number of live sightings'' by refugees, some of whom passed polygraph tests, had led him to conclude that it was ''not inconceivable'' that American prisoners remain in Vietnam.  Senator McCain was more categorical. ''We have to assume that there are Americans still alive in Southeast Asia,'' he said. ''I have no hard evidence of that and I base it on two factors. The first is the reports of unresolved live sightings. The second are what some highly experienced and highly respected peeople have said about this.''  He cited the comment last October by Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., a former director of Defense Intelligence, who concluded after a five-month review of intelligence files that there was ''a large volume of evidence,'' mainly ''live sightings'' by Vietnamese refugees, that pointed to the likelihood that Americans are still imprisoned in Vietnam.  It is widely believed in Washington that some Americans willingly stayed behind in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.  Complicating the issue, both politically and emotionally, is the position of the Vietnam veterans.  ''A lot of Vietnam veterans are fed up and don't want to hear about it,'' said Mike Leaveck, communications director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, which says it represents 30,000 former servicemen and women. ''There's a lot of craziness on this issue.''  He pointed out that after World War II, a total of 78,000 American servicemen were unaccounted for. After the Korean War, the figure was 8,000. The figure for Southeast Asia is now 2,413. ''The tragedy is that certain fringe groups have discredited this issue and have exploited the pain of many families,'' he said.  Senator McCain agrees: ''This entire issue has been exploited very badly by some people, including those trying to get funds for so-called Rambo efforts, people trying to inflame passions unnecessarily, charlatans, in some cases, who see this as a profit-making opportunity.''  On the other hand, Ms. Shine's group, known familiarly as the National League of M.I.A. and P.O.W. Families, maintains strong relations with Congress, the White House and the Vietnam veterans. Its executive director, Ann Mills Griffiths, whose brother is missing in Vietnam, routinely attends White House and State Department meetings on the issue and went along on General Vessey's mission to Hanoi this weekend.  Praise for Reagan  Ms. Shine said the organization has a membership of 3,500 families. She said that previous Administrations had responded with ''apathy and non-effort'' to the issue but that Mr. Reagan had brought it to the forefront. ''As Governor of California he wore a P.O.W.-M I.A. bracelet,'' she said. ''He has made this the highest national priority.''  Ms. Shine remarked that 20 years after the Vietnamese war against the French, non-French legionnaires who had been held prisoner were returned. What advantage would the Vietnamese have in keeping American prisoners, she asked.  ''I don't have the answers,'' she said. And then, after a moment, the young woman who last saw her father when she was 8, added: ''You have to believe in blind faith.''

"   , Vietnam, July 31   A special envoy of President Reagan and a new Vietnamese leadership are to open talks here Saturday on resolving the issue of Americans still missing in Vietnam 14 years after the withdrawal of United States forces.  Vietnamese officials are declining to comment publicly on what they hope to achieve in their talks with the special envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., the retired Army general and former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Hanoi put off receiving him until a sweeping leadership change was completed in June.  But Western European as well as East bloc diplomats in Hanoi say there has never been a more opportune moment for Hanoi and Washington to start anew on the process of building a relationship. The first step would be to make real progress on the issue of what happened to more than 2,400 missing Americans - 1,776 of them lost in Vietnam or off its shores, the others vanished in Laos or Cambodia.  A Special Shared Experience  The Vessey mission will also include Richard Childress, the National Security Council's director for Asian affairs; Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia; Gen. Robert Kingston, former director of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii; David F. Lambertson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, and several aides, according to the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry.  The sense of a special shared experience with America is very strong in Vietnam, foreigners in Hanoi say again and again. American visitors uniformly get a poignantly warm welcome.  A diplomat remarked this week that it was almost as if the war with the United States was the catharsis that allowed the Vietnamese to find their own self-image.  ''America is part of Vietnamese life,'' the diplomat said. The dollar is also the most important medium of exchange.  This diplomat and others say that the new leadership under Nguyen Van Linh, the Communist Party General Secretary chosen last December, must expand its links with the West if it is to head off even worse economic problems.  Mr. Linh's appointment was followed in June by the naming of a new Prime Minister, Pham Hung, who replaced Pham Van Dong. Vo Chi Cong became President at the same time, replacing Truong Chinh, the last party leader and head of state drawn from Ho Chi Minh's inner circle.  Vietnam is among the world's poorest nations. Its inflation rate is somewhere over 600 percent by most estimates. There is serious, widespread malnutrition and disease. In a risky political gamble, the new leaders are trying to tackle all these problems at the same time they begin a purge of corrupt party officials.  Vietnam receives large amounts of Soviet assistance, possibly $2 billion a year. This has sustained the army and provided a start on large-scale energy development, but has produced little or no visible improvement in day-to-day life.  Many Vietnamese, unhappy at their lot, have begun to display ''negative phenomena,'' the Government says. These include passive resistance to orders, draft-dodging and sabotage of an already weak economic structure.  Washington, leading an effective embargo, holds the key to Western aid, and the Reagan Administration has made the resolution of the missing Americans issue a condition for recognizing Hanoi.  Withdrawal of Vietnamese Troops  The United States, following the lead of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malasia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines - has also demanded the withdrawal of about 140,000 Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, more soldiers than Moscow has in Afghanistan.  Vietnamese officials and diplomats note in this context that Hanoi's leadership has just met this week for the first time in a year with the Asean spokesman on Cambodia, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja.  Diplomats and other foreigners in Hanoi and other Southeast Asian capitals say that over the last year, almost imperceptibly, the Cambodia war has become a bigger burden for the Vietnamese leadership, politically, economically and strategically.  The Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, who is now also a Deputy Prime Minister and will lead the Vietnamese delegation in talks with the Vessey mission, has been reviving his pleas for a greater American participation in un= tangling the problems of Indochina left behind by the war.  Hanoi is abuzz with rumors about whether or not the Americans and Vietnamese will agree to the opening of an American ''technical'' office in Hanoi - in a building the Vietnamese openly set aside for this purpose some years ago.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 1-   A long-sought meeting between President Reagan's special envoy on Americans missing in action in Vietnam and newly installed Vietnamese leaders began here today, but with scant hopes of real progress on either side.  ''I have no illusions,'' the Foreign Minister Deputy Prime Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told reporters this afternoon at the French-built palace that is the Government guest house. He was waiting to greet the envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey, Jr. General Vessey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was an officer in the Vietnam War.  Mr. Thach said there was no chance the United States would be permitted to open a technical office in Hanoi to speed up the process of searching for missing Americans unless Hanoi gets an office in Washington. The two countries have no diplomatic relations, or interest sections in each other's capitals.  'Two-Way Traffic'  Mr. Thach said an American request for such an office would mean that he would ''have to reciprocate.''  If such a request were made, he said: ''I will raise my desire to have an office in Washington. So you see it is a two-way traffic.''  General Vessey declined to answer when asked if he was authorized to make such a request.  At the same time, Vietnamese officials said today that they were intending to broaden the talks to include ''humanitarian issues'' of their own.  The opening session lasted barely an hour today, and recessed until Sunday morning, when the meeting may end, or be adjourned to Monday, if there is enough reason for further talks.  Diplomats here from both Western and Soviet-bloc nations are virtually unanimous in saying that Vietnam attaches a very high priority to gaining American recognition. They say they are watching the talks for signs of whether or not communication between Washington and Hanoi can be improved under the government of a new Vietnamese communist party general secretary, nguyen van linh.  Hanoi has sent conflicting signals to Washington in the last few years. Discussions on resolving the cases of more 2,400 Americans missing in action in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam, began to make substantial progress in 1985 under the American leadership of Richard Childress, the National Security Council's director for Asian affairs. In January 1986, when joint excavation of crash sites had almost become routine, Vietnam said it had ''Started the clock'' on a two-year deadline to resolve the issue once and for all.  But within a few months, while in the throes of preparing for leadership changes and scrambling to institute economic reforms, Vietnam suddenly turned negative toward the United States. By the fall of 1986, when remains were last returned to the United States, all but superficial communication had stopped.  Hanoi's Conclusion  Southeast Asian diplomats familiar with developments in Vietnam say that Hanoi had concluded it was getting nothing in return for its cooperation, despite its protests that this was a strictly humanitarian gesture.  President Reagan, under pressure from a lobby calling for action on the issue of the missing, appointed General Vessey his special envoy in January. It took until the end of may for Vietnam to agree to this visit.  General Vessey came to Hanoi today with Mr. Childress, Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, David Lambertson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific, Robert Kingston, former director of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, and Stephen Croker, an aide to General Vessey.  Diplomats here say the visit can be used by the Vietnamese as a demonstration of American interest, whether or not anything is achieved in the talks. Who comes to whose court is traditionally of great importance in many Asian societies.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 2 1987 ,11
"   , Vietnam, Aug. 2   United States and Vietnamese negotiators looking for ways to resolve the issue of 1,776 Americans still listed as missing in this country met briefly twice today.  Vietnamese officials were more optimistic after the talks this morning than they were on Saturday at the outset.  At a break between the sessions today, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told reporters the two sides had reached ''a better understanding'' on the issues.  Diplomats here say the talks will indicate how a new Vietnamese leadership under Nguyen Van Linh, the Communist Party general secretary, will be able to deal with Washington.  Mr. Thach, now also a Deputy Prime Minister, is thought to be one of the more influential members of the new administration.  The American delegation, led by John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to comment on any aspect of the talks, except to say there was more work to do.  This morning, when asked if a planned news conference would still be held on Monday, General Vessey, who is President Reagan's special envoy, brushed aside the question.  ''I don't know if you can expect one,'' he said brusquely. He also canceled plans for sightseeing in Hanoi today.  A previously unscheduled meeting of technical advisers was called for this afternoon. Technical meetings have in the past usually planned crash-site excavations or the returns of war dead.  There has been no decision about whether the higher-level talks will continue on Monday, when the American team is due to leave Hanoi.  ''The talk will resume when we are ready to resume,'' General Vessey said.  Remains of American war dead were last returned to the United States last fall. A resolution of the issue was interrupted, in part, by preparations for the change in Vietnam's leadership.  Many American officials, including most, if not all, on the team now in Hanoi, believe that Vietnam is holding several of the American war dead to be doled out as talks move toward what the Vietnamese hope will be eventual diplomatic recognition.  Few United States officials - and no Hanoi-based European diplomats -believe that any Americans are being held captive in Vietnam. But the Reagan Administration is under pressure from those who claim to have knowledge of such captives and say the Government is doing nothing to free them.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 3   An American special envoy left Hanoi today with no progress reported in three days of talks on Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  Without some forward movement on the issue, the Reagan Administration has said, there can be no hope of improving relations between the two nations. Washington continues to refuse diplomatic recognition to Hanoi 14 years after United States forces withdrew from Vietnam and 12 years after the fall of the south.  A five-paragraph statement issued at the end of the talks indicates that cooperation between Hanoi and Washington on accounting for the missing has not recovered even the momentum it had achieved two years ago, when the two sides had begun to meet regularly. Talks were interrupted last year while Vietnam went through a leadership change.  Today's closing statement, read by a Vietnamese interpreter, said only that two technical-level meetings would be held ''in the near future'' - one to discuss how to step up accounting for missing Americans and the other to address ''certain urgent humanitarian concerns of Vietnam.''  The leader of the American delegation, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, refused to answer questions from reporters.  Vietnamese officials also declined comment, leaving the impression that this was the wish of the American side. Repeated recesses called by the Americans this morning for private consultations indicated that there was trouble with even the wording of the final statement.  No Linkage of Issues  In what may have been a concession to the Americans, the joint statement said both sides agreed that humanitarian issues ''should not be linked to broader political questions such as normalization or to economic aid.'' There had been speculation among foreign embassies here that Hanoi was considering reviving demands for war reparations.  Two years ago, the United States won agreement from the Vietnamese to hold at least six meetings each year on the missing-in-action issue. In January 1986, Hanoi followed that with a promise to begin a two-year program to resolve the issue once and for all. The deadline is now five months away, and officials on both sides refuse to comment on what will happen when it passes.  More than 2,400 Americans are still missing in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam or off its shores. While most if not all are presumed to have died, there has been no final accounting of their cases.  More than a million Vietnamese are still thought to be unaccounted for. Among other problems left behind by the war are war widows, orphans, the children of Vietnamese mothers and American fathers and people said to be suffering from chemicals for defoliation of forests and and other purposes. There are also a large number of handicapped people, both civilian and military.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 4 1987 ,11
"   , Vietnam, Aug. 5   Vietnamese officials expect to open talks with the United States before the end of this month that will for the first time address Vietnamese problems arising from the war, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said today.  ''For the last 12 years, we have handled humanitarian issues for the United States,'' the official, Nguyen Dy Nien, a Deputy Foreign Minister, said in an interview in his office here referring to the accounting of the 1,776 Americans missing since the war.  ''I think now the United States must - has already made a start to - deal with the humanitarian issues of Vietnam,'' said Mr. Nien, an expert on United States affairs. ''We can not carry on one-sidedly.''  Officials close to talks last weekend between the Vietnamese and an American team led by President Reagan's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., say that the American side balked at agreeing to a future meeting on strictly Vietnamese concerns.  Action 'Is Important'  ''In negotiations sometimes there is only one word in the text and it can take hours to remove it and replace it with another word,'' Mr. Nien said when asked about the American attitude toward talks on Vietnam's human casualties. ''But I told the American side that the important thing is action.''  ''We would like to close this chapter as soon as possible,'' he added. He recalled that in January 1986, Vietnam set a two-year timetable to resolve the issue. He declined to comment on what might happen when that period ends.  The Foreign Ministry official said that Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries, had limited expectations about what assistance it could get from the United States. The Reagan Administration has ruled out reparations or war damages.  ''The humanitarian issues of Vietnam are enormous,'' Mr. Nien said. ''But we know the limits. We are realistic.''  Children of Servicemen  Mr. Nien said that in the recently concluded talks with the American delegation, the subject of the offspring of Americans based in Vietnam also came up. The Foreign Ministry official said it was his understanding that there might be a separate set of talks on this issue in the near future. Neither side knows how many of these children remain in Vietnam.  But a number of the children are reaching the age of majority, and Anerican humanitarian organizations say that this could make them eligible for military service, particularly since many are street urchins who might be viewed as delinquents.  Mr. Nien said Vietnam's political prison camp population, most suffering for their association with the United States-backed Saigon regime, had not been discussed with the Vessey party. He called this a political issue that was related to internal policies of Vietnam, Three years ago, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, had challenged the United States to empty the camps. Secretary of State George P. Shultz responded by offering to resettle the political prisoners in the United States.  Visit by Solarz  But when Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, visited Hanoi in December 1984 and asked if Mr. Shultz's offer would be accepted, he was told that the prisoners could not be released unless the United States could guarantee they would not take part in ''anti-Vietnamese'' activities abroad.  Mr. Solarz told Vietnamese officials that rights of free speech in the United States made such a promise impossible.  Mr. Nien said today that he expected that General Vessey would ''keep up contacts'' with Vietnam, although he is not expected to be part of the next round of talks, which will be at the ''technical expert'' level. The Deputy Foreign Minister said General Vessey, a veteran of the Vietnam War, had been cordial but frank in the recent discussions.  Asked if there was a chance that a further round of talks may be held in Washington, Mr. Nien laughed.  ''We are not so optimistic,'' he said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of Gen. John W.

"    The United States has refused to open diplomatic relations with Vietnam, but officials of the two countries have been talking for years about 1,700 Americans still listed as missing since the United States troops quit the war in 1973. Despite persistent reports that some of the Americans may be alive, no conclusive evidence has been found. Last week, a high-level American delegation went to Hanoi and agreed to add ''certain humanitarian concerns of Vietnam'' to the agenda.  But, in a terse statement, the Americans and Vietnamese said humanitarian issues ''should not be linked to broader political questions such as normalization [of relations] or economic aid.'' ''Technical experts'' will meet soon to discuss ways to speed up accounting for the missing Americans.  John W. Vessey, a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed a nine-member delegation of American officials and families of the missing. He declined to elaborate on the official statement. But Nguyen Dy Nien, a Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, said talks would begin this month. He added that there might be a separate discussion of the Vietnamese offspring of Americans. Neither side knows how many remain in Vietnam, but some are old enough to be eligible for Vietnamese military service, which could compromise their claims to American citizenship.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 6   At the 11th-century Temple of Literature in a quiet Hanoi park, there are three gates leading to the inner courtyard. The ornate one in the middle is for kings. Two modest ones flank it. One is for soldiers and the other for writers and scholars.  ''In ancient times, there were literary mandarins and military mandarins,'' Nguyen Du Chi, an art historian, said. ''But it was the literary mandarins who entered the court first, to advise the king.''  While writers, artists and dramatists interviewed this week about contemporary Vietnam avoided the use of what they call ''feudal'' terms, their message was the same. As the country struggles after decades of war to build a peacetime society, the literary mandarins are again advising the king.  ''We Vietnamese can live without breakfast before going to work,'' said Pham Thi Thanh, founder and director of the Youth Drama Group. ''But our hearts are dependent on the arts.''  Intellectual Ferment  Vietnam, and Hanoi most of all, is in intellectual ferment. Artists are turning to Expressionism, playwrights to self-indulgent, personal themes of relationships gone wrong. The youth group has gone on stage to pillory teachers who sell exam papers.  ''I have been a journalist for 35 years, and this is the most interesting period of all,'' said Huu Tho, an editor of Nhan Dan, the Communist Party daily newspaper. ''In wartime, we couldn't speak our minds.''  ''During wartime, we can say that leaders and writers had to unite ideologically in the cause of national defense,'' Ly Hai Chau, director of a literary publishing house, said.  ''But in peace, the writer can return to a reflection of ordinary life - offering new ideas and being in the forefront of public opinion.''  Little Is Sacred  The change has come in the last year or two, in the company of economic liberalization and a self-criticism campaign before which little is sacred, not even the Communist Party's leadership over the last half-century.  There are limits to expression in Hanoi - except in a small, clandestine publishing world that an outsider cannot measure. And there is a fear among some that the door to expression can be closed as easily as it was opened.  There can be no movement to challenge the Communist principles of the country's founders. Nor would anyone start a campaign against the nine-year-old war in Cambodia that drains already slender resources and asks a new generation of men to risk their lives.  But in a recent book, ''Time Gone Away,'' Le Luu tells the story of an ordinary man defeated by life who describes in flashbacks the failures of his society and his own passivity in the face of those failures. The success of the book is described as sensational.  Change From Within  Vu Tu Nam, director of the Vietnam Writers' Association publishing house, said the book, which appeared last year, could not have been published three or four years ago. At the literary publishing house, Mr. Chau said he was reviewing manuscripts that had been rejected in previous years.  Vietnamese who are sensitive to suggestions they are under Soviet influence say the wave of introspective criticism is not a development that has been forced on the country by Moscow, Hanoi's patron.  Rather, they say, it is something that comes from within Vietnam itself, just as economic changes in the city grew out of five years of experience with ''contract'' private-enterprise farming, or from a reluctant admission that some of the methods that had been used by the south could be applied without damaging the Communist orthodoxy of the north.  In Hanoi, private businesses, which are beginning to expand under liberalized city laws, are drawing families back together into ancestral homes and neighborhoods from scattered cooperatives.  New Currents  Old habits return, even in rough economic times. This year, for example, Hanoi got a gardening club.  The new currents, thus, move in two directions: inward toward a revival of ancient Vietnamese cultural traditions - not only in the arts - and outward for broader links with the world.  Vietnam's poverty, intellectuals say, is creating a stagnating isolationism. A European ambassador here said this disturbs many Vietnamese who remember that this was once one of the most cosmopolitan societies in Asia.  While shelves in Hanoi bookstores groan under the weight of unsold heavy Soviet technical volumes, readers, translators and publishers press on a visitor lists of books by American authors they would like to have - Kurt Vonnegut, William Styron, Eric Segal - or they simply ask for ''anything new.'' They want to go beyond Mark Twain, Jack London and John Reed. Alex Haley's ''Roots'' was a recent success.  Novels in Limited Supply  Contemporary Vietnamese novels and short-story collections are printed in limited quantities because of a shortage of paper, and they sell out almost before they reach the stores. Mr. Chau remarked that Vietnam must be unique in the world in having a black market in its own literature.  At night, the Vietnamese flock to theaters through repeated power failures to see exquisitely costumed actors recreate old plays in auditoriums that are little better than stifling barns.  ''We can be nationalistic, modern, realistic and romantic,'' said Mrs. Thanh, who studied theater in the Soviet Union, as she guided a visitor around the Youth Drama Group's rehearsal rooms. Her aims, she said, were ''to praise love and life'' and to link a new generation of wartime children with their rich, but forgotten past.  ''The best things of Vietnam have been abandoned everywhere - not only in the theater,'' she said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 9 1987 ,11
"      A Presidential envoy who visited Hanoi last week said today that Vietnam insisted it did not have control over any living Americans missing in action from the war.  Nevertheless, the envoy said, Hanoi suggested the possibility that there might be some in Southeast Asia, and the United States and Vietnam agreed that Hanoi would step up its effort to find missing Americans or their remains.  The envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he would not speculate on whether there are Americans being held involuntarily in Vietnam.  ''There are certainly all sorts of evidence to show that some might be there, but yet it has been a long time since the end of the war,'' General Vessey said.  He said that while the Vietnamese insisted that ''there are no live American prisoners under the control of the Vietnamese Government,'' they ''acknowledged that there are some wild parts of their country.''  ''The suggestion is that it is possible for there to be live Americans in Southeast Asia, not under the control of the Vietnamese Government,'' he said. ''That is the inference that I draw. They did not say that.'' Three Days of Talks He talked with reporters at the White House after briefing President Reagan on his three days of talks in Hanoi with Vietnamese officials on the issue of Americans missing in Vietnam. He was appointed President Reagan's special envoy on the matter last January.  He said the United States and Vietnam agreed that Hanoi would speed its efforts to find missing Americans or their remains, and that Washington would send experts to Hanoi to look into ''humanitarian concerns that the Vietnamese have,'' such as war orphans and people incapacitated by the fighting.  ''We agreed that we would address these as humanitarian concerns and not link them to broader political issues, such as normalization of diplomatic relations, resumption of trade or economic aid,'' he said.  More meetings will be held in Hanoi at the end of the month on the issue of the missing and the humanitarian issues, he said.  There are 2,413 Americans missing in action in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam.  General Vessey said Vietnam had agreed to pursue 220 cases involving missing Americans, including 70 cases on which the United States has compelling evidence that an American was alive after being reported missing.  ''We have people who were seen parachuting close to their forces, most probably captured,'' he said. ''Those men did not return, nor have their remains been returned.'' In another case, a picture of a wounded American was published during the war in a Vietnamese newspaper, yet he did not return and his remains have not been recovered.

"   , Vietnam   On the narrow, green coastal plain that winds north from Da Nang to the 17th parallel, once the dividing line between two Vietnams, war stories are told not by soldiers alone.  Some of the fiercest fighting of the ''American war'' took place here, and every adult is, to one degree or another, a veteran: the 50-year-old Buddhist monk in his vegetarian kitchen; the poet, an aristocratic woman of 78, tending her orchards; the young man, barely 30, who sailed away in a rickety boat 10 years ago and has come back to embrace the parents who suffered because of his choice, and the former soldier from Hanoi, still heartbroken by the loss of his first love, who married another while he was at war.  In early 1968, at the time of Tet, the lunar new year, Hue and Da Nang were at the center of a fierce offensive, a campaign that is now regarded as an attempt by Hanoi to conquer the northernmost southern cities.  The former North Vietnamese soldier, now living here, and others say troops had been sent into the area in 1967 to prepare for the campaign. Hue seemed ready to fall; it had been a center of Buddhist and student protest against the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem, who was assassinated after a coup in 1963.  American and South Vietnamese troops dislodged the Communist forces in more than a month of heavy fighting, and Hue and Da Nang remained in Saigon's hands until the war ended in 1975.  Residents of Hue are unexpectedly neutral when speaking with an American about the events of 1968. Outside and occasionally inside Government offices, the battles are called simply ''the war,'' not the standard ''American war of aggression.''  One Government official in a coastal town south of here said people understood that many Americans had come here to fight for something they believed in. Sometimes, the Vietnamese seemed to be blaming Americans less for what happened here than Americans blame themselves.  While a provincial official in Hue, recounting the city's architectural history, told a visitor that ''nothing was added in the 30 years of the puppet regime,'' townspeople pointed to the American-built roads, the bridge linking two halves of the city across the Perfume River, the Hue Central Hospital, and the Huong Giang Hotel, once American officers' quarters and now the focus of the city's plan to build a tourist industry.  People in Hue also say they are aware that American forces made a difficult decision to spare the temples and palaces inside the walls of the 19th-century Citadel, Hue's landmark. They acknowledge that the complex was used by Hanoi's army and the Vietcong to shelter troops and store ammunition.  War Continues to Kill  The Tet campaign continues to exact a deadly toll, said Nguyen Dinh Ngo, the lieutenant governor of Binh Tri Thien Province, of which Hue is the capital.  ''Even this very minute, while we are sitting here talking, somewhere in the province someone is getting killed by the war,'' he said.  Mr. Ngo said 4,000 to 5,000 people have died in peacetime defusing or stumbling on unexploded ordnance. Thousands of bombs and mines have yet to be discovered, he added.  Mr. Ngo said another 230,000 have been affected by toxic chemicals.  Mr. Ngo did not identify the chemicals, and this was not an area sprayed by American defoliants. A few American scientists - especially Dr. Arnold Schecter of the State University of New York at Binghamton - are trying to help the Vietnamese clarify and analyze the type and extent of chemical exposure they may have suffered, a corollary to work being done in the United States on Agent Orange.  Emotional Damage Continues  The young man returning from a new life in the West - under Hanoi's recently relaxed attitude toward ''boat people'' who want to visit home and family - said the war had an effect on more than bodies and buildings. It had altered the psychology of the people he remembered, he said.  This young man said that on this trip, for the first time in his life, he quarreled with his mother. He had chided her for behaving uncharitably to members of the family, he said.  ''She said to me - and she was angry - 'You have no idea what life has been like here, and you can't tell me what to do,' '' he recalled.  In the garden of a spacious riverside family compound, Nguyen Dinh Chi took a different view. Tong Chi, the pen-name by which she is known, said that little has changed in Hue except that the Vietnamese people are finally free.  Mrs. Chi was the wife of a mandarin in Hue in the court of the last kings of Vietnam. She was among those who made the decision after 1968 to join the rebellion against Saigon and the Americans. After the end of the war, she came back to her family home and began to turn its orchards into a sustaining business.  This year, she spent six months in France, visiting relatives. She hopes to visit Boston, where a sister lives, but that will have to wait until diplomatic relations are established between Hanoi and Washington, she said.  At the 17th-century Bao Quoc pagoda and monastery, the abbot, the Venerable Duc Thanh, recalled the American era kaleidoscopically.  Two-thirds of his monastery was destroyed by American bombing, he said. He avoided the question of why this happened. At another pagoda, someone said matter-of-factly: ''The VC were there, and who could tell the VC to leave?''  Hundreds, possibly thousands, of people were reported killed by Communist forces during the Tet offensive because they refused to cooperate, or had been singled out earlier as potential obstructions. Officials here deny the charge, or refuse to discuss it, as do ordinary Vietnamese, who say only: ''The people know what happened.''  'They Were Good People'  Many of Hue's Buddhist temples became part of the war, by choice or circumstance. It was from the Thien Mu Pagoda that the monk Thich Quang Duc went south to set fire to himself on a Saigon street - a widely publicized act that brought world attention to Vietnam in 1963. Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war.  The car in which the monk was driven is now up on blocks at the pagoda, on permanent display, complete with a picture of the immolation.  On the other hand, the Venerable Duc Thanh, whose monastery is famous for its vegetarian kitchen, orchids and bonsai trees, recalled how young American soldiers came to his temple to learn Zen Buddhism. ''They were good people,'' he said. ''I have heard there are many Zen temples in America now, and I would like to visit them one day.''

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   Vietnam, falling further and further behind its free-market Southeast Asian neighbors in development, is about to begin an ambitious two-track investment campaign.  Officials appear willing to deal with just about anyone with capital but are placing special hopes on tapping the accumulated wealth of the hundreds of thousands of ''boat people'' and other exiles who now live in the West.  Vietnamese emigrants, being wooed with nostalgia, already play a large role in the newly liberalized ''family economy,'' supplying relatives with goods to sell in local markets and mom-and-pop businesses. They also send machines, tools and parts for small industries. Such shipments, along with dollars, are now allowed to enter Vietnam almost without limit. Emigrants are also allowed to return for visits.  Western nations restrict trade with Vietnam and give it no official aid, in protest of the presence of 140,000 Vietnamese troops in neighboring Cambodia, which Vietnam invaded in 1978. Vietnam and the United States have no diplomatic relations.  The Bureaucratic Maze  At the heart of the development campaign is a new investment code, which Hanoi says will be ready by the end of this year after having been tied up since 1984 in what now appear to have been political disagreements. The new law is intended to remove many bureaucratic barriers that have made doing business here virtually impossible for most Westerners.  The new investment climate, the Vietnamese say, will also be enhanced by recently enacted statutes that greatly liberalize both individual and official Vietnamese dealings with the non-Communist world.  Until a change in Government leadership over the last year began to place economic pragmatists in the Communist Party leadership, Hanoi had one of the most isolated and orthodox systems of any Communist country.  Ideologues from the relatively backward North, it is now conceded, destroyed the economy of Vietnam, making it one of the world's poorest nations. Reliable statistics are virtually nonexistent, but the nation's per capita income is thought to be under $175 a year and the inflation rate is believed to be 600 to 700 percent.  'Many, Many Complaints'  ''We have had many, many complaints about our bureaucracy, and we know we must improve,'' Luu Van Dat, director general of the Research Institute for Foreign Trade and the coordinator of the new code, said in a meeting with reporters in Hanoi.  ''The code will simplify investment,'' he said. ''The foreign investor will deal only with one oversight committee headed by a high Government official. He will not have to go to many offices.''  Mr. Dat is confident that Vietnam will find foreigners who are interested in ''our abundant products of land and sea,'' especially tropical fruits and shellfish. Asked who would back him this time if politics intrudes, he pointed to the ceiling and said, ''Now I can go right to the top.''  The top includes a new party general secretary, Nguyen Van Linh. A northerner, he appears to have been much influenced by a long career in the South, first as Hanoi's overseer of the Viet Cong during the war with the United States and later as party leader after the fall of Saigon, since renamed Ho Chi Minh City.  Clash With Hard-Liners  Mr. Linh's sympathies for southern-style economics and its active private sector may have nearly removed him from power in the early 1980's, when hard-liners had the upper hand in Hanoi.  At least as important to sustaining change are Vo Van Kiet, the director of state planning, and Vo Chi Cong, the new chairman of the Council of Ministers, or President. Vietnamese say Mr. Cong, when he was agriculture minister, quietly tolerated free-enterprise farming on a wide scale.  Mr. Dat, outlining the new code, said Vietnam would welcome both private investors interested in joint ventures and investment by the subsidiaries of foreign companies. He also said it would allow contracts for resource development - oil is a priority in this energy-poor country -and for the building of a tourism industry. Tourism is one area where the expertise of ''overseas Vietnamese'' with experience in restaurant management and hotel and other service industries is being actively sought.  Goal of Industrialization  Much of the hope for industrialization with foreign help is centered on Ho Chi Minh City. As Saigon, the city had a relatively high standard of development and entrepreneurial talent before it fell to Hanoi in 1975.  The city has its own Import-Export Corporation and a consular office that allows it to bypass Hanoi in some cases. For foreigners, Imexco is often the best place to make exploratory contacts with the Vietnamese.  Imexco's new director is Nguyen Van Hoang, who until a few months ago was Vietnam's trade representative in Singapore, where much unofficial business is done. He said in an interview that the South was the acknowledged finance center of Vietnam, with a good deal of technical equipment remaining from the days before the North took over.  Mr. Hoang said that during the last year and a half, local governments had opened the way to expansion by light industry.  The city planners are focusing on handicraft export - artisanship is of high quality in Vietnam, but the country's isolation has allowed marketing to deteriorate - and the manufacture of consumer goods for the home market as well as for barter with other socialist economies.  Other Factories Opening  Garment and shoe factories and some electronic assembly lines are also being introduced.  Although Vietnam's new investment law is said to include tax incentives and the promise that profits can be repatriated, some potentially troublesome areas remain. These include the granting of resident permits for business executives and setting the number of foreigners allowed to supervise operations here.  An Eastern European who has worked on joint ventures said many bitter lessons were learned from turning over too much of an operation to local managers. Skills are low, and corruption and theft have been rampant. The Government is conducting a campaign against theft, but temptations are great in a land so poor.  A drive by the Japanese for a head start under the new investment law is leading to ethical problems, Vietnamese say. Would-be Vietnamese partners are learning to seek Japanese ''gifts'' - from exotic calendars to motor scooters and, occasionally, cars or trips to Tokyo.  New Attitude Spreading  A Western European business executive said that mentality had become widespread in the last year or two. As an example, he mentioned the drivers assigned to foreigners. Occasionally the drivers demand Western cigarettes and, if denied them, slow down or refuse to provide services already paid for.  Vietnam's intrinsic problems are monumental: Most manufacturing is done in primitive conditions in deteriorating plants. Hygenic standards are low. Workers at a frozen-food factory were seen sorting cuttlefish on a concrete surface that also serves as a driveway for trucks. Throughout the country, water is unsafe to drink.  Roads in Vietnam are few - the best were built by the Americans -and in bad repair.  Fuel and utility supplies are, at best, unreliable. A journalist's scheduled visit to some of the small private factories here, on which so much hope is being placed, was canceled because electricity in the entire neighborhood had been off for two days.

"      Administration officials say the United States will officially encourage charitable assistance for Vietnam in exchange for increased cooperation from Hanoi in resolving cases of Americans missing in action during the Vietnam War.  Although the agreement, worked out with the Vietnamese last month, falls short of Hanoi's request for economic aid or war reparations, it is the first time that Washington has agreed to provide Vietnam with anything in return for help on this sensitive issue. It also marks an expansion of United States relations with Vietnam.  Without publicity, two doctors specializing in artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices and the head of an international charitable organization held talks last week in Hanoi where they had gone as an official United States delegation.  Report on Humanitarian Needs  Based on its findings, the Administration intends to issue a report detailing the humanitarian needs of the Vietnamese. It will focus on the thousands who require prosthetic devices as a result of the war as well as those since crippled by disease.  As a result, the Administration expects the Vietnamese to cooperate more fully on solving the issue of military personnel still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War. Officials said they are especially hopeful that Vietnam would be able to provide information to help clear up about 70 ''very compelling'' cases.  ''This means we crossed a line we never crossed before,'' said a senior official familiar with the dealings with the Vietnamese.  Resulted From Vessey Visit  United States officials had steadfastly refused to discuss economic assistance or war reparations as part of the talks about the missing servicemen. As a compromise, Washington will facilitate aid from private groups, which are now prohibited by a long-standing trade embargo.  The agreement was the result of a visit last month with senior Vietnamese officials by John W. Vessey Jr., a retired general, who led a special delegation to Hanoi to discuss the missing. The Administration will issue regulations providing exemptions to trade restrictions that will allow licensing of private organizations to provide charitable relief.  ''When the United States Government gives its blessing to this, we're saying that they're no longer a pariah,'' said the official.  'An Area of Accommodation'  Administration officials also depicted the agreement as an important step in successful negotiations with Vietnam. ''This provides an area of accommodation, of reconciliation,'' said one official. ''If they're smart, they won't try to leverage it into any kind of official recognition. If they try to use it as an opportunity and not a weapon, it can be promising.''  The United States has been seeking Vietnamese help in determining the fate of more than 2,400 servicemen who were listed as missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps. American officials earlier expressed exasperation in negotiating with Hanoi, accusing the Vietnamese of stalling, in hopes that the discussions would include the normalization of relations and economic aid.  Shultz Aired Pessimism  Before Mr. Vessey left for Vietnam, Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed pessimism that a breakthrough could be achieved. ''Humanitarian reciprocity is one thing,'' he told a veterans' group in July. ''But any attempt to trade information on our missing men for economic aid is another and we cannot agree to this.''  The category of artificial limbs was chosen as ''a particularly suitable first step,'' according to someone familiar with the negotiations. Artificial limbs and prosthetic devices are ''something tangible, something the Vietnamese can look at.'' He added, ''It's also especially appropriate after a war characterized by landmines and grenades in which many people were disfigured.''  According to some estimates, there are 60,000 amputees in Vietnam as a result of the war. There are also thousands of young people paralyzed from polio, according to one official.  The Administration hopes to have Vietnamese cooperation on what are known as ''discrepancy cases.'' Officials described those cases as those in which a serviceman did not return home after having been sighted alive after being taken prisoner, such as by fellow prisoners-of-war in a camp or in photographs of prisoners.  Dropped Its Insistence  American officials also say that Vietnam has dropped its insistence that they would no longer discuss the issue beyond next January. In January 1986, the Vietnamese said they would begin a two-year program to deal with the issue of American servicemen missing in action once and for all.  Hanoi says that more than one million Vietnamese are unaccounted for from the the war and that among the problems remaining are war widows, orphans, defoliated forests, destroyed villages and children of American servicemen.  The team that returned this week included Frederick Downs, the chief of the prosthetics service of the Veterans Administration; Dr. Carlton G. Savory, a Georgia orthopedist, and Larry E. Ward, who has had long experience in international relief organizations.  According to the National League of Families of American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, Vietnam has returned the remains of 170 identified servicemen since 1974, of which 94 have been returned during the Reagan presidency.  Many American officials are deeply resentful at what they believe is Vietnam's intention to dole out the remains of other servicemen as talks progress.  A more intriguing, but murkier issue, is whether any American servicemen remain alive in Vietnam. Vietnam has asserted that it has no other prisoners and has no knowledge of any remaining live Americans in the country. Few United States officials officials believe that any Americans are still being held prisoner. But it is possible, officials say, that some Americans voluntarily remained behind.

"      A spokesman said today that the State Department was not linking progress on the issue of missing servicemen in Vietnam to private charitable aid to that country.  Charles E. Redman, the Department spokesman, said a decision to encourage private organizations to provide aid, especially prosthetic devices for amputees, was not connected to American efforts to obtain information about American servicemen missing since the Vietnam war.  ''We believe that P.O.W.'s-M.I.A.'s is a separate issue which stands on its own merits,'' Mr. Redman said, using the initials for American prisoners of war and those missing in action.  The Administration, according to high-level officials, plans to facilitate private charitable aid to Vietnam. The officials also said they hoped Vietnam would be more cooperative in solving the issue of missing personnel, especially about a group of ''very compelling cases'' said to number about 70.  Accords Reached Last Month  The agreements on both issues were worked out last month with senior Vietnamese officials by Gen. John W. Vessey Jr. a retired general who led a special delegation to Hanoi. After his visit, two official teams traveled to Vietnam, one a medical team to study the humanitarian needs of the country and the other to work on the 70 major cases.  Under the plan for facilitating non-governmental aid, the Administration intends to issue a report detailing the needs and encouraging private groups to provide it. The Administration will also provide exemptions from trade restrictions to license such groups to provide the aid.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 9 1987 ,11
"      The United States and Vietnam have reached agreement in principle on a program to resume the resettlement of Vietnamese children of American fathers, the State Department said today.  The department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said that the accord followed talks in Hanoi earlier this week and that the United States expected the program to resume ''perhaps as early as several weeks'' from now.  The Hanoi radio, in a broadcast monitored Thursday in Bangkok, Thailand, also reported the accord on the Amerasian resettlement program.  The two countries have blamed each other for halting the program on Jan. 1, 1986. About 3,750 children and 5,400 relatives were allowed to leave Vietnam before the program ended.

"    Vietnam: What other place in the world is so much talked about and so little known? In a century of French rule, this country, with some of Southeast Asia's most beautiful terrain, somehow never got around to welcoming travelers in any significant numbers. Colonialism was followed by three decades of occupation (Japanese) and war (French, American and Chinese).  This year Vietnam, poor but at peace within its own borders, decided to end its isolation and put itself on the tourist circuit - a little tentatively, to be sure.  ''We don't promise you wonders,'' its first glossy tourist brochure says. ''We simply propose to show you a country in all its human and geographic diversities.''  But wonders are what you get: dynastic tombs, royal poetry reading pavilions over lotus ponds, mountains of marble, empty white-sand beaches that stretch to the vanishing point.  Moreover, Vietnam's towns, and most of its cities, its byways and landmarks, exude the atmosphere of an Asia that has all but disappeared. Bicycle bells and children's voices create what din there is in most towns. Before dawn along the Perfume River in Hue, and in countless other places, the only sounds are those of temple gongs or church bells.  This is a magic moment for the Westerner to visit Vietnam. People crowd around a foreigner in genuine delight. Until now, most visitors of European descent would automatically be assumed to be Russian, especially in the north and around the large American-built bases at Danang and Cam Ranh Bay, now operated by the Russians.  Tell them you are My (mee) - American - and children accustomed to chanting Lien Xo! Lien Xo! (lee-en so, which means Russian) in a not-very-friendly manner will giggle in disbelief. Fewer than 100 Americans have visited Vietnam this year as tourists, officials say, and most of them were members of study tours or potential relief donors looking at needs.  When questions come, they are direct: How old are you? Are you married? Do you have children? A group of French tourists encountered in Ho Chi Minh City had solved the identity problem by wearing T-shirts that said in Vietnamese: French. An interpreter told the story of a European who dealt with all the recurrent questions at once by having his shirt printed this way:     I am not Russian     I am Swedish     I am 30     I am single     I can use chopsticks.  In Vietnam, hosts and travelers - and one is a traveler, not a vacationer, on this jaunt -are learning together. But in almost any provincial hotel, a mere signal that the service has fallen short, as it invariably does, provokes remorse-stricken faces and a burst of celebrated Vietnamese ingenuity to put things right.  What to see? Vietnam, short of accommodations, transportation and most consumer goods, has designated a few dozen places, grouped around four or five major towns, as tourist sites. Travelers may not wander freely in the country, though foreigners wanting to travel alone by car along prescribed routes can do so, usually at about 80 cents to $1 a mile, including driver and fuel.  All details of the trip must be arranged ahead of time with one of the authorized tour operators in the United States. Flexibility is minimal in Vietnam because services are limited and the bureaucracy is overwhelming.  The selection of tourist sites has been made well, offering a sample of antiquities, natural wonders, varying ethnic regions and several beaches. All tours, ranging from 3 to about 20 days, begin in Hanoi, the capital, or Ho Chi Minh City, the country's largest metropolitan area, still known to most people (and its own tourist board) as Saigon.  In both cities there will be set itineraries and probably no choice of hotel. But the visitor with energy left should also take time to walk the streets unescorted to get a closer look at life. In the last year or two, people in Hanoi have stopped being afraid of contact with foreigners, who are free to go anywhere. Reticence has never been a hallmark of Ho Chi Minh City.  Hanoi is a rundown but architecturally uniform French colonial town - a few Soviet or modern Chinese-inpired buildings notwihstanding, and therefore a potentially more beautiful city than concrete Saigon. Bicycle-powered cyclos ply the streets for a pittance. One can be hired for an evening for a dollar or less. (Vietnamese currency has several values: about 380 dong to the dollar at banks, 550 in tourist establishments and 900 to 1,000 in the private shops of Hang Gai and Hang Gao Streets.)   If you want to sample museums, Hanoi is the place to start. The Fine Arts Museum has an attractive, systematic collection spanning the cultural history of the country. Begin on the top floor of classical artifacts and descend, in more ways than one, to the ground floor of agitprop revolutionary art.  The war museum is also a useful stop. For Americans who think there was only one conflict here, the halls devoted to the struggle against the French and battles with Chinese invaders in 1979 put the ''American'' war in context.  If you visit only one temple in Hanoi, try to make it the Temple of Literature, an 11th-to-15th-century Confucian complex that was Vietnam's first university. Although its grounds are badly in need of restoration, there are in one inner court unique stelae, looking like giant gravestones on the backs of tortoises, which record the country's literary achievements since 1443.  According to Nguyen Du Chi, an art scholar and curator at the Fine Arts Museum, the center of Vietnam's last royal dynasty and the country's classical cultural and spiritual capital, these stelae at the Temple of Literature are the keys to succeeding periods of decorative arts. Scholars go to them for the finest work of any given Vietnamese era.  Few scars of war are visible to the tourist in Vietnam; its cities, including Hanoi, were not devastated by bombing. Deforested hills around Hue, for example, are not the work of defoliants but of woodcutters fueling the cooking fires of an overpopulated country.   When transportation is available, tourists can, however, visit some areas along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which were heavily bombed and defoliated. There are also side tours of the Cu Chi tunnels outside Ho Chi Minh City, where the Viet Cong maintained underground headquarters, as well as of orphanages and war museums in several towns.  Hanoi is where most foreigners first encounter Vietnamese-style private restaurants, which are a thing unto themselves. The food in these small entreprenurial establishments is always better than hotel fare. But the ambiance and hygienic standards might best be described as medieval - some would say disgusting - because of the filth and flies.  If tables are cleaned at all, it is with a grimy rag, and sometimes you can smell the toilets. Mangy cats wander around. The squeamish may not get past the kitchen, which may be on the sidewalk out front. But once inside, there are tasty meals that should cause no problems if you order carefully and eat only hot, freshly cooked food.  Restaurants come and go in Hanoi. The hardy colony of international aid workers and diplomats, some of whom live in hotels, near the central market, which specializes in a fish-and-noodle dish; and Restaurant 202, in a residential-commercial area farther afield, where the largely French menu includes steak. With even a small tourist boom and no reversal of a more liberalized economic policy, restaurants are bound to increase and improve.  Out of Hanoi, or Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's attractions are mostly along its coast, with the exceptions of Hue and the hill resort of Dalat. The seaside scenery is remarkable in its beauty and lack of commercial clutter. This is true even of a busy resort like Nha Trang. However, Vung Tau - a day trip from Ho Chi Minh City -falls short of expectations, particularly on weekends.  From north to south, the sights most highly recommended are Ha Long Bay, near Haiphong, with its unusual rock formations and grottoes; the royal city of Hue, the beach at Danang (a city that seems to be rapidly developing into the country's most prosperous community) and, farther south, the beach at Nha Trang along the stretch of coast where the ancient Kings of Champa reigned. A small collection of Cham towers, or temples, from the ninth century is still standing on a hill above Nha Trang's small harbor.  Hue, where Buddhism thrives in well-tended pagodas, is Vietnam's most architecturally interesting city. It is also a pleasant town along the placid Perfume River, where an old American bachelor officers' quarters has become a tourist hotel, the Huong Giang.  In Hue, by the way, the best place to eat is right in the hotel - not in the air-conditioned rooftop dining room, where most tourists are guided, but in a small, open-air cafe on the ground-floor terrace known as the Specialty Restaurant. This little restaurant, run by a private owner under an unusual (for socialist Vietnam) contract with the hotel, features the local Hue cuisine, the best in Vietnam. While you eat, you can watch life on the river.  Though menus change from day to day in this restaurant, it is usually possible to find a fragrantly seasoned or spiced rice dish. The best may be the Huong Giang rice, which is lightly fried with sesame seeds, aromatic herbs, dried shrimp, onions and chilies. There are also delicious fried meat rolls you construct yourself in thin rice wafers.  Another Hue specialty is the khoai, a folded pancake that looks like a taco, with a bean paste or other filling and garnishes. After dinner, or for a snack, there might be sweet soup, a concoction of sweetened white or green bean paste, lotus seeds or fruits served cold. (Avoid the ones with chopped ice.) Well fed, the traveler can make an excursion around the pagodas, a city museum, the 18th- and 19th-century tombs of the Nguyen Dynasty in the hills outside town and the royal temples and halls inside the Citadel, the old walled city.  Three tombs are of special interest, for their variety and setting. The tomb of King Minh Mang is the oldest of the existing Nguyen tombs, built in 1840-43. All the royal burial places -more parks than mausoleums -were chosen for their tranquil settings.  Another royal tomb in a large park of lotus ponds and pagodas is that of Tu Duc, which was built in 1864-67. Within the grounds it has what is thought to be one of the few private royal theaters left in Southeast Asia. The king did not die until 1883. He had the burial park built early so he could enjoy it while living. One of his favorite pastimes was reciting poetry in a pavilion, where young Vietnamese now come to strum guitars and picnic with friends.  Most extravagant of the tombs is that of King Thai Dinh, built from 1920 to 1931. The tomb is a fantasy of styles: Hindu, European, and Vietnamese, with an interior of brilliant rococo murals made of broken porcelain from all over the world. Outside, a courtyard of life-size stone mandarins, with horses and elephants, awaits the king's pleasure.   A brief stop might be made at Hue's unusual Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Mother of Perpetual Help, which was designed by a Vietnamese architect under the old South Vietnamese regime to give a Christian building local inspiration. Two Redemptorist fathers in their 70's struggle to keep the building going with only the support of their congregation.  South of Hue, through the Hai Van (Sea Cloud) Pass winding through mountains that reach the edge of the ocean, a scenic road leads to Danang. There is a Cham museum here, but it is in need of a good curator.  Danang's beach, in sight of the Marble Mountain, with its lookout points and a cave with a Confucian temple carved into its interior, has the city's newest hotel. Called simply the Tourist Hotel (nomenclature, like bell captains, have yet to be invented here) it is on a long, sandy beach - a good place to unwind and prepare for the next leg of the trip.  Unfortunately, the hotel dining room comes close to serving inedible food and, to make matters worse, cuts off a view of the sea with curtains, leaving already spiritless diners with a view of only the barren room's Early Socialist decor. If you can swing it, here's the place for a picnic on one of the hotel's terraces, or right on the sand.  The next major resort south of Danang is Nha Trang, the rest and recreation lure of Russians now and the Americans before them. The beachfront has been carefully maintained, though many of the town's buildings have deteriorated. The beach here, unlike Danang's, has a special character: It is the town's lively and popular municipal park, where people come at dawn to do exercises and in the evening to enjoy the sea view and the breeze.  Inland from Nha Trang, a bumpy road winds through mountain passes to the Central Highlands and the hill station of Dalat, the French Empire's Simla. Here colonial administrators established a summer capital and built European-style villas on pine-covered hills overlooking a lake.  Lodgings here, more than almost anywhere else (save for Hanoi's Thong Nhat, once the Metropole, and Saigon's Cuu Long, the old Majestic,) have character. The Dalat Palace, a wood-paneled, cavernous genteel resort hotel that dominates the town center, has been lucky. It may have deteriorated physically, but for more than 40 years it has had the presence of Thai Vien. Now 67 and the manager, Mr. Vien, whose career has been unbroken since 1946, remembers the service standards of happier years and has tried to keep the Palace's spirits high against all odds.  For a very few extra dollars, you might get to stay in one of the suites, with old pewter and china still on the shelves, the way it was when guests of another era walked away from Dalat - and Vietnam.  In the morning, on a walk along misty streets with horse-drawn wagons, you can sense that age again. Like the pagodas of Hue, or picnics by the sea, the quiet landscape and relaxed people of Dalat tell a visitor that while so much is radically different now in this country, there is also much of traditional Vietnam that has survived.  PLANNING A TRIP  What to Take  Here are the things to bring along to Vietnam to help avoid frustration:  Medical Supplies. Everything you could possibly need, down to aspirin and bandages. If you are prone to motion sickness, bring tablets for the rough roads and internal flights. Most drugstore items are not available, except on the black market, if then. Also bring insect repellent or mosquito coils, as there is some malaria here, imported from Cambodia, as well as dengue fever. Cholera, hepatitis and tetanus inoculations are often recommended.  Money. A few hundred American dollars in small denominations. Even if the trip is already paid for, you may be charged for extras (excluding food), in dollars. No one ever has any change. Dollars are also used in government handcraft and art shops. Traveler's checks are rarely accepted outside major cities. Credit cards are useless.  Toiletries. Bath soap, shampoo, cosmetics, sanitary napkins, toothpaste and washing powder. If you stay in one place several nights, laundry service will usually be good, however. If you can not live without soft American toilet paper, add that. And bring rubber flip-flops for sloshy floors.  Food and Drink. Bring bottled water. Mineral water is available in some places some of the time, and local beer is safe, if warm. But while you are getting acquainted with the country, especially in hot weather, it does not hurt to have a few bottles of spa water from abroad. Travelers can get very sick in Vietnam, and medical services are minimal. Insist that locally bottled drinks be opened at the table. Also bring antiseptic towelettes. It is never impolite to clean a glass, cup, bowl or chopsticks. The Vietnamese do it with whatever is at hand.  Bring instant coffee, sugar, nondairy creamer and instant soup packets or boullion. All hotels will provide an insulated flask of near-boiling water that can be trusted. You might also bring a thermos for hot or cold drinks on the road. Some people swear by an emergency supply of jam, or tiny cans of fish or pate, with can openers. Canned foods can make a meal with bread and tea or coffee. They are also good gifts.  Cigarettes. They are useful, not only if you smoke, but also to offer as small tokens of thanks to people who will assuredly go out of their way to help you. Remember, however, that some duty-free goods - a few brands of beer, whisky, brandy and cigarettes - can also be bought in so-called dollar stores in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  Odds and Ends. Film, batteries, an alarm clock, extra pens. Paper products, from a good supply of facial tissues to notebooks, paper or plastic cups and plastic spoons.  Emergency Help  The State Department cautions travelers that the United States does not maintain diplomatic ties with Vietnam. Therefore, the usual consular services, like emergency funds or help in locating missing travelers, are not available. However, Vietnamese tourism officials say that if an American tourist faces any serious problem - an accident or heart attack, for example, the Government will notify the United States Embassy in Bangkok after tending to emergency needs. Most seriously ill foreigners who can do so leave Vietnam as soon as possible for medical care. The embassies in Hanoi of friendly countries - Britain, France and Australia -can also help in an emergency, and there is a French consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.  Crimes - thefts from hotel rooms, muggings, and the like - are almost unheard of.  Vietnam requires visas and can impose stiff penalties for those who enter the country without them. Visa processing is handled through one's tour operator and can take considerable time, up to eight months. (Visas are processed in Bangkok and Paris.) The State Department warns Americans who were born in Vietnam that they may be dual citizens and subject to military service or taxes if they re-enter the country. The advice is to carry only U.S. passports with the proper visa and nothing that identifies the traveler as a Vietnamese citizen.  Generally speaking, Americans are prohibited by the Treasury Department from doing business in Vietnam. However, personal expenditures, like transportation, lodging, meals and the purchase of goods for private use, are not prohibited. For additional details, contact the Licensing Section, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury Department, Washington, D.C. 20220; 202-376-0236.  Tour Operators  You can go to Vietnam only on a group tour. According to Nguyen Dang Quang, first secretary of the Vietnamese delegation to the United Nations, the following companies offer tours:  Indochina Consulting Group, 844 Elda Lane, Westbury, N.Y. 11590 (516-333-6662); Go Worldwide Tours, 233 Sansome Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, Calif. 94104 (415-781-3388); Orient Flexi-Pax Tours, 630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017 (212-692-9550); Philippine Airlines, 556 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036 (212-575-7850; 800-554-5444); Economy Tours, Post Office Box 18881, Irvine, Calif. 92713 (714-559-5256); Lindblad Travel, Post Office Box 912, 1 Sylvan Road North, Westport, Conn. 06881 (203-226-8531; 800-243-5657 outside Connecticut); Marazul Tours, 250 West 57th Street, Suite 1311, New York, N.Y. 10107 (212-582-9570).  Typical Costs  One 16-day trip to Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, scheduled to depart from Seattle on Nov. 2, is offered by Lindblad Travel at $2,500 a person in double occupancy. The price includes air transportion within Vietnam and Cambodia, but air fare from the United States is extra.  Individually, hotels normally cost between $15 and $35 where there are suites or other special rooms, as in Dalat. (The charges are always in United States dollars.) Food is unbelievably cheap, with the average main-course dish in most places about $1. Food and local beer can be paid for in dong, the Vietnamese currency.    - B. C.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 13   The official Vietnamese press agency said today that Hanoi had ordered the release of more than 6,000 prisoners to mark two anniversaries of national independence.  The agency did not say today what kinds of prisoners were involved in the amnesty, plans for which were first announced in August, or how many had actually been freed.  But today's announcement indicated that more than 300 people associated with the defeated regime of South Vietnam had been released in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  The report from Hanoi said that among those to be freed were 480 military and civilian personnel of the former South Vietnamese government. Saigon was captured by the North Vietnamese in April 1975, and many people were arrested in the following months.  Many Flee Country  Western diplomats say that prisoner releases are to be expected at this time of year, when Hanoi celebrates Vietnam's National Day, Sept. 2, and the Aug. 19 proclamation of the first Communist government in what was then North Vietnam.  Diplomats also say that the prisoners released may have been sentenced for security or civil offenses. Tens of thousands of political prisoners who were detained but never sentenced are thought to remain in custody.  The periodic release of prisoners in recent years has led to a surge in people trying to flee the country by boat, or overland through Cambodia.  The Hanoi radio's domestic service announced on Aug. 17 that certain groups of prisoners were due for freedom.  Categories for Release  These included people who had served two-fifths of their prison terms and who had ''sincerely repented.'' Other prisoners may have their sentences reduced, according to the August broadcast, including those who had ''reformed themselves well.''  The August statement said that other categories to be released or to have their sentences cut included prisoners who had ''recorded achievements''; people who were old or very ill; those who had ''numerous children,'' or whose children were very young, and those who had parents or others to care for who were too old and without support.  Secretary of State George P. Shultz has offered to resettle Vietnam's political prisoners, most of whom are suffering because of their involvement with a string of United States-backed Saigon regimes.  Vietnam, after first supporting such resettlement, has since backed down, saying that the issue of poltical prisoners needs to be discussed at higher levels.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 16   A former United States Congressman arrived in Bangkok today with six relatives of American servicemen unaccounted for in Laos or Vietnam since the 1960's. The group plans to release 2,500 balloons Thursday with messages offering large rewards to those who can produce a missing American.  The delegation, headed by former Representative William Hendon, a North Carolina Republican, has raised $2.4 million to offer to citizens of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to bring out any American serviceman still alive and in captivity.  ''Nothing else has worked,'' Mr. Hendon said, alluding to more than a decade of negotiations with the governments of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  In Indochina, the United States has diplomatic relations only with Laos, where 549 Americans are still listed as missing. Another 1,776 are unaccounted for in Vietnam.  The group plans to go to northeast Thailand Thursday to inflate the balloons and send them into Laos.   WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 (AP) - The State Department said today that a private group's plan to float balloons in Indochina to advertise $2.4 million in rewards for the rescue of American servicemen could hurt official efforts to account for the missing. The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, the largest group representing the relatives of the missing, also criticized the effort.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 18   For the first time since Americans fled the fall of Saigon a dozen years ago, United States officials are working in Vietnam. They are consular and immigration officials who have resumed screening Vietnamese applicants for American resettlement.  The screening, which began last week after a long freeze, was resumed after the United States agreed in August to discuss Vietnam's postwar humanitarian needs and the Vietnamese pledged to speed up the resolution of cases of Americans missing in action. Diplomats here said the American move indicated that relations between the two countries could improve substantially under Hanoi's new party leader, Nguyen Van Linh. #1,000 Interviewed Disagreements among local and national Communist Party leaders over whether to proceed with legal emigration under the Orderly Departure Program were thought to have been the cause of a freeze in the screening from January 1986 until now. The freeze also affected resettlement programs of other nations, including Australia and Canada. More than 1,000 Vietnamese were interviewed last week by the Americans, said Bruce Beardsley, who directs Indochinese refugee programs from the United States Embassy in Bangkok and who was part of the American team in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. Only nine applicants were rejected, with about 100 cases awaiting more documentation.  The next round of screening in Ho Chi Minh City is tentatively scheduled for October, when interviewing of children of American and Vietnamese couples is also expected to resume.  Eighty-one of an estimated 10,000 such young people - known as Amerasians - and their families qualify for American citizenship, United States officials said. They said Hanoi has never explained why these people, now teenagers or in their 20's, have not been allowed to emigrate.  About 670,000 Vietnamese are seeking resettlement in the United States, Mr. Beardsley told reporters today. American officials have issued letters of introduction to 95,000 of them, signifiying that they apparently are eligible for American visas. The 95,000 include some inmates of political prisons.  Prisoner Resettlement Ruled Out  The Vietnamese authorities, who reserve the right to decide which applicants will be given exit permits, are limiting interviews to family reunion cases for the moment. They rule out the release of any prisoners for resettlement abroad, saying they remain a political issue that would have to be discussed at a higher level.  But Western and Vietnamese diplomats say a number of officials of former South Vietnamese regimes who would qualify for American resettlement on humanitarian grounds were among more than 6,000 prisoners ordered released by Hanoi last week.  The most prominent of the prisoners freed was Lieut. Gen. Nguyen Huu Co, a former South Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.  The participation of Mr. Beardsley in last week's interviews in Ho Chi Minh City, along with a United States consular officer and a member of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, raised the American involvement to a diplomatic level for the first time. However, no formal relations exist between Hanoi and Washington.  Vietnamese officials said they had been pressing for this change over the last few months. Since the Orderly Departure Program began in 1979 interviewing for the United States had been done by the International Catholic Migration Agency. Other nations with diplomatic representation in Vietnam conduct their resettlement interviews through consular officials.  The procedure used by the Americans delayed the departure process, the Vietnamese said. Interviewers in Vietnam had to relay details on cases to Americans in Bangkok who then made decisions on the applicants.  The United States has resisted establishing any diplomatic presence in Vietnam until all Americans missing in action are accounted for and Hanoi withdraws its troops from Cambodia.

"      The Pentagon, responding to published remarks by a Cambodian leader, said today that if Cambodia held the remains of missing American servicemen, then it should return them to the United States.  The United States will seek, through international agencies, to verify assertions by the Cambodian, Prime Minister Hun Sen, that the Cambodian Government has the remains of many Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War, when American planes bombed Cambodia and American forces sometimes crossed its borders, a Pentagon spokesman said.  The Cambodian official made the remarks in an interview with The Los Angeles Times published on Saturday.  But a Pentagon spokesman, Lieut. Col. James Jannette, said Washington would not talk directly to the Vietnamese-backed Government about the issue because, like most nations, the United States does not recognize the regime in Phnom Penh.  ''We welcome any information on the recovery of remains which are possibly those of American personnel missing in Cambodia,'' Colonel Jannette said, reading from a prepared statement. ''We hope the Phnom Penh regime will cooperate in the return to the United States of any remains it has in its possession.''  'No One in Touch With Us'  In the published interview, the Cambodian leader asserted that the Government has ''the bones of American M.I.A.'s.'' He added: ''But no one has gotten in touch with us, so we have kept them. If the American Government doesn't come, there is nothing we can do about that.''  ''We are prepared to release them on the basis of humanitarianism,'' he said, adding that his Government would not demand recognition from the United States in exchange.  Colonel Jannette said that the United States had inquired several times, through international agencies and through the governments of Laos and Vietnam, whether servicemen's remains had been found in Cambodia and could be returned. He said there had never been any response. Inquiries by an organization representing the families of the missing also elicited no response, he said.  The United States does not have relations with Vietnam, but visits by American officials, including John W. Vessey Jr., a Presidential envoy and retired general, have helped win the return of the remains of missing servicemen.  Prime Minister Hun Sen told The Los Angeles Times that he did not know the precise number of servicemen whose remains were in his Government's possession, but said: ''We have quite a number of them. The numbers will not be a disappointment to the U.S. Government.''  The United States considers more than 2,400 personnel to be missing in action in Indochina. About 82 of these are recorded as missing in Cambodia.  In the interview, the Cambodian leader also said his Government was holding an American Vietnam veteran, Sterling Brian Bono, who disappeared in the region last spring. He suggested his Government was prepared to release him. Mr. Bono is thought to have entered Cambodia looking for a refugee he knew in Vietnam.

"    Huynh Tan Phat, a leader of the Vietcong during the Indochina war and later a senior official in the Hanoi Government, died Saturday in Ho Chi Minh City. He was 76 years old.  Vietnamese officials announced that Mr. Phat would be buried on Thursday in Ho Chi Minh City, the southern capital formerly known as Saigon.  Before the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975, Mr. Phat emerged as the chief theoretician of the Vietcong, formally the National Liberation Front, the southern, Communist-led political movement backed by North Vietnam.  Among Northern Colleagues  After the Communist victory, he was one of the few from the South to hold a leadership position in a Government and Communist Party dominated by northern Vietnamese. His positions included that of vice chairman of the Council of State.  Born in My Tho in the Mekong Delta in 1913, Mr. Phat became involved with the anti-French underground in 1936, after earning an architecture degree from Hanoi University. He was editor of the anti-French magazine, Jeunesse (Youth), and a founder of the Vanguard Youth movement.  In 1945, he joined the rebellion in the Saigon region against the French colonial government, and was arrested by the French on several occasions before going underground in 1949. He became director of the movement's information service and was named to the resistance and administrative committee in the Saigon-Cholon area.  After the defeat of the French in 1954, he returned to Saigon and established an office as an architect, but continued his political activities as a founding member and later secretary general of the Democratic Party. In 1959, he again went underground when the South Vietnamese Government of President Ngo Dinh Diem began to move forcefully against the political opposition.  Senior Positions  In 1960, he was named to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, becoming its secretary general and vice chairman of its Presidium and emerging as chief theoretician.  In 1968, he was named chairman of the Alliance of National Democratic and Peace Forces, another Hanoi-backed grouping, and in June 1969 became president of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, a shadow government set up by the Vietcong.  There was no report of immediate survivors.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: photo of Huynh Tan Phat (Camera Press)  TYPE: Obituary                      ",October 3 1989 ,11
"    A chorus of angry, righteous protests have been stirred by Britain's hard-boiled decision to forcibly bundle 51 Vietnamese boat people onto planes bound from Hong Kong to Hanoi. Governments, relief agencies, the European Parliament and now Pope John Paul II have joined in denouncing what is plainly an inhumane act.  Though Prime Minister Thatcher insists that the policy stands, the outcry has elicited a seasonal concession - no more deportations until after the Christmas holidays.  Yet those who criticize Mrs. Thatcher have not squarely addressed certain awkward realities in a poignant human tragedy. Most of the Hong Kong refugees have been driven from North Vietnam as much by poverty as by an oppressive political system. And the British are not wholly wrong in asserting that the exodus will continue as long as Vietnamese face hunger and joblessness at home.  The U.S. condemns forcible return as ''odious'' but won't provide homes for the boat people or lift a finger to change the conditions that impel them to flee. This moralism smacks of hypocrisy.  When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, the United States responded with a total embargo that sharply curtailed Hanoi's exports of raw material. Successive Administrations set several conditions for ending the embargo and establishing ties with Hanoi. They included withdrawal from Cambodia and progress on finding 2,500 U.S. servicemen still listed as missing in action in Indochina.  In September, Vietnam completed its withdrawal. Progress has been made on the M.I.A.'s. Washington now says this is not enough. It wants Hanoi to support a Cambodia policy few can understand, much less defend. That policy would force Hanoi's allies in Cambodia to share power with the mass-murdering Khmer Rouge. Vietnam has refused, and as punishment its application for an International Monetary Fund loan has been blocked by the United States.  Two courses are open to President Bush if he is to give moral and political content to American preaching about the boat people. He can take the lead in urging industrial countries to provide a home for all 50,000 refugees now in Hong Kong camps. And he can lift the U.S. veto on lending to Vietnam, whose wretched conditions are partly the result of economic sanctions.  Otherwise, Mrs. Thatcher can with some justice dismiss U.S. objections to British policy as the irrelevant mutterings of Uncle Humbug.

"   , Thailand, Sept. 2   Vietnamese leaders have asserted that they falsified the date of Ho Chi Minh's death and changed portions of his will, putting the leader's body on display in a glass mausoleum when his initial wish was to be cremated.  The Vietnamese Communist Party leader, Nguyen Van Linh, issued a statement admitting to ''a number of problems regarding President Ho Chi Minh's testament and the day on which he died,'' the official Hanoi radio said on Thursday.  The statement said that because Ho's death, on Sept. 2, 1969, fell on Vietnam's National Day, the party leadership announced that he died a day later ''to prevent the date of Uncle Ho's death from coinciding with a day of great national rejoicing.''  Mr. Linh said a section of the will in which Ho requested that he be cremated was changed with his permission before his death in 1969. When he died, his body was embalmed and placed in a glass coffin displayed in a Soviet-style mausoleum in Hanoi, the statement said, ''so that compatriots nationwide, particularly the southern compatriots and international friends, might have a chance to visit the uncle.''

"   , Vietnam, Jan. 3   The Vietnamese Communist Party Secretary General, Nguyen Van Linh, will resign at a coming party meeting, Vietnamese officials said today.  They said Mr. Linh, who is 74 years old and has been ill since late October, would step down from the party's top post for health reasons at a Central Committee session.  The officials said the meeting would be held within two months.  ''He is too old,'' said Bui Tin, deputy chief editor of the Communist Party daily Nhan Dan, adding that a Central Committee session is to be held after Tet, the Vietnamese lunar new year. He said Mr. Linh's successor would be chosen then.  'They Need Another Leader'  The three-day Tet holiday starts Jan. 27.  One Eastern European diplomat said: ''He has to step down because of his health. If they want to make the Communist Party stronger, they need another leader.''  Vietnamese officials in Hanoi said Mr. Linh has been ill since catching a severe cold during a visit to East Germany in October. He was called a reformer in the mold of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union when he was elected party Secretary General in late 1986, Officials said any decision on his successor would have to be approved at a full congress of party members, which they said would not be held until next year.  Hanoi's Hard Line on Dissent  ''There will be a swapping of posts by the top three or four at this party plenum or the congress,'' a diplomat said. ''But apart from Linh it will be the same old boys at the top.''  Vietnam, disturbed by the crumbling of Communist rule among its Eastern European allies, has cracked down on internal dissent and confirmed its commitment to building a one-party Socialist state.  Vietnamese officials declined to speculate on who would replace Mr. Linh, but diplomats said the most likely candidate was Prime Minister Do Muoi, who last month was elected deputy chairman of the National Defense Council.  Officials said Mr. Linh, a northerner, was living in the southern city of Ho Chi Minh, formerly Saigon, where he was being treated for a problem with a facial nerve.  State-run radio said Monday that he was visiting troops in the South, one of the few public appearances he has made since October.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",March 11 1990 ,11
"      Although it has been 17 years since Long Island's Matejov family got word that 21-year-old Joseph had been killed in an Air Force mission over Laos, Mary Matejov says she knows that her son survived the crash and that the United States Government knowingly lied to her about his status.  ''The Government told me he was dead, that his plane had burned to a crisp and there were no survivors,'' Mrs. Matejov said, ''and so we held a memorial service. We had no reason not to believe them until five years later, when I happened to see 'Good Morning America.' ''  It was that broadcast, which told how United States military intelligence tracked four survivors from the 1973 crash as they were being marched north, ostensibly to prison camps, that led the Matejovs to doubt the Government and its efforts to bring home American prisoners of war.  Former East Meadow Resident  Mrs. Matejov, who lived in East Meadow for 28 years before moving to Virginia last June, says she has yet to hear the truth about the fate of her son, although she feels that the broadcast and other unofficial reports proves that the United States Government knew he was still alive at least two months after she was told he had been killed.  Last month, the conviction that her son was still alive in Southeast Asia brought Mrs. Matejov to Capitol Hill, along with a half-dozen Long Island residents and other activists from throughout the country. They were here to show their support at a hearing on the first of several bills aimed at answering lingering questions about wars that ended decades ago.  Charging government cover-ups, the activists say that what happened to the Matejovs has been happening to families of missing servicemen since World War II. They see the hearing, which opened discussion on the proposed Missing Service Personnel Act and a similar bill, H.R. 3401, as a start in getting the United States to reopen its records and account for the missing men.  Case Called a Strong One  Representative Norman F. Lent, Republican of Baldwin, a member of the House Task Force on American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, said that the Matejov case was a strong one.  ''She told me about the intercepted radio transmissions indicating that a plane had crashed,'' he said, ''and my recollection was that live prisoners had been taken, one of whom could have been her son.''  Although Mrs. Matejov says she has received numerous unofficial reports about prisoners who might be her son, she has no conclusive proof that he is alive, just enough information to cast doubt on the official verdict that he is dead.  Mr. Lent added that, although Mary and Steven Matejov, a career military officer who died in 1984, had requested that their son's status be changed from dead to missing, the Air Force would not rescind its decision despite his appeals on their behalf.  According to the Department of Defense, 2,316 United States servicemen are still missing in Southeast Asia. There are 78,750 listed as unaccounted for from World War II and roughly 8,000 missing from the Korean War, 389 of whom were at one time listed as prisoners.  Government Pursuing Leads  Lieut. Comdr. Edward Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Government continued to pursue all leads in the case of missing prisoners.  ''But I wouldn't want to be the one to tell the families they have no hope,'' he said.  Although the Federal Government has officially declared as dead all American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War - except for one who is kept on the rolls as a symbolic gesture - the proposed Missing Service Personnel Act (H.R. 1730) would allow all family members to appeal that verdict and have the files on their loved ones reopened.  ''The government opposes this bill,'' Mrs. Matejov said, ''because it doesn't want it to come out how it has not told the truth at all times. That's why they don't want these cases reviewed by the families, why they don't want this legislation and why they don't want us to reopen the files.''  With 132 co-sponsors, the Missing Service Personnel Act would forbid the Government from declaring missing servicemen dead simply because of the passage of time. In addition to outlining future combat zone procedures for finding men on the field, the bill also extends to families the right to a retroactive review of their relative's case, whether they be missing in Vietnam, Korea or from World War II.  Hochbrueckner a Co-Sponsor  ''It's just like the U.S.S. Stark situation, where there was only one body not recovered, and that was Seaman Terrence Weldon from my district,'' said Representative George J. Hochbrueckner, Democrat of Centereach, a co-sponsor of the proposed Missing Service Personnel Act and a member of the House Armed Services subcommittee that conducted the hearing.  ''I know the pain that family is experiencing,'' he said. ''You spend your whole life wondering.''  Introduced by Representative John G. Rowland, Republican of Connecticut, the missing-personnel measure contains several sections that have drawn strong opposition, including its provisions allowing reviews to be open to the public and permitting any family member to request a case review, even if the next-of-kin objects.  ''Obviously, each family deals with the tragedy of a missing relative in a different way, and requiring that each case inquiry be conducted in the spotlight of public attention is both insensitive and irresponsible,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs.  Like Mr. Solarz, the National League of Families has thrown its support behind H.R. 3401, the other Rowland bill addressed at the hearing. It calls for a more deliberated Defense Department review of missing-personnel statutes as opposed to a swift code change.  League Opposes Three Bills  ''Importantly, it also protects the prerogatives of the primary next-of-kin and avoids the sensitive issue of unwarranted public release,'' said Ann Mills Griffith, executive director of the league, which opposes three of the four prisoner of war-related bills that have been introduced in the current Congress.  ''I think basically that the people of the nation feel that not enough has been done,'' Mr. Hochbrueckner said. ''This hearing is worth having to show the Pentagon that we mean business.''  H.R. 3401 is not what brought Danny DeMauro, a sales executive for the Woodbury Automotive Warehouse, to Washington, but he says that even this less drastic bill could not hurt his cause.  ''This hearing is just the beginning,'' said Mr. DeMauro, a Vietnam veteran who four years ago founded the Freedom Foundation, a small group whose mission is to bring home all missing American servicemen. ''H.R. 1730 would really make a world of difference, but that's not all we want out of Congress this year.''  Mr. DeMauro believes that another measure, H.R. 3603, which is also known as the Truth Bill, will be the greatest boon toward freeing imprisoned servicemen. The bill would force all Federal departments and agencies to disclose information, including the estimated 10,000 ''live-sighting'' reports, concerning all United States personnel classified as prisoners of war or missing in action since World War II.  Mrazek Cites Government Role  Representative Robert J. Mrazek, Democrat of Huntington and a veteran of the Vietnam War, said he would not support the Truth Bill.  ''The underlying premise is that there has been a cover-up,'' said Mr. Mrazek, adding that he believed the Government already was doing all it could to account for the missing servicemen.  In addition, the National League of Families maintains that the Truth Bill is unnecessary, since a family already has access to its relative's records. But Mrs. Matejov, who is a member of the league, says that is not not the case.  ''The Government makes you wait for information, they give you misinformation, they give you everything but an answer,'' she said.  ''If the 'Truth Bill' passes and the public gets a look at these records, there would be a huge groundswell against the Department of Defense,'' said John LeBoutillier, a former Representative ousted by Mr. Mrazek and currently head of the Skyhook II Project, an organization that sends scouts to Southeast Asia in an effort to locate prisoners of war.  Mr. LeBoutiller has endorsed the measure, as has John J. Molloy of Islip Terrace, co-founder of the Release Foundation, a group established in 1984 to bring American servicemen home.  The Domino Theory  ''Once H.R. 1730 goes through, the dominoes should start to fall in favor of these issues and for the 'Truth Bill,' '' he said. ''But then again, members of Congress might think, 'That's enough on this issue.' We've got to show them that more needs to be done.''  The Freedom Foundation, the Release Foundation and Skyhook II operate individually, although all are national in scope and are headquartered on Long Island - in Oakdale, Islip Terrace and Old Westbury, respectively. The fact that they, together with other organizations having the same goal, have not banded together, does not seem to concern Mr. LeBoutillier.  ''Why don't all the airlines get together?'' he asked. ''Why don't all the newspapers get together? They just all have a different way of getting the job done.''  Meanwhile, another Congressional subcommittee is continuing its low-key investigation into allegations of mail fraud by Skyhook II and the California-based Operation Rescue.  Such allegations do not dissuade Mrs. Matejov, who says that, far from exploiting her, many of these groups, like Mr. DeMauro's, are of great assistance.  ''With their help, I will fight this until the bitter end, for my son and for any of those men who are still over there,'' said Mrs. Matejov, the mother of 10 children.  ''In the last letter I got from Joseph, he said, 'The greatest day for me will be to see the P.O.W.'s come home.' It meant so much to him, how could I give up now?''

"    Le Duc Tho, the chief North Vietnamese negotiator at the Paris talks that led to the 1973 Vietnam cease-fire agreement and the withdrawal of the last American troops from Vietnam, died yesterday at Army Hospital 108 in Hanoi, the press attache of the Vietnam's United Nations mission, Le Dong, said yesterday. Mr. Tho was 79 years old.  The spokesman said the mission had received information that Mr. Tho had died of a serious illness, but he did not elaborate.  A Japanese news agency, Kyodo, in a dispatch from Hanoi quoted by The Associated Press, said Mr. Tho died of cancer of the throat and had been hospitalized in Vietnam since his return in April from medical treatment in Paris.  Mr. Tho, a hard-line Communist, was a member of Hanoi's Communist Party Politburo from 1955 to 1986, when he resigned in a party reshuffle, having risen to be one of the three most powerful Vietnamese leaders. He still influenced Vietnamese politics afterward. The spokesman at the United Nations mission said Mr. Tho was an adviser to the party's Central Committee at the time of his death.  Long and Secret Talks  Beginning in 1969, Mr. Tho held recurrent secret negotiating sessions in Paris with Henry A. Kissinger, then national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon. The two men initialed the armistice accord on Jan. 23, 1973, after working out its terms, and President Nixon called it ''an agreement to end the war and bring peace with honor.''  Mr. Tho and Mr. Kissinger were jointly awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for that work, though fighting between Vietnamese forces continued. Mr. Tho, the first Asian chosen for the honor, refused it, saying that ''peace has not yet been established.''  An expert on South Vietnam, he was later sent there from from Hanoi to oversee the final, victorious Communist offensive in 1975 that brought the fall of the Saigon Government and the merging of North and South Vietnam into a single Communist-ruled state. Since then, peace has prevailed in Vietnam, though many Vietnamese have fled or tried to flee.  Robert Shaplen, an American expert on Asia who interviewed Mr. Tho in 1984 in Hanoi, reported that he also directed the initial invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam in 1978.  A Truce That Did Not Last  The 1973 agreement, made possible by concessions from both Hanoi and Washington, provided for an in-place cease-fire, with North Vietnamese troops staying where they were in the south and Hanoi acknowledging Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu's role as the South Vietnamese President, pending elections.  In the meantime, Mr. Thieu's Government was to preside over the parts of South Vietnam held by the South Vietnamese Army, and Vietnamese Communists were to govern those areas where they held sway.  Other provisions of the accord included the prompt withdrawal of the 23,700-member American force in South Vietnam. Washington had cut it back, from a level of 540,000 at the end of 1968, under the policy known as the Vietnamization of the war.  The final American pullout was duly executed, but no armistice took hold on the South Vietnamese battlegrounds. As the months passed, fighting continued between the two Vietnamese sides, with each blaming the other. Further talks between Mr. Tho and Mr. Kissinger in 1973 proved fruitless.  Own and Historians' Verdicts  Recalling the talks and the fall of Saigon in 1975, Mr. Tho said in 1985 on American television that the Communist side had ''wrested total victory.'' But Mr. Kissinger, in a 1982 book, ''Years of Upheaval,'' said that at Paris the American side had ''forced a tenuous compromise.''  Summarizing the secret negotiations, he wrote that Mr. Tho ''stonewalled ingeniously for three years. And when the occasion to settle had been imposed'' by military defeats suffered by North Vietnam in 1972, ''he did so with flexibility and speed.''  Other appraisals have varied. Stanley Karnow, another expert on Asia, wrote in his 1983 book ''Vietnam: A History'' that dissension in the United States gave Mr. Tho an inherent advantage over Mr. Kissinger. ''With tolerance for the war dwindling in the United States, Kissinger could not negotiate forever,'' Mr. Karnow observed, while ''the North Vietnamese, untrammeled by domestic dissidence, were prepared to talk endlessly.''  And Mr. Shaplen contended in a 1986 book, ''Bitter Victory,'' that Mr. Tho had ''craftily outnegotiated Kissinger and, by ultimately gaining permission for North Vietnamese troops to remain in South Vietnam after the Americans withdrew, in effect set the stage for Hanoi's final stunning victory.''  A Pseudonym  The name Le Duc Tho (pronounced lay dook toe) is a pseudonym that Mr. Tho is said to have assumed decades earlier in his political career. An aura of ideological vehemence still clung to him at Paris: Mr. Kissinger, in ''Years of Upheaval,'' described him as a ''dour, dedicated revolutionary.''  Mr. Tho cut a somber figure during their talks, in his habitual black Mao suit. But he was capable of merry laughter when relaxing.  He spurred mixed feelings in Mr. Kissinger, who wrote that his adversary's ''subtlety, his acumen, his iron self-discipline,'' were admirable, and ''in all the years of negotiation with me he never lost his poise; he never made a mistake.''  ''As a professional Leninist he despised the bourgeois values of compromise I put forward,'' Mr. Kissinger observed, ''and the effrontery of his deceptions inside and ouside the conference room could be enraging.''  Mr. Kissinger has also complained that Mr. Tho ''would drop cryptic remarks'' to American correspondents ''who would then criticize their Government for not seizing the opportunity for peace.'' He has contended that, at the time, the North Vietnamese ''were working on psychology even more than they were working on a military solution.'' Declaration by L.B.J.  It was when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided to stop the American bombing of Vietnam north of the 20th Parallel, and said he was not a candidate for re-election in 1968, that Hanoi accepted his earlier proposal of talks toward an accommodation on Vietnam.  At the Paris negotiations, which got under way later that year, another North Vietnamese Communist leader, Xuan Thuy, was the country's permament representative. But members of its delegation paid obvious deference to Mr. Tho, whom Hanoi chose to be its head negotiator.  Public negotiating sessions went on and on, but proved fruitless. Meanwhile, the secret talks between Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Tho were held in villas in and around the French capital. Their existence was kept secret until Mr. Nixon disclosed them in January, 1972, in a speech criticizing Hanoi for what he termed delaying tactics.  The war heated up, and Mr. Tho and Mr. Kissinger went back to talking, again in secret. A breakthrough was achieved in October, resulting in a nine-point draft agreement.  But Mr. Nixon asked for more meetings to firm up its terms and to meet objections from the Saigon Government. Talks were resumed but broke down in mid-December.  Mr. Nixon then ordered B-52 bombing raids in the areas of Hanoi and Haiphong. They were halted after 11 days, the talks began again, and the agreement was signed after being initialed.  Mr. Tho bore other large responsibilities through much of his long political career, which began when he was a teen-ager and included helping found the Indochinese Communist Party in 1929, while France ruled Vietnam.  He went on to become a party executive in the south and the senior official there of the Vietminh organization, which fought French rule in the French Indochina War, lasting from 1946 to 1954.  Mr. Tho also had high-level responsibilities for Communist policies and operations in South Vietnam in later years. He was assigned to oversee the Communist rebel activities that began against the independent Government of South Vietnam in 1957. During 1974, he favored caution in the planning of what proved to be the final phase of the Communist war against South Vietnamese and American forces.  From Middle-Class Background  Mr. Tho was born on Oct. 10, 1911, Mr. Le Dong, the press attache, said. He was born to a middle-class family in what became North Vietnam.  A childhood friend said his name at birth was Phan Dinh Khai. After attending French-run schools, he became a minor postal official and also helped fellow Communists stir up riots.  Seized by the authorities, he spent several years in prison. During this and a subsequent time behind behind bars, his comrades included numerous Vietnamese Communist leaders.  Mr. Tho was set free in 1936 and then engaged in what an official North Vietnamese biographical sketch later called ''semi-open activities,'' becoming a regional Communist press and propaganda chief. It was in 1939 that he was jailed again. By some accounts he escaped, but the official account said he was released, in 1944. He then rose in the Communist Party leadership.  Vietnamese uprisings against the French began in 1945, and the sketch said Mr. Tho became deputy secretary of the central office of the party in southern Vietnam. He went on to become the senior Vietminh official there.  Division of Vietnam  The French Indochina war led to the defeat and withdrawal of the French, and Vietnam was provisionally divided into what became the independent North and South Vietnamese states.  The sketch of Mr. Tho said that in 1955, he went back to the North and joined the Politburo.  At the time of the cease-fire agreement it was said that Mr. Tho had been married twice, but little else was known about his personal life. His several immediate relatives included a brother, Dinh Duc Thien, who retired as a major general in the North Vietnamese Army.  Mr. Dong, the press attache, said a tribute-paying service for Mr. Tho would be held at 8 A.M. Tuesday in the Ba Dinh conference hall in Hanoi, and a memorial and funeral service would be held Wednesday morning, also in that conference hall. Burial will will be in the Mai Dich cemetery on the outskirts of the capital.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo: Le Duc Tho, the chief North Vietnamese negotiator, with Henry A.

"    Like a salesman opening up a new territory, Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's peripatetic Foreign Minister, is knocking on doors and seeking friends among America's members of Congress, diplomats, scholars and bankers, in the hope of ending Washington's trade embargo against his country.  A 66-year-old member of Vietnam's ruling Politburo and one of its main proponents of economic reform, Mr. Thach is visiting the United States for a meeting scheduled for Wednesday with Gen. John W. Vessey, the special Presidential adviser on issues involving American servicemen missing or taken prisoner in Vietnam.  At the same time, Mr. Thach is telling Americans that it is time to end the hostile aftermath of the Vietnam War and get on with normal relations. He feels, moreover, that an end to the long estrangement is finally in sight. In his words, ''there is light at the end of the tunnel.''  In vernacular American English salted with parodies of Washington cliches popular during the Vietnam War, Mr. Thach told listeners last week that no substantive issues remain to bar diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.  'Can Be Settled Easily'  ''Cambodia and the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue were the two thorniest obstacles, but I think those issues can be settled easily now,'' he said in an interview.  ''I'm going to tell General Vessey that he can have anything he wants,'' he said. ''He can go anywhere he wants in Vietnam to investigate the M.I.A. question. The only places he might not be welcome would be inside our Defense and Interior Ministries.''  Vietnam and the United States agree on keeping foreign troops out of Cambodia, he said, adding: ''At the same time, both your country and ours want to make sure that Cambodia never again experiences the genocide committed by Pol Pot's regime. We have to be sure of that. We must rely on the Cambodian people themselves to make sure the terrible slaughters of the late 1970's never recur. We Vietnamese cannot go back a second time. We have done enough to save the Cambodian people.''  The Khmer Rouge Government of Pol Pot were ousted by an invading Vietnamese Army in 1979, which established a pro-Vietnamese Government in Phnom Penh. After a decade of fighting rebel forces - including rival factions supporting Pol Pot and Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's ruler from 1953 to 1970 - the bulk of Vietnamese forces left Cambodia last year.  Mr. Thach said Vietnam would have no objection to Prince Sihanouk's return to power, ''provided the Pol Pot butchers were not part of the arrangement.''  Sees Big Changes in Vietnam  He told a group of foreign affairs specialists meeting at the Asia Society in New York on Thursday that major changes are under way in Vietnam.  ''We realized that without large reforms we could go nowhere,'' he said, ''but in this rapidly changing world, we have learned some important lessons both from China and the countries of Eastern Europe.  ''From China and the Tiananmen incident, we learned that you cannot have economic reform without political reform. From the troubles we see today in Eastern Europe, we learned that you cannot have political reform without economic reform. These reforms must go together.''  To guide Vietnam in its transformation, he said, both he and Prime Minister Do Muoi have come to rely on a Vietnamese translation of ''Economics,'' a standard college textbook written by Paul Samuelson, an American economist who won a Nobel prize in 1970. ''We keep it on our night tables as bedtime reading,'' he said.  ''In 1986 we were on the brink of economic catastrophe,'' he said. ''Today we still have formidable problems, but we have turned things around. For the first time, Vietnam has begun to export rice instead of importing it. Because we devalued our currency, we are now exporting much more than we did. And partly thanks to Paul Samuelson's book, we found loopholes in your trade embargo.''  'Government of the People'  Asked if Hanoi's reforms might soften the harshly authoritarian style of its Communist Government, he replied: ''That's an interesting question. After 40 years we have come to realize that government cannot be simply of and for the state.  ''What we are trying to do is have a government of the people, by the people and for the people. Before, decisions were made by only 100 people, and some of those decisions were nonsense. What sense is there is an economic decision that makes one duck egg equal in value to five kilograms of steel? We are ending the governmental compartmentalization that led to such rules. We know now that decisions must be made by 65 million people, not just 100.''  In fact, the structure of the Vietnamese Government remains that of a traditional Marxist-Leninist dictatorship, although its economic policies have changed markedly in the last four years.  But Vietnam's bureaucrats sometimes have difficulty adjusting to customs in free-market societies, he said.  Asking Beggar for Receipt  ''The other day a Vietnamese driver from our United Nations Mission here was stopped by one of those people in the street who ask for money,'' Mr. Thach said. ''The driver gave him something, but then insisted on having a receipt, because at home, we must account for everything. Things are done differently here.''  Asked about the Soviet military presence in Vietnam, notably the American-built naval base at Cam Ranh Bay, Mr. Thach replied: ''The big powers want military disengagement at this point, and it's not in anyone's interest to stress military involvement. The Soviets withdrew from Cam Ranh Bay last year, and we don't intend to ask them to stay on.''  Mr. Thach met on Sept. 27 and 29 with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. It was the first high-level encounter between the two Governments since the 1973 peace agreement. The Vietnamese Foreign Minister did not disclose details of his conversations, except to say they had been friendly.  But he added: ''Americans must understand that international agreements go two ways, not like the streets in New York City. In any case, we can wait a bit longer for trade and diplomatic relations if we must. International relations don't work like fast-food restaurants. It's been many years already, and we can finally see light at the end of the tunnel.''  His Movements Limited  Despite the importance attached to Mr. Thach's visit by many officials and economists, his movements in the United States have been strictly limited by the State Department, since the United States does not recognize the Hanoi Government.  Mr. Thach is permitted to visit New York since Vietnam is a member of the United Nations, but he may not travel beyond 25 miles of the United Nations headquarters. As a result, he was unable to go to an informal meeting of foreign affairs specialists arranged last weekend by a Vietnamese-American friend, Dao Spencer, at her home in East Hampton, L.I.  For his meeting with General Vessey, Mr. Thach has been cleared by the State Department to travel to Washington, but only for one day.  He dismissed such inconveniences with a smile, saying: ''One way or another, we get to talk to our American friends. That's certainly progress, isn't it?''

"      The Vietnamese Foreign Minister agreed today to expand efforts to identify and return to the United States the remains of American servicemen still unaccounted for after the Vietnam War, moving the United States and Vietnam a step closer to normal diplomatic relations.  Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach met here with several senior Administration officials, including retired Gen. John Vessey Jr., President Bush's emissary to Hanoi on matters regarding prisoners of war and servicemen who are missing in action. It was the first time that a Vietnamese official of Cabinet rank had visited Washington since the Vietnam War.  Mr. Thach was permitted to travel here for one day because the State Department lifted a travel restriction that normally allows Vietnamese officials to journey no farther than 25 miles from United Nations headquarters.  Vietnam says it wants diplomatic relations with the United States and an end to a 15-year-old trade embargo. But the Bush Administration has insisted that normalization must wait until there is a settlement to the Cambodian civil war and a resolution of the status of 1,677 American servicemen still listed as missing in Vietnam.  Greater Vietnamese Cooperation  Mr. Thach agreed to American demands that technical teams, which have been working to find remains with little success for the past two years, receive greater Vietnamese cooperation. United States officials said he pledged that the joint American-Vietnamese teams would be given free access to war records and archival materials, as well as to people who saw planes downed and other incidents by which American servicemen disappeared.  ''Minister Thach and I have had a successful meeting and agreed to new levels of cooperation,'' General Vessey said after the meeting, which lasted more than two hours. ''He has agreed to all the proposals I've made.''  Most significant of all Mr. Thach's pledges, potentially, was his reiteration and bolstering of a previous agreement to turn over remains of all American servicemen under Vietnamese control. Since September 1988, Vietnam has turned over 260 remains, and only 100 of these have been identified as Americans. Most of the others are believed to be non-American, or were unidentifiable.  The Bush Administration's movement to increase cooperation between the two Governments began in July, when it decided to open discussions with Hanoi on ways to make peace in Cambodia. Those discussions, in turn, led Vietnam to persuade the closely allied Cambodian Government to agree in principle to an arrangement under which it would share administrative power with three guerrilla groups and the United Nations until elections are held.  New Momentum for Reconciliation  In recognition of the progress to reach a Cambodian settlement, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met with Mr. Thach late last month in New York City. It was the first time senior officials of the two countries had met since 1973.  The diplomatic movement toward eventual reconciliation between the two countries appeared to pick up new momentum today. Mr. Thach also announced that Laos had agreed to cooperate with Vietnam and the United States to account for missing American servicemen.  Following the Vessey-Thach session, a senior Administration official said, ''If Vietnam is forthcoming on P.O.W.-M.I.A. affairs, then this will facilitate the rapid movement toward normalization - if and when a compromise political settlement on Cambodia is implemented.''  Government officials, however, said privately that they wondered why Hanoi has not yet released a number of remains that are believed to have been kept in warehouses. They said they hoped the Vietnamese would show those remains to the joint commission.  Ann Mills Griffiths, a leader of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, said she was gratified by the Vietnamese agreements. But Mrs. Griffiths, who attended the meeting, cautioned, ''Obviously, the results remain to be seen.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 18 1990 ,11
"   , Thailand   THERE are two Southeast Asias, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan of Thailand is fond of saying: one thriving and capitalist, the other socialist and stagnant.  So it should be no surprise that even the famously stubborn Vietnamese leadership, despite its divisions over the pace of change, has realized that it must join the development race now or be forever left behind, floundering in a politically unstable swamp of unemployment and inflation.  That is the prime reason Vietnam finally decided to cut a deal on Cambodia and withdraw the bulk of its troops after an occupation of 11 years -- to end its international isolation and attract Western investment. And it is the prime reason that Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, went to Washington recently, the highest-ranking Hanoi official to do so since the north became independent in 1954.  That year, when the French left Vietnam, Hanoi was the most modern city in Southeast Asia. In 1975, when the Americans left, the region's most advanced city was Saigon. Both cities today have a sort of aspic charm, with moldy French provincial buildings in Hanoi and American DeSoto buses still grinding through the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.  The isolation and stagnation have been the price of both war and ideology. But now Hanoi, like the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, needs the West, and seems more willing to pay the price.  Vietnam eased central controls on the economy beginning as early as 1987. But a Cambodia-related embargo on aid, investment and trade with Vietnam, led by Washington, has successfully blocked vital loans from multilateral agencies like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.  While more countries now trade with Vietnam, the American veto on the lending agencies has forestalled significant Western investment and stifled domestic development, particularly as Soviet aid declines.  A settlement in Cambodia, much more than the emotional and easily manipulated issue of the American M.I.A.'s, has always been the key to economic and diplomatic normalization between Washington and Hanoi. And only normalization will open Vietnam in a serious fashion to the West.  So it is Washington's main card with Vietnam, and even the American Chamber of Commerce, eager to do business with Vietnam, should not be surprised that the Bush Administration will continue to play it, at least until a Cambodia settlement is ratified.  Cambodia is also the main obstacle to normal relations between Hanoi and Beijing, whose support for Vietnam's revolution soured quickly over its Cambodian adventure. Hanoi's expulsion in 1979 of China's allies, the Khmer Rouge, no matter their crimes, was an insult for which the Chinese, especially Deng Xiaoping, were eager to extract the severest pain.  But China's own isolation over the killings near Tiananmen Square, coupled with the collapse of Eastern Europe and Moscow's sudden retrenchment everywhere, have also pushed Vietnam and China closer together.  Both leaderships are intensely aware of being socialist holdouts, but hope that Asian socialism will be a more lasting brand. They cite the communitarian nature of Asian societies and the fact that Communist rule rose from revolution and nation-building, and was not merely imposed, as in Eastern Europe, by a conquering army.  Still, there is an element of whistling in the dark. Vietnam's aging leaders, like China's, hope to embrace Western aid, investment and private enterprise while preserving the one-party nature of the Leninist state. But increasingly, younger intellectuals and those with more experience in southern Vietnam are expressing doubts that economic and political development can be separated -- or that the country can walk with one leg shorter than the other, as one Politburo member, Tran Xuan Bach, put it before being purged in March.  All this is taking place in the context of a leadership struggle. The party General Secretary, Nguyen Van Linh, has begun the reforms but lacks the time and strength to see them through. He has said he will retire at the next party congress, probably in May, and the battle between conservatives and reformers has gathered bite.  The conservatives, who had been grouped around Le Duc Tho, who died two weeks ago, and his brother, Interior Minister Mai Chi Tho, have used the collapse of Eastern Europe to try to brake any move toward even a Soviet-style multiparty system.  In the last five months, the Vietnamese have had a security crackdown, arresting as many as several hundred people, some for just a few days, especially in the south. They include retired soldiers of the old National Liberation Front, religious figures, businessmen and others with what the Government calls ""too much"" contact with Westerners.  While the internal crackdown has now eased somewhat, there continues to be a public campaign about the reported efforts of ""reactionary forces overseas"" to sabotage the state and socialism. Two weeks ago, a court in Hanoi convicted 38 people of trying to overthrow the Government with the help of Thailand and of Vietnamese exiles based in the United States.  While these people represent no real threat to the regime, the trial is apparently being used to justify the crackdown and serve as a warning to others, including the Western-leaning reformers in the leadership, among them the urbane Mr. Thach.

"      The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and seven other Democratic and Republican Senators have written to President Bush requesting the lifting of the 15-year-old trade embargo on Vietnam.  The letter comes at a time when the Administration is slowly building relations with Vietnam, having recently opened talks with Hanoi to help resolve the Cambodian civil war and reinvigorating joint efforts to identify and return American servicemen still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.Two weeks ago, the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, became the first Vietnamese official of Cabinet rank to visit Washington since the war.  The chairman of the committee, Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who is probably the most influential Republican in the Senate on foreign policy matters, complimented the Administration's efforts ""for the expansion of contacts,"" but said it was time to quicken the improvement.  ""The time has come for putting the Vietnam War behind us and opening anew chapter in U.S.-Vietnam relations,"" said the letter of Oct. 29, which was also signed by Senators Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, and Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon. ""We urge you to act promptly to lift the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam and we pledge our full support.""  The Administration had no immediate comment on the letter. It has consistently said normalization of diplomatic and economic relations canoccur after Vietnam helps account for 1,677 American servicemen still listed as missing and the Cambodian civil war is settled.  Washington has urged Hanoi, the primary backer of the Cambodian Government, to push Phnom Penh to join three guerrilla groups in an interim coalition Government until United Nations-sponsored elections can be held.  The letter from the Senators said the Administration was mistaken to link the Cambodian conflict to an improvement in relations with Vietnam.  ""We should not allow the prolonged end game in the Cambodian peace negotiations to prevent us from taking the next step of lifting the trade embargo with Vietnam,"" it said. ""Conclusion of a comprehensive peace in Cambodia, establishment of a substantial U.N. presence, and conduct of free andfair elections in war-torn Cambodia could take years.""  The Senators wrote that they were not entirely satisfied by the Vietnamese position on the war dead and prisoners of war, but that ""we have seen considerable progress in recent months.""  The letter continued: ""In addition, we are heartened by the significant support for market economic principles that has been demonstrated by some members of the Vietnamese Government. These developments warrant a significant U.S. response.""  The letter should reinforce increasing pressure from a growing number of American business executives and economists who argue that Vietnam could become a significant trading partner.

"      The United States said today that it was ready to start formal talks with Vietnam on normalizing relations as soon as the next major step toward peace in Cambodia is completed, possibly next month.  Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon said full diplomatic relations could be achieved within two years if Hanoi also made satisfactory steps toward pinning down the fate of the 2,300 Americans who have not yet been accounted for since the Vietnam War.  ""This is a process that we see moving in stages,"" Mr. Solomon said at a conference on business prospects with Vietnam. He said full normalization could come once a democratically elected government takes office in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  North Vietnam defeated the American-backed South Vietnamese Government in 1975, and the United States has never established normal diplomatic relations with the Hanoi Government.  U.S. Moving Cautiously  Mr. Solomon said Washington was moving cautiously to generate domestic support for normalization, notably among the families of servicemen still listed as missing in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.  He said that to speed the process Vietnam should immediately turn over the remains of servicemen to which it has access, share wartime records and help resolve what are called ""discrepancy cases,"" which relate to the fate of Americans who were reported captured alive but did not return.  ""We look forward to a new era in Indochina and for U.S. relations with Vietnam, with Camodia and with Laos,"" he said. ""Such a new era is only months away, we hope."" The United States already has full diplomatic relations with the Government of Laos, an ally of Hanoi.  The immediate condition to opening normalization talks is the signing of a United Nations-sponsored plan to end the 12-year war in Cambodia. Solomon said he hoped the 19 nations involved in the process would sign in Paris as early as next month.  The timetable announced by Solomon was based on stepped-up American-Vietnamese contacts in recent months. In September, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach met in the highest-level talks between the two countries since 1973.

"   , Thailand, May 20   Joseph Marie Cardinal Trinh Van Can, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Hanoi, died of a heart attack on Friday, the official Vietnam News Agency reported today. He was 69 years old.  The Cardinal died at his office in the Vietnamese capital, said the report, monitored here. A funeral will be held in Hanoi on Wednesday. The report said he was the founding president of the Vietnam Episcopal Council and the apostolic administrator of Hue Province, in central Vietnam, and of the dioceses of Hung Hoa, Thai Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces, in the north.  The Vatican said Pope John Paul II sent a telegram of sympathy to Vietnam's Auxiliary Bishop, Francois Xavier Nguyen Van Sang. Cardinal Can was born on March 13, 1921, in Ha Nam Ninh Province, southeast of Hanoi. He entered the priesthood in 1949, was made co-adjutor to the Archbishop of Hanoi in February 1963 and elevated to Cardinal in June 1979.  The authorities have eased restrictions on Catholics and other believers since Nguyen Van Linh became Communist Party chief in late 1986.

"      Pushed by Vietnam War veterans, Congress is reopening a debate on normalizing economic and diplomatic relations with Hanoi.  The opening salvo is a piece of legislation introduced by Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, that would remove legal restrictions on travel to Vietnam and four other nations - Cambodia, Cuba, Libya and North Korea.  Veterans groups around the country have testified in favor of the legislation and have begun to urge their members to write supporting letters to their representatives in Congress. The legislation is expected to be considered by the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the July 4 recess.  ''This is the first step towards Congress's getting over its trauma over Vietnam,'' said Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut, chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. ''There is no reason we can't review our relationship. Veterans groups are leading the charge.''  Mr. Gejdenson's subcommittee, which is handling the travel legislation, is at the forefront of Congressional efforts to normalize relations. In a small gesture toward that end, the subcommittee recently removed language in PL-480 Food for Peace legislation that prohibited the sale of American food and other commodities to Vietnam.  Since losing the Vietnam War 15 years ago, the United States has not pursued normal diplomatic relations with Hanoi. The Bush Administration has said it is not opposed to normalizing ties once a complete removal of Vietnamese military forces from Cambodia can be verified.  The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia, then ruled by the Khmer Rouge, in 1978 and installed the Hun Sen Government. Vietnam announced the withdrawal of its troops last September, but persistent reports have indicated that elite Vietnamese combat units still back the Hun Sen Government in its war against a guerrilla insurgency consisting mainly of the Khmer Rouge.  A State Department official who deals with East Asian affairs said that now would be a bad time to send friendly signals to Hanoi, given the stepped-up diplomatic activity to resolve the Cambodian conflict.  ''We need leverage'' to make sure Vietnamese forces leave Cambodia, he said. ''It would be unwise to act unilaterally to satisfy Vietnamese demands.'' The United States would like to see a coalition, backed by an international peacekeeping force, replace the Hun Sen Government.  Currently, under the Trading With the Enemy Act, it is illegal for commercial or non-profit tour groups to organize or advertise trips to Vietnam. Individuals may travel legally to Vietnam on their own. But without the help of people experienced in dealing with the Vietnamese, they often have trouble arranging visas and hotels.  Allied with the Bush Administration opposing the Berman bill, which is called the Free Trade in Ideas Act, are Cuban exile groups opposed to liberalizing travel to Cuba.  A growing number of legislators disagree with the Administration position. Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, said that liberalizing travel and trade with Vietnam made sense ''from every angle'' because it would not only help moderate Hanoi's foreign and domestic policies but would also enable relatives of Americans missing in action to visit Vietnam to press their search for information.  Mr. Hatfield said the Berman bill ''could be a triggering action toward normalizing relationships because it does have the support of those who in previous times were against normalization, like the veterans groups.''  Don Mills, from Akron, Ohio, told the committee: ''Twenty years ago, if I didn't go to Vietnam I was threatened with jail, and now if I want to go to Vietnam I am threatened with jail.''  Mr. Mills has helped organize tours of Vietnam for more than 200 veterans. The Treasury Department has warned him that he may be prosecuted unless he halts his activity. A letter sent to Mr. Mills from the Treasury Department said he could face up to 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $50,000.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",June 5 1990 ,11
"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   Fifteen years after North Vietnamese tanks smashed into Saigon's Presidential Palace, there are still two Vietnams. The Republic of (South) Vietnam, that artificial creation of French colonialism and cold war politics, is no more. But commercial capitalism, the American presence and the Viet Cong-led insurrection pressed a distinctive subculture onto the South. The political ramifications endure.  No American is a total stranger in Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon is now officially known. English is widely spoken. Ordinary Vietnamese greet Americans with surprising warmth. And even for those who weren't there ''before 1975,'' as the local euphemism puts it, locales made familiar by war movies and the nightly television news are everywhere.  The first glance of my room at the old Majestic Hotel brought back memories of the opening scenes of ''Apocalypse Now,'' when Captain Willard lies in a similar hotel room contemplating his assigned mission up the Mekong River. Just a few blocks away, the former U.S. Embassy, its rooftop helipad intact, is occupied by a state petrochemical company. Nearby is the old Presidential Palace, now offering guided tours.  Two other museums present the official history of the war from the Communist side, displaying captured American aircraft, tanks and high-tech artillery pieces and recounting the atrocities committed by the U.S.-backed Southern regime.  But many old-time residents of Saigon have different memories from the pre-1975 years. There is little evident bitterness over a costly and futile war. Instead there is a kind of nostalgia for what, from today's vantage point, seem happier, more prosperous times. Those rosy recollections indict the economic failures of Communist rule. The Communist leadership itself acknowledges those failures and for four years has been encouraging market-oriented economic reform.  That has not only unleashed the strong commercial instincts of the South but has also begun to spread private economic activity northward to Hanoi, for 35 years a bastion of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy. In a reversal of the pattern of the 1960's, today's infiltration routes run from south to north.  The irony would be more delicious if economic reform had not been coupled with a nasty political backlash. Vietnam's Communist rulers are prepared to tolerate capitalist economics. But, frightened by the example of Eastern Europe, they fear any accompanying decentralization of political power.  A wave of arrests earlier this year has chilled political discussion. A disproportionate number of those arrested appear to be Southerners, including many who were closely associated with the Communist movement before 1975.  Vietnam was isolated from the outside world for more than a decade after the war, thanks to an American-sponsored economic embargo and hostile international reaction when Hanoi invaded and occupied Cambodia. Now Vietnamese troops are back home. Western trade and investment are on the rise. Deals with Visa and MasterCard have recently been signed, although Americans are still prohibited by United States law from using such credit cards or doing business in Vietnam, or even placing phone calls to that country.  Those policies, large and small, are overripe for review, especially since the United States is now beginning a dialogue with Vietnam. The psyches of America and Vietnam are tied too closely together for lasting estrangement.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",August 10 1990 ,11
"   , Thailand, Sept. 1   American-Vietnamese teams have finished their longest joint search ever for the remains of missing American servicemen, the official Vietnam News Agency said today.  The search, conducted from Aug. 6 to 31, involved more teams and specialists than ever before, said the report, monitored in Bangkok.  United States forensic experts examined 70 sets of remains that the Vietnamese said they had previously found on their own searches. The Vietnamese agency did not say what the outcome was. Any remains that might be those of Americans missing from the Vietnam War are flown to United States military laboratories.  The American experts are from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, both Hawaii-based agencies that try to account for the wartime missing.  The Pentagon lists 2,300 Americans missing from the war in Indochina, which ended in Communist victories in 1975 in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. About 70 percent are missing in Vietnam.  The latest joint search was the 11th since the first one in September and October 1988.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 2 1990 ,11
"    You thought it was 1990, and the enemy was Iraq. No. For some policy makers in the Bush Administration it remains 1975, and the enemy remains Vietnam. There's no other plausible explanation for the Administration's self-defeating decision to extend the U.S. economic embargo against Vietnam for one more year under the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917.  The embargo prevents Americans from most trading with Vietnam or with Vietnamese nationals abroad. American companies cannot organize tours to Vietnam, and individual American travelers cannot use credit cards.  There are limited exceptions for humanitarian activities and gift packages to individual Vietnamese. But U.S. phone companies can't provide service to Vietnam, a cruel hardship for Vietnamese here who want to stay in touch with family members.  The Vietnam War is over. The cold war is over. Washington and Hanoi have begun cooperating productively in efforts to achieve a political settlement in Cambodia. Progress is also being made on humanitarian issues, from the orderly departure of Vietnamese refugees to the search for remains or traces of American soldiers missing in action. Meanwhile, Vietnam is pursuing a serious program of market-oriented economic reforms. Businessmen from anti-Communist bastions like Taiwan and Singapore are moving aggressively to profit from Hanoi's liberal foreign investment code. American business organizations are pressing for an early end to the U.S. embargo, which punishes them at least as much as it punishes Vietnam.  U.S. restrictions have helped keep Vietnam one of the world's poorest countries, feeding the mass exodus of refugees toward Hong Kong and the countries of Southeast Asia. The pressure is sure to grow in the coming months as Soviet aid is scheduled to be cut back drastically. Some argue that the pressure could spark a revolt against Communist rule. More likely, increased economic contacts with the West would increase pressure for democratic political reform.  The Bush Administration made just that argument last spring when it extended China's trade privileges in the face of Beijing's post-Tiananmen hard line. The same logic applies even more clearly to Vietnam, which is moving toward reform.  Congress has no say over the Administration's action, which came by executive order. But Representative Howard Berman of California, recognizing that person-to-person contacts can advance democratic values far more efficiently than embargoes, has introduced a bill that would ease U.S. travel restrictions for countries where Americans face no special dangers. Renewal of the embargo against Vietnam shows how badly such reform is needed.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: EDITORIAL                      ",September 16 1990 ,11
"    In their highest-level discussions in more than a decade, the United States and Vietnam took what appeared to be a significant step toward the resumption of diplomatic relations yesterday.  Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, talked for 30 minutes at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in what a senior State Department official said was ''an exceptional meeting.''  The official said the meeting was ''a step in the direction'' of normalization of relations, but that it technically ''did not constitute the commencement of normalization discussions.''  Travel Restrictions Waived  The United States has not had normal diplomatic relations with Vietnam since North Vietnam's defeat of the United States-supported South Vietnamese Government in 1975. In the late 1970's, President Carter sent Leonard Woodcock, the head of the United Auto Workers Union, to Hanoi to discuss the renewal of relations, but the effort ended when Vietnam invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978. Since then talks between Washington and Hanoi have been conducted by middle-level officials.  At the meeting yesterday, Mr. Baker waived the travel restrictions imposed on Vietnamese diplomats to allow the Foreign Minister to travel to Washington to meet with Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is the President's special envoy to Hanoi on humanitarian issues. Two Stumbling Blocks The Administration wants the Vietnamese to cooperate more fully on solving the issue of 2,300 servicemen who were listed as missing in the war in Indochina or who failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps. About 70 percent of those men are missing in Vietnam, with the remainder missing in Laos and Cambodia.  That and the Cambodian issue are the two main stumbling blocks to the normalization of relations. The Bush Administration has tied renewed relations to verification of a complete removal of Vietnamese military forces from Cambodia.  At his meeting with Mr. Bush, Mr. Thach promised that Vietnam would withdraw all its troops and advisers from Cambodia and work to solve the conflict.  In a communique after the meeting, the Vietnamese said the two countries agreed ''to take concrete steps that are conducive to the normalization of relations between the two countries.''  The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said, ''The Secretary urged the Vice Premier to accelerate Vietnam's unilateral efforts to resolve the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue, thereby pre-positioning both countries for improved relations once a Cambodian settlement is achieved.''  The Vietnamese, who said that Mr. Thach would travel to Washington in two weeks after meetings with other world leaders in New York, praised the outcome of the meeting.  ''Both sides reiterated their support for an early agreement on Cambodia in the Paris International Conference,'' the Vietnamese statement said. ''The two sides also agreed to accelerate the resolution of humanitarian issues of mutual concern, including the M.I.A. and the humanitarian needs of Vietnam.''  Prisoner Issue Stressed  The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia, then under the control of the Khmer Rouge, in 1978 and installed the Hun Sen Government. Vietnam announced the withdrawal of its troops last September, but there have been reports that some units and advisers remain to assist the Hun Sen Government in its war against the Khmer Rouge-dominated guerrilla movement.  The Secretary and Foreign Minister began by discussing prisoners of war and the missing in action, State Department officials said.  ''The Secretary emphasized his and the President's personal commitment to the fullest possible accounting,'' a senior official said.  ''The pace and scope of normalization will be directly effected by progress on this issue,'' the official said. ''To emphasize the priority that the President and the Secretary give to this issue, the Secretary said he was prepared to make an exception to our travel restrictions that normally keep Vietnamese officials within 25 miles of New York City.''  The waiver would allow the Foreign Minister to hold a one-day meeting with General Vessey and Ann Mills Griffith of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.  The Foreign Minister has also received an invitation to meet with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  U.S. Stand Reiterated  The second part of the discussion centered on a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia.  ''The Secretary reiterated our standing position that normalization of relations with Vietnam could take place only in the context of a political settlement in Cambodia, again with the pace and scope of normalization affected by the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue,'' the senior State Department official said.  The official said progress had been made in the last few weeks on the Cambodian problem.  ''Vietnam has played a constructive role in these developments,'' he said. ''Much more remains to be done as we move first to an agreement that would be signed at a Paris conference and beyond that to full implementation of that agreement.''  Mr. Baker told Mr. Thach that he saw a satisfactory conclusion to the Paris conference on Cambodia as an important step toward the establishment of diplomatic relations, State Department officials said.  ''The Vietnamese have heard this before, but I think it was important for them to hear it from the Secretary,'' the senior official said.  The Next Step to Peace  Vietnam's recent decision to cooperate with the United States in resolving the conflict in Cambodia was a major factor that led to the warming of relations, American officials said.  They said the next step in the peace process there would be final agreement on the composition of a Supreme National Council.  The issue ''hanging up final action'' has been the number of people who should be on the council and who should head it, the senior official said. ''That subject was discussed,'' he added.  Mr. Thach briefly raised the issue of the United States economic embargo against Vietnam, State Department officials said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo: Secretary of State James A.

"    Bui Tin was at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, when Ho Chi Minh's Viet Minh Army defeated French colonial forces to secure an independent Communist North Vietnam. Bui Tin was in Saigon, in April 1975 accepting the surrender of the South Vietnamese Government that paved the way for reunification under Communist rule. Now, Bui Tin is in Paris, calling for an end to Marxist-Leninist economic planning and political repression in statements broadcast back to his homeland over the BBC.  Bui Tin's long journey reflects a growing disillusionment among important Vietnamese Communists with Hanoi's failure to deliver on its revolutionary promises. His words deserve serious consideration by his political superiors, rather than the abuse and punishment that is the dissenter's usual lot in Communist Vietnam.  Mr. Tin was a close associate of Ho Chi Minh. So was Vo Nguyen Giap, the military architect of Dien Bien Phu and of Hanoi's victorious war in the South. Mr. Giap is similarly impatient with the timidity of Hanoi's reforms. So are numerous former Viet Cong leaders and other Communists with historic ties to the old South.  These people have been loyal and convinced Communists for most of their lives. But unlike some of the career Communists now climbing the ranks of power in Hanoi, these old revolutionaries embraced Communism because they saw it as an ideal means to achieve independence, reunification and economic development.  Today Vietnam is an impoverished bystander amid Southeast Asia's economic boom. And the political divisions between North and South, Communist and non-Communist remain acute. It should not be all that surprising to see people like Bui Tin breaking ranks.  Mr. Tin faces almost certain persecution when he returns. He reports that his family has already been interrogated. Impeccable revolutionary credentials failed to save other Communist critics of the regime from arrest during last spring's sweeping purge. Many longtime Communists find it easier to suppress any misgivings and enjoy the rewards available to members of the nomenklatura.  Yet those who are honest with themselves cannot believe that present-day Vietnamese Communism has much of a future. Ideology and a heavy-handed bureaucracy stunt economic reform. Democracy remains illusory. The real issue is power, not economic or political theory. Those calling the shots in Hanoi insist on centralized control.  Bui Tin now challenges their power head on. He calls for a ""real democratization and opening,"" in contrast to the window-dressing undertaken so far. He even speaks of a government of national reconciliation, including anti-Communists who have fled Vietnam since the Communist takeover.  Anti-Communists may find it difficult to work with even the most reform-minded Communists. Yet Mr. Tin gives voice to the deepest hopes of millions of Vietnamese. Given recent events in the Communist world, his more orthodox comrades would be foolhardy to ignore his bold advice.

"    To the Editor:  Cokie Roberts's ""Why the M.I.A.'s Live On"" (Op-Ed, Sept. 20) will only provide more ammunition to those for whom the Vietnam War is not over. The hype and public attention surrounding this issue only mask the chauvinism of reactionaries who wish to extend the Vietnam War into the 1990's, now that the cold war is over.  There is little concrete evidence that any American soldiers are held against their will in Southeast Asia. And the Vietnamese Government has already bent over backward to assure Americans that it will do its utmost to facilitate the finding and return of remains of dead American soldiers.  Lest we forget, Vietnam is an impoverished land, and it must deal with an enormous debt, with high rates of infant mortality, with poverty and disease (much of it caused by the conflict that is known in Vietnam as the American War).  It is unconscionable that Americans would make the return of servicemen missing in action the top priority in their relations with Vietnam. The United States has yet to pay one cent of war reparations as stipulated by the Paris Treaty of 1973.  Vietnam has to contend with more than 300,000 of its own as missing, and the wave of human exodus in Southeast Asia, caused not only by poverty but also by United States intransigence in settling the Cambodian conflict, shows the Administration's declarations to be not only insulting but also clearly the chauvinistic (not to mention racist) ploy they are -- reminiscent of the ""they do not value human life as we do"" attitude of the Vietnam War years.  To give some perspective to this issue, we should consider that there are more than 8,000 American soldiers still listed as missing in the Korean War and almost 80,000 from the European front in World War II.  And yet we don't see this Administration making grandiose pronouncements about scouring the European countryside for remains of American soldiers.

"    To the Editor:  In ""Vietnamese Refugees, Reconsidered"" (editorial, Oct. 8), you go to great pains to point out the obvious fact that no country can let in everyone who wants in, and that governments are constantly forced to make decisions on returning illegal immigrants to their homeland. The difficulty in this case lies in the fact the ""homeland"" happens to be Vietnam.  On this very distressing issue the United States wields a triple-edged sword: the United States will not accept ""economic migrants,"" strongly condemns and opposes any move to return ""economic migrants"" to Vietnam, and at the same time obstructs Vietnam's attempts at improving its economy, which is the root cause of ""economic migrants.""  Although armed hostilities between the United States and Vietnam ended more than 18 years ago, the United States continues to wage war against Vietnam by maintaining an economic embargo on Vietnam. It has not been a war to protect our national security interest: it is a war of retribution. It has not been a war against the Government of Vietnam but against the people of Vietnam. Governments do not feel pain; people do. More than half of Vietnam's 67 million people were not even born when the last United States troops left Vietnam, yet we continue to punish them.  Vietnam is one of the poorest countries in the world. Over the last five years, Vietnam has been pursuing a policy of economic reform. However, today Vietnam's reforms are at risk.  Over the last several years, Vietnam has painstakingly followed the rigid structural readjustment program prescribed by the International Monetary Fund with such success that most members of that institution are ready to resume lending activities to Vietnam. The single voice that prevents this type of assistance and coerces other countries to follow its lead is the United States.  Six months ago (not ""last year,"" as you stated), the United States presented Vietnam its plan for normalization. The United States plan conditions normalization on peace in Cambodia and on progress on the issue of servicemen missing in action.  There is every indication that the tragic war in Cambodia will formally end with the signing of a peace agreement in Paris within the next few weeks. Members of the United States M.I.A. team in Hanoi have been given permission to travel to any province or village in Vietnam in search of remains and to have access to Vietnam's military archives. (One can only imagine the Pentagon's response if the Vietnamese asked to look at our archives with the hopes of finding some information on their hundreds of thousands of servicemen missing in action.) What more do the Vietnamese need to do before the United States releases its stranglehold on their economy?  You support forced repatriation while absurdly stating that the prospect of normalization ought to be an incentive to Vietnam to treat its returnees decently. Of the more than 13,000 (not 6,000, as you say) Vietnamese asylum seekers who have returned since 1989, there is no evidence whatsoever that Vietnam has not been treating them humanely and with dignity. Indeed, international organizations that monitor the returnees have not reported any instances of returnees being treated as anything less than decently.  The most humane course of action open to the United States is clear: lift the embargo and allow the international financial institutions to assist Vietnam. Through increased economic opportunities and an end to Vietnam's economic isolation, the incentive to flee would be greatly diminished. By doing this the United States becomes part of the solution and ceases to be an obstacle to resolving this issue.  ROBERT O.

"      Eighteen years after American troops withdrew from Vietnam in humiliation, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that the United States was prepared to begin talks with Hanoi next month to normalize relations.  Mr. Baker said progress in the talks would depend on Vietnam's willingness to furnish information that Washington has long sought about 2,300 Americans who were prisoners of war or are listed as missing in action.  With the Soviet Union cutting its aid to Hanoi, Vietnam's Communist Government has been eager to restore diplomatic relations with the United States to end an American trade embargo and get international aid to rebuild an economy ravaged by war and mismanagement. Vietnam is also eager to end its international isolation.  But the United States has refused to normalize relations as long as a Vietnamese-backed Government in Cambodia resisted a negotiated settlement to its civil war. After Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge, the United States supported a rebel movement that sought to topple the regime in Phnom Penh.  Baker May Visit Vietnam  In Paris today, for the signing of a 19-nation peace treaty intended to end two decades of civil war in Cambodia, Mr. Baker said he was taking into account Hanoi's support for the settlement in agreeing to pursue normalized relations.  American officials have said it is possible that Mr. Baker will visit Vietnam at the end of November as part of a previously scheduled trip.  ""The scope and pace of these discussions of course will be governed by the degree with which Vietnam continues to cooperate with the United States on the very, very important issue of our prisoners of war and our missing in action,"" Mr. Baker said.  Re-establishing relations with Vietnam remains a sensitive issue for many Americans who remember the wrenching war in which more than 58,000 Americans died. Many Americans accuse Hanoi of continuing to conceal information about Americans missing in Vietnam as a result of the war.  Timing for Normalization  In 1975, two years after American troops withdrew, the Communists captured Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, putting an end to America's efforts to keep a non-Communist Government in what was then South Vietnam.  Mr. Baker said the normalization talks could begin ""in the next month or so."" Showing how sensitive the subject is, Mr. Baker talked in gingerly terms, saying Washington was ""prepared to begin discussions with Vietnam concerning the issues and modalities that would be involved in normalizing relations.""  One American official said normalizing ties could take several years, but Vietnamese officials said they hoped diplomatic relations could be established much sooner.  After decades of battling the Japanese, French and Americans, Vietnam is one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita income of about $200 a year. Vietnamese officials were irritated last week when the United States blocked a French proposal calling for the International Monetary Fund to lend money to Vietnam.  'Progress' Needed on M.I.A.'s  Washington's icy relations with Hanoi thawed a bit in July when Hanoi allowed a M.I.A. liaison office to open in the Vietnamese capital. In addition, there have been several joint American-Vietnamese searches for the missing soldiers.  An American official said today that in meeting Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, Mr. Baker said ""substantial progress"" in the missing-in-action issue was needed as a condition for normalizing ties.  Signaling the improvement of relations, Mr. Baker said today that he would ease the trade embargo against Vietnam by allowing ""U.S.-organized"" travel to Vietnam by individuals and groups like veterans, journalists, business executives and tourists. Washington began the embargo against North Vietnam in 1964, and extended it to the whole country in 1975.  He also said he would lift the travel ban that prohibits Vietnamese diplomats to the United Nations from traveling more than 25 miles from New York.  A Four-Step Process  Mr. Baker said the moves toward normalized relations would be a step-by-step process. In April the State Department outlined a four-step process for normalizing relations with Vietnam. The signing of a Cambodian peace agreement was the initial step required to begin normalization talks. For the second step, after a cease-fire was begun in Cambodia and the United Nations transitional administration was established in Phnom Penh, Washington would partially lift its trade embargo.  The department said the third phase would start after six months of United Nations administration in Cambodia. In this phase, the trade embargo would be lifted, and Hanoi and Washington would exchange diplomatic missions.  In the fourth phase, Washington would establish full diplomatic and economic relations after elections in Cambodia, scheduled for early 1993, were held under the supervision of the United Nations.  Mr. Baker also met today with China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. An American official said Mr. Baker had discussed weapons policy, human rights and trade policy. The officials said Mr. Baker had voiced his concerns about China's plans to sell missiles to Syria and about China's practice of selling goods made by prison labor.  Mr. Baker told reporters that he was keeping open the option of visiting China, a position that American officials say helped make the Cambodian peace treaty possible.

"    Eighteen years after American troops withdrew from Vietnam in humiliation, Secretary of State Baker said the United States was prepared to begin talks with Hanoi next month to normalize relations.  He said progress would depend on Vietnam's willingness to furnish information about 2,300 Americans who were prisoners of war or are listed as missing in action.

"      Despite improved cooperation, Vietnam could do much more to aid the efforts of American investigators searching for clues about servicemen unaccounted for in the Vietnam War, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today.  The Bush Administration has linked the pace and scope of normalizing relations between the two former enemies to Hanoi's cooperation in resolving the highly emotional issue of missing Americans in Southeast Asia.  The other major irritant in American-Vietnamese relations was alleviated last month with the signing of a Cambodian peace accord; Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said then that Washington was ready to open talks on restoring relations with Hanoi, which installed and supported Cambodia's Communist Government.  Promises Only Partly Fulfilled  Testifying at the first of a series of hearings by a special Senate committee investigating the fate of missing Americans, Mr. Cheney said that American field investigators ""find that public pronouncements of increased cooperation by Hanoi do not produce satisfactory arrangements on the ground.""  ""Promises to cooperate on live sightings, improved helicopter transportation and complete access to historical records remain only partially fulfilled,"" said Mr. Cheney.  ""The pace and scope of normalizing relations with Vietnam will depend upon the extent of cooperation by the Vietnamese on P.O.W.-M.I.A. matters,"" he said.  Team of Searchers Grows  In the past several months, as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have expressed greater willingness to assist American investigators, the Defense Department has increased the number of investigators, analysts and other workers assigned to the cases of missing servicemen to nearly 240 from 134.  Of the 2,273 servicemen still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, the Pentagon classifies 1,172 as missing. The other 1,101 are believed to have been killed in action, but their bodies have not been recovered.  Even with broader access to Vietnamese records and inspections of suspected crash sites, Pentagon officials repeated their assertion that they have found no evidence that any servicemen remain in captivity.

"      The head of the United States office in Hanoi told a Senate committee today that some American servicemen were left behind as prisoners in Vietnam at the end of the war, but that there is no proof that any of them are still alive.  The official, Garnett E. Bell Jr. of the Office for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, said that between 1973 and 1975, the United States began receiving reports ""that Americans were still being held, but they were unconfirmed.""  Testifying before the Senate committee investigating the fate of the 2,273 servicemen listed as missing in action from the Indochina war, he said evidence gathered since then convinced him that the initial reports were true.  Asked how many Americans were left behind, Mr. Bell replied, ""Possibly 10 or less.""  Mr. Bell's report contradicts statements two decades ago by the Government that all prisoners of war had returned home and everyone else was presumed dead.  Mr. Bell did not discuss the circumstances under which the Americans were held, or what has been learned of their fate. However, he said his office has no proof that any Americans are still alive in Vietnamese captivity.  LOAD-DATE: November 7, 1991  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",November 6 1991 ,11

Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon will head the American delegation at the talks in New York; the Vietnamese will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai.  Last month, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said that the mood of reconciliation in Cambodia opened the way for talks with Vietnam on normal relations. Also cited was a more cooperative attitude by Hanoi on providing an accounting for Americans missing in action since the Indochina war.  Today, the department's deputy spokesman, Richard Boucher, reaffirmed that ""the pace and scope of normalization will be directly influenced by Vietnam's cooperation on the POW-MIA and other humanitarian issues.""

"      The leader of a Vietnamese delegation that has been meeting American officials says Vietnam hopes that it will be able to establish normal diplomatic relations with the United States in the next six months.  The Vietnamese official, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, said in an interview on Friday that his discussions at the United States mission to the United Nations on Thursday with Richard H. Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, were ""quite productive and constructive."" He added that he had invited Mr. Solomon to come to Hanoi for the next round ""at any time convenient to him.""  He also said several teams of American experts were expected in Hanoi in December and January to work on remaining issues of contention -- in particular the resolution of the cases of 2,273 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina since the Vietnam War. This issue, a sensitive political topic in Washington for years, has derailed talks many times in the past.  No Rights Discussion  Mr. Mai said the talks in New York did not include human rights questions.  ""We say these are purely questions to be decided by Vietnamese,"" Mr. Mai said of human rights issues. ""However, I do understand the concerns of the Americans.""  A State Department summary of the talks with the Vietnamese issued on Thursday said that in six hours of discussion, the two sides had focused on the United Nations peace plan now being put into effect in Cambodia and ""the fullest possible accounting of our P.O.W./M.I.A.'s.""  The United States wants to see free elections held as planned in Cambodia in 1993 before a full diplomatic relationship is established with Vietnam.  The statement added that Washington hoped that Vietnam would address ""humanitarian issues of importance to the United States,"" but it did not give details. It also said progress had been achieved since April, when Washington produced a ""road map"" to normalization.  Politically, Vietnam remains a rigidly authoritarian state, although it has made efforts to open its economy to outside investment. Hanoi's leaders have also recently made some overtures to cultural figures, suggesting that they are willing to relax restraints on expression. It was reported in Bangkok this week that a well-known writer, Duong Thu Huong, had been released after seven months in detention for possessing ""anti-socialist literature.""  But the Vietnamese authorities have announced no change in their plans to try Nguyen Dan Que, a physician in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, who has been imprisoned twice for trying to form a human rights organization. His trial on treason charges is scheduled to begin on Nov. 29.  Mr. Mai would not comment on these cases.  The Vietnamese delegation asked the United States to consider lifting its embargo on Hanoi's participation in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank ""in stages,"" Mr. Mai said. He said Washington continued to tell foreign governments prepared to support such moves that ""the time was not right.""  The Vietnamese and American delegations agreed to set up a permanent working group to meet from time to time on specific issues.

"   , Thailand, March 4   A second senior and widely admired Vietnamese intellectual has criticized the leadership in Hanoi, calling for individual freedoms, younger leaders and changes in the system.  Nguyen Khac Vien, 78 years old and one of Vietnam's best-known historians, submitted a petition to a party meeting in January that described the current leadership as ""totally impotent, plunging the country into disorder and preventing all development.""  Mr. Vien's petition recently circulated in Paris, where a copy was obtained by Agence France-Presse.  In the petition, Mr. Vien said that the Communist Party should loosen its hold on the state, from which it is now inseparable, and should provide ""freedom of the press and of thought, and freedom of association,"" as well as the right to demonstrate and strike.  The Politburo and party Secretariat ""do not understand that many comrades are too old, physically inept and incapable of following the changing times,"" Mr. Vien wrote.  ""Unless a set of broad-based rules for democracy are drawn up and implemented, the country will never be able to stand alone and compete with its neighboring countries,"" he wrote.  He did not, however, call for a multiparty system in Vietnam, which the leadership has consistently rejected.  Educated in France, Mr. Vien was director of Hanoi's Foreign Languages Publishing House and of Vietnamese Studies, a review founded in 1964 and translated into English and French. He has written such books as ""Contemporary Vietnam"" and ""The History of Vietnam,"" as well as introductions to anthologies of Vietnamese literature published for foreigners.  Now retired and living in Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Vien's criticism is notable because it comes while he is still living in Vietnam. In December, Bui Tin, deputy editor of the official newspaper, Nhan Dan, made less precise criticisms in a petition he issued after leaving Vietnam and taking up residence in Paris.  In his petition, Mr. Tin urged the Hanoi leadership to give up ""great utopian illusions"" of an ill-defined socialist society and instead to concentrate on national reconciliation and economic development. ""It is time to build a democratic system based on the people,"" Mr. Tin said.  Mr. Tin's petition created a stir, in part because it was he who accepted the surrender of the South Vietnamese Government at the Presidential Palace in Saigon on April 30, 1975. But his decision to criticize from abroad allowed the Vietnamese leadership to dismiss it more easily.  LOAD-DATE: March 5, 1991  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",March 4 1991 ,11
"   , Vietnam, April 20   The United States has agreed to establish its first official presence in Vietnam, President Bush's special envoy for humanitarian affairs said here today.  The official, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., in a statement issued with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, said Washington would establish a temporary office in Hanoi to resolve cases of American soldiers who were listed as missing in action or taken prisoner during the Vietnam War. But differences over Cambodia continue to stand in the way of opening normal relations, American officials say.  ""In keeping with the discussions we had in Washington, we agreed that the United States would establish a P.O.W.-M.I.A. field office in Hanoi on a temporary basis,"" General Vessey said.  Reading the statement after two days of talks with Mr. Thach, he said both Governments wanted to normalize relations and would continue talks on the subject.  ""Minister Thach and General Vessey both reaffirmed their Governments' desire to normalize relations and agreed on the importance of continuing discussions to resolve differences between them,"" the statement said. ""They agreed that it would be useful for them to meet again, at a date to be determined.""  But Mr. Thach gave a noncommittal answer when asked by reporters whether he had agreed to a plan presented by the United States, under which Washington would normalize relations with Hanoi in exchange for Vietnam's cooperation in insuring that a United Nations peace plan succeeded in Cambodia.  ""I have not accepted and I have not rejected,"" he said.  General Vessey and Mr. Thach were officially meeting about the war prisoners and those missing in action, an issue that the Bush Administration also sees as an obstacle to normalization.  It wants Hanoi to help account for 2,278 American soldiers who are listed as missing, were taken prisoner, or are known to have been killed in Indochina, including 1,661 in Vietnam.  The joint statement said General Vessey had expressed American appreciation for Vietnam's cooperation in improving efforts to resolve the issue.  ""At the same time, General Vessey expressed the hope that even further progress and greater results can be obtained in the future,"" the statement said.  Washington says the biggest stumbling block to normalization is the Cambodian dispute. It wants Hanoi to make its ally in Phnom Penh back the United Nations peace plan, which provides for disarmament of Cambodia's army and of guerrilla groups before elections.  Western diplomats said the American delegation expected a response from Mr. Thach to a four-phase plan presented in Washington last week to Vietnam's United Nations delegate.  Under the American ""road map"" to normalization, Vietnam would virtually have to insure peace in Cambodia before the United States would normalize relations.  The United Nations plan would have to be carried out, Cambodia's warring factions disarmed, elections held and a national assembly formed before full relations were established with Vietnam.  Western diplomats in Hanoi said that Washington was demanding too much of Vietnam and that Hanoi officials were discouraged over short-term prospects for normalizing ties.

"      The Bush Administration said today that it would provide financial assistance to Hanoi for the first time since the Vietnam War, approving a small but symbolically significant aid package for Vietnamese disabled during the fighting.  The announcement that $1 million would be made available for artificial limbs comes less than a week after the two nations agreed to open an office in Vietnam to resolve the cases of American soldiers missing since the war. It represents one more cautious step in a slow warming of relations that began two years ago.  Ties Hinge on Cooperation  Administration officials reiterated that an initiation of full diplomatic relations or the lifting of a 15-year trade embargo would hinge on Hanoi's cooperation in accounting for all missing American soldiers and in reaching a diplomatic settlement to the civil war in Cambodia.  But in the statement announcing the aid, Richard H. Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, also pointedly expressed appreciation for Vietnam's program of economic reforms.  State Department officials said the Agency for International Development would funnel the $1 million in aid through private American humanitarian groups, which will produce the artificial limbs in Vietnam.  The limbs will go to people who suffered their wounds during the Vietnam War, including soldiers from the North and South Vietnamese armies, members of the Vietcong and civilians.  Officials said the program would be similar to efforts for the disabled in Afghanistan, Uganda and Mozambique. They said they could not estimate how many people would be treated.  ""It's a sign of new cooperation,"" said a State Department official who monitors Vietnam. ""But it is not a step toward resuming diplomatic relations."" No Government officials will be sent to Vietnam to work on the aid program, he added.  Mr. Solomon told the Senate subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific affairs that the United States had conditionally pledged aid involving artificial limbs and child care in 1987, when Vietnamese and American officials first agreed to work together on accounting for the missing soldiers.  ""We have found some improvements in cooperation, but limited results,"" Mr. Solomon said, ""and Vietnam really needs to accelerate unilateral and joint efforts to achieve the results we are seeking.""  Role of Office in Hanoi  Referring to the temporary office on M.I.A.'s that will be opened in Hanoi, he said: ""It will have no diplomatic or political responsibilities, and should not be seen as a first step in the normalization process. It can, however, help to accelerate normalization once a Cambodia settlement is signed.""  The United States still lists some 2,276 Americans as missing or unaccounted for in the Vietnam War. Since August 1987, Vietnam has turned over more than 288 sets of remains, but only 117 have been identified as those of Americans. Most of the others were judged not to be the remains of Americans or could not be identified.  Ann Mills Griffiths, executive secretary of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, said the aid program was ""a very positive move,"" adding: ""We are hopeful the temporary office may facilitate greater results. But that is up to the Vietnamese.""  Gen. John Vessey, the special envoy to Hanoi on prisoners of war and the missing, has focused on 119 ""discrepancy cases"" in which the United States believes that soldiers were seen alive after their planes were shot down or they were otherwise separated from their units.  Progress in 13 Cases  Kenneth C. Quinn, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State who is working with General Vessey, told the Senate subcommittee that American-Vietnamese technical teams had made progress in 13 of those cases by digging up remains and retrieving other evidence.  Economic aid to Vietnam has long been a center of controversy. During negotiations with the Carter Administration in 1977, Vietnam insisted that the United States had an obligation to contribute billions of dollars toward the country's postwar recovery.  The Vietnamese based their claim on two documents. One was the Paris cease-fire agreement of 1973, which pledged American support for Vietnam's reconstruction. The second was a letter sent by President Nixon to Prime Minister Pham Van Dong after the cease-fire that reportedly pledged more than $4 billion in food and reconstruction aid.  Neither the Ford nor the Carter Administration accepted Hanoi's argument, maintaining that its invasion of South Vietnam in 1975 broke the cease-fire agreement.  The prospect of diplomatic ties vanished in December 1978, when Vietnam invaded Cambodia to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot. But relations slowly began to improve in 1989, when Hanoi removed the last of 140,000 Vietnamese combat troops from Cambodia.  Although Vietnam still provides a considerable number of military advisers to Phnom Penh, the Bush Administration moved to increase cooperation last July by opening talks with Hanoi on ways to make peace in Cambodia.  U.S. Licenses Aid Groups  Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went a step further that month when he said the Administration would encourage private American groups to offer humanitarian aid to Vietnam. The Administration has since licensed 36 organizations or individuals to provide $4.3 million in relief.  Administration policy drew a good deal of criticism today from both Republican and Democratic senators.  Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Vietnam veteran and a Democratic critic of the Administration's Vietnam policy, welcomed the announcement.  But the senator, who will travel to Hanoi next week, suggested that the Administration was ""holding the people of Vietnam and our own relationship and our own benefits that we gain from it a prisoner -- not just to our feelings about the Vietnam War, but prisoner also to the Cambodian conflict.""  He said the missing soldiers could be more rapidly accounted for if the Administration expanded its trade and communications with Hanoi.  Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, asserted in testimony before the subcommittee that United States intelligence agencies had not been aggressive enough in following up ""live sighting reports"" of American servicemen who could still be alive in Vietnam.  Talk of Sighting P.O.W.'s  Mr. Smith complained that the agencies had ""repeatedly denied"" Congressional requests to review ""first-hand accounts from refugees who say they have seen American P.O.W.'s in captivity in Southeast Asia, some as recently as January 1991.""  Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, said he agreed with Mr. Smith. ""I'm not criticizing Vietnam as much as I am our own Government,"" Mr. Helms said, referring to information on the missing servicemen. ""I've never heard as much double-talk as I have gotten each time when you try to reason or learn something from our Government.""

"   , Va.   Sixteen years ago tomorrow, North Vietnamese tanks rolled into Saigon, ending a struggling democracy and handing the U.S. its most complete international humiliation. It is painful to recall how many Americans welcomed South Vietnam's fall, believing the Communists' war effort was driven more by a desire for national unification than by totalitarian ideology.  Those who accepted such assurances from Hanoi's leaders had some justification. After all, ""independence and freedom"" had been Ho Chi Minh's slogan. The Communist negotiators in Paris had shared a Nobel Peace Prize for the 1973 accords, which specified that ""the South Vietnamese people's right to self-determination is sacred, inalienable, and shall be respected."" They said that ""the South Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and democratic elections under international supervision.""  The results of North Vietnam's conquest were, of course, markedly different. The Communists sent almost the entire young leadership of the South into re-education camps, where many thousands died and the strongest languished for a decade and more, only to return as virtual non-citizens. Even their children still suffer discrimination; according to the International League for Human Rights, one in three South Vietnamese is categorized as ""compromised because of family ties.""  The Communist Government aligned itself closely with the Soviets and gave them their first warm-water naval bases in the Pacific. It developed a disastrous state-run economy that allowed no individual initiative and made Vietnam one of the world's poorest nations.  Internally, it continues to preach hatred toward the U.S. and those who fought alongside us. One need only visit the former residence of President Nguyen Van Thieu -- now an ""exhibition house"" of U.S. ""war crimes"" -- to see how vitriolic the propaganda remains.  These failed policies have caused unprecedented criticism from within the party, which is struggling to find new solutions to the nation's problems. Respected voices such as that of the now-exiled Bui Tin, an army colonel and deputy editor of the party daily, and Nguyen Khac Vien, Vietnam's best-known historian, have urged officials to embrace democratic freedoms or face, as Mr. Vien put it, ""the last chance of the party to continue its leading role."" He said that ""otherwise, nothing can prevent its degeneration.""  In response to the criticism and to reduced Soviet aid, Hanoi permitted economic liberalization, which has stirred the beginnings of rejuvenation, particularly in the south. But Hanoi has also intensified the repression of political dissenters. The International League for Human Rights reports that a wave of arrests that began a year ago has grown into the largest such campaign since 1975.  Nguyen Dan Que, a prominent physician arrested last June, has spent 10 of the last 12 years imprisoned without charges for leading a nonviolent democracy movement like those in Eastern Europe. When Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska repeatedly asked to see him while visiting Vietnam this month, he was coolly rebuffed by the chairman of the Council of Ministries, Do Muoi, and Interior Minister Mai Chi Tho. I was with Senator Kerrey, and the official message conveyed to me after a five-day wait was that Dr. Que was ""recently arrested,"" that he was still ""undergoing interrogation"" and that it would be inappropriate for him to be visited from ""the outside.""  That this decision came directly from the Interior Minister indicates how tightly even nonviolent dissent is controlled. In other areas of national life, Hanoi officially proclaims equal treatment of its citizens, but officials implementing Government policy, carrying hatreds from the war, seem to practice de facto apartheid: Those who served the former South Vietnamese Government and their families are denied employment, education and medical benefits.  Bui Tin, frustrated with the lack of movement toward democracy, says the leaders ""don't need good advice -- they need psychiatric help."" He says, ""They are . . . there for self-interest and not the common good."" But Washington has not pressed this issue; instead, it has focused on Vietnam's external affairs rather than on demanding better treatment for those who fought alongside us.  For example, although the State Department announced last week that $1 million will be earmarked for much-needed prosthetic aid for amputees in the south, it received no guarantees that former South Vietnamese soldiers will get such help.  Richard H. Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, announced earlier this month that the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations could begin as soon as Hanoi met two conditions -- that it help end the Cambodian civil war and that it invigorate the effort to resolve the issue of Americans still missing in action.  While both conditions are important, neither is relevant to the reasons we severed relations in the first place. Nor will they help those who fought at our side; Hanoi considers its treatment of those ""compromised because of family ties"" an internal matter and has not put it on the table. But the plight of those suffering because of loyalty to the U.S. is not a matter our negotiators should waive. We simply cannot turn a blind eye to past commitments.  The restoration of relations with Vietnam involves complex emotional, diplomatic and economic issues that are perhaps without precedent in our history. We have never before abandoned an ally on the battlefield -- an ally, incidentally, whose casualty rate was 40 times ours -- and not returned. It would be ironic if we normalized relations as a reward for Vietnam's support of free elections in Cambodia while not addressing the need for democracy -- and full equality -- in Vietnam itself.  This is not to say normalization should not occur. There are sound humanitarian and economic reasons to become involved in Vietnam again. Moreover, Vietnam's loosening of economic restrictions has U.S. business worried that other countries will make irreversible inroads.  Japan is exploiting the economic liberalization. Last year, 2,000 Japanese Chamber of Commerce members visited Vietnam, and 15,000 are expected this year. France, Singapore and Australia were visibly represented during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City, which is beginning to radiate a hopeful vibrancy after the years of war and internecine retaliation.  But unless an agreement that allows U.S. investment to flow freely into Vietnam also guarantees that the benefits flow to all Vietnamese -- especially our former allies and their families -- that agreement would be viewed as little more than capitalist greed, a prop for the regime and reinforcement of the shame felt by those who supported us.  Vietnam is the great unfinished morality play of our time. The main issue the renewal of relations poses is whether we can sort through past errors while not forgetting the sincere intentions of our failed effort to preserve South Vietnam from Communism. The coming months offer Americans, no matter what their position on the war, a chance to show respect for those whom we abandoned under fire, keeping the faith when we did not. And many have paid grievously behind a wall of silence whose terrors are only now beginning to be fully unveiled.

"      The head of a Pentagon intelligence unit assigned to account for United States servicemen missing in Vietnam has resigned, accusing Bush Administration officials of seeking to discredit and perhaps even cover up reports of sightings of Americans in the country.  The Army officer, Col. Millard A. Peck, left his job on March 28, stapling an unusual memorandum and farewell note to his office door that charged that his department was being used as a "" 'toxic waste dump' to bury the whole 'mess' out of sight and mind in a facility with limited access to public scrutiny.""  The resignation after only eight months in the job was first made public in a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early April. Details of his memo were reported last week in the Washington Times and in The Los Angeles Times today.  The unit run by Colonel Peck was the Defense Intelligence Agency's Special Office for Prisoners of War and Missing in Action.  In his memo, Colonel Peck, a highly decorated veteran of three tours in Vietnam who has spent more than 20 years in the Army, faulted Administration officials for failing to pursue leads. ""The mindset to 'debunk' is alive and well,"" he said. ""It is held at all levels, and continues to pervade the P.O.W.-M.I.A. office.""  He added: ""A cover-up may be in progress. The entire charade does not appear to be an honest effort and may never have been.""  The United States still lists nearly 2,300 Americans as missing in action or unaccounted for in the Vietnam War, and President Bush has called resolution of the problem one ""of highest national priority."" Although the resolution of the contentious issue is not a condition for the improvement of relations between the United States and Vietnam, the ""pace and scope"" of the process is related to the cooperation of the Vietnamese in accounting for the lost American servicemen.  The Pentagon has opened an investigation into Colonel Peck's allegations, and will withhold all public comment until the investigation is completed, a Pentagon spokesman, Lieut. Col. Steve Roy, said today. But, he added, ""There have been seven inquiries into the role of the Pentagon in investigating sightings of M.I.A.'s and P.O.W.'s. Those inquiries essentially have found that we were acting correctly and were fully committed to the process.""  Colonel Peck did not return phone calls to his new office in the Military District of Washington, which provides administrative services and ceremonial functions for all military activities in the Washington area.  Three Republican senators, -- including Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa -- have charged that the Pentagon has long been involved in a conspiracy to cover up evidence of Americans still living in Vietnam.  Since the end of the Vietnam War, successive administrations have consistently defended their highly skeptical approach to reports that Americans have been seen in Vietnam.  Senior Bush Administration officials say that the yearning by families of missing servicemen for any information about their loved ones has spawned a number of scams by unscrupulous Vietnamese, including an odious trade in human bones and offers to provide help in locating servicemen in return for sponsorship for permanent residency in the United States.  In his memo, Colonel Peck singled out Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, for particular criticism. Ms. Griffiths, whose brother has been missing since 1966, he said, ""occupies an interesting and questionable position in the whole process,"" because of her access to ""top secret, code-word message traffic"" even before D.I.A. officials receive it.  In recent years, some others have criticized Ms. Griffiths and her organization for taking the side of the Pentagon instead of the families of the missing servicemen. In response to Colonel Peck's charges, Ms. Griffiths said today that ""Accusing an M.I.A. sister of impeding the effort is ludicrous.""

"      An internal investigation has found ""no foundation"" for an Army colonel's assertion that the Government has deliberately made a charade of the effort to resolve P.O.W. and missing in-action cases stemming from the Vietnam War, the Defense Department said today.  The charges were leveled by Col. Millard Peck of the Army, who resigned in mid-April from his Defense Intelligence Agency job as director of the Special Office for Prisoners of War and Missing in Action. He had bitterly accused the Administration of making his office nothing more than a ""dump to bury the whole mess out of sight and mind.""  The Administration's efforts to follow leads of sightings were a ""charade"" and a ""travesty,"" Colonel Peck wrote his superiors in a departure memo.  The colonel, who has since been reassigned, did not offer any evidence in his memo that any of the 2,276 Americans listed as missing in action or unaccounted for since the Vietnam War were alive.

"      The Administration has begun a diplomatic effort around Southeast Asia to check the veracity of a photograph that supposedly shows that three American flyers missing since the Vietnam War may still be alive, officials said.  The blurry black-and-white snapshot shows three mustachioed men posing in a woody setting with a white sign marked with the numbers ""25-5-1990,"" which may be meant as the date May 25, 1990. There is nothing visible in the photo that definitively establishes the location, time or identity of the men. Nevertheless, relatives of three American listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia said today that the men shown in the photo were their relatives.  Since a copy of the photograph was made public by a former Vietnam War prisoner of war on Monday, it has added fuel to a growing contention in Congress and among some veterans groups that the Administration should work harder to account for the missing in action.  Administration officials said it would take time for Federal Bureau of Investigation technicians to determine whether the photograph appears to be authentic, and they note that the picture could have been faked by people hoping to receive a reward from relatives and P.O.W.-M.I.A. groups for the information they offer. But they say they are taking the picture seriously because American officials have received several reports from around Southeast Asia that the three men have been seen by witnesses.  'Hard Not to Take It Seriously'  ""The body of information pertaining to this case is quite extensive,"" Carl W. Ford, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, told a House subcommittee today. ""There is so much of it that it's hard not to take it seriously.""  Mr. Ford said the Pentagon received the original photograph late last year from a ""confidential informer"" who did not divulge how he received it. Officials said they hope they can trace the snapshot to the person who took the photograph and to where it was taken with the help of Vietnamese Government officials.  The State Department has sent the photograph to Trinh Xuan Lang, the Vietnamese representative to the United Nations, asking that his Government look into the matter. Kenneth Quinn, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, has been instructed to seek to enlist the cooperation of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in investigating the purported sightings of the men.  Family members told reporters at a news conference today that they were certain the photograph showed their relatives, now two decades older than the last time they saw them.  Photo Sparks High-Level Interest  ""There's no doubt in anyone's mind that they are who they are,"" said Albro L. Lundy 3d, who says his father, Maj. Albro Lundy Jr. of the Air Force, is one of the three men shown in the photograph. Major Lundy was shot down in Laos in December 1970, and listed as killed in action.  The other servicemen who supposedly appeared in the picture are Col. John Robertson of the Air Force and Lieut. Larry Stevens of the Navy. Colonel Robertson, who was shot down in September 1966 over North Vietnam, and Lieutenant Stevens, who was shot down over Laos in February 1969, have both been listed as missing.  The release of the picture has sparked a high-level interest among several members of Congress.  ""It's a very strong photograph,"" Rep. Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, said at a House hearing on P.O.W.-M.I.A. issues today. He called it ""an issue of the very highest priority to the Congress.""  Senators John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, held a joint news conference today announcing that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had requested that the Pentagon provide all relevent intelligence documents on servicemen still missing from the Vietnam War.

"      Vietnam says that one of the men in a photograph that supposedly shows three missing prisoners of war is dead and that his remains were given to the United States last year, the Pentagon announced today. But forensic experts have been unable to make a positive identification.  The Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said the Hanoi Government reported that the remains of Col. John L. Robertson of the Air Force were given to United States officials in April 1990.  That would be a month before what some people have suggested may be the date of the photograph. A copy of the photograph made available by the American Defense Institute, a private organization in Alexandria, Va., shows three men in a wooded setting holding a sign with a cryptic message that says, among other things, ""25-5-1990.""  ""In this specific case, we have never made a positive identification of the individual that Vietnam says they've identified,"" Mr. Williams said. ""They say it's one of those three people in the picture. We have never made that determination.""  Poor Quality of Photo  The remains in question were among those of 10 servicemen given to the United States last year, Mr. Williams said. But of those, only one set has been identified, he said.  Several relatives and others have said they believe the three men are missing American servicemen being held in Southeast Asia. But the Pentagon has said it is unimpressed with the evidence so far.  Pentagon officials said one of the problems is the poor quality of the photo, which is three or four times removed from the original.  The men who supposedly appear in the photograph are Colonel Robertson, of Seattle, shot down on Sept. 16, 1966, over North Vietnam and listed as missing in action; Albro L. Lundy Jr., an Air Force major from Sherman Oaks, Calif., shot down on Sept. 16, 1966, over Laos and listed as killed, and Larry J. Stevens, a Navy lieutenant from Canoga Park, Calif., shot down on Feb. 14, 1969, over Laos and listed as missing in action.

"      The Defense Department said today that Vietnam had sent back animal bones, not human remains, in the case of a man purportedly in a snapshot showing American servicemen missing since the Vietnam War.  But the department said it had concluded that the man in question, Col. John L. Robertson of the Air Force, is dead. Colonel Robertson is one of three pilots shot down over Southeast Asia who is said by relatives to be in the photo, which was made public this week. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that efforts to authenticate the picture had been inconclusive.  Vietnam, which has been asked by the United States to help investigate the picture, said on Thursday that it had turned over Colonel Robertson's remains in April 1990.  But a Pentagon spokesman, Comdr. Edward Lundquist of the Navy, said today, ""That set of remains was subsequently determined to be nonhuman, mammal.""

"      The release of a photograph supposedly showing three lost Vietnam War fliers has stirred new moves in Congress to examine the Administration's efforts to account for thousands of Vietnam War servicemen, even though some members express doubt about the picture's authenticity.  The wave of publicity surrounding the grainy photograph of three men with mustaches standing in a woody setting has caught the Administration off guard and produced an awkward response. Several Government officials expressed reservations about the photograph, saying it might have been a hoax by Southeast Asian bounty hunters seeking monetary rewards from American groups that cling to the hope that American servicemen are still alive in Southeast Asia.  Nevertheless, the Administration has dispatched a 10-member Pentagon team to Thailand to find out the circumstances under which the photograph was supposedly carried across the Thai border into Cambodia, and has sent urgent pleas to Vietnam and Laos to help investigate the case.  ""This is one P.R. battle we can't win,"" a Pentagon official said.  Of the 2,273 servicemen still unaccounted for, the Pentagon considers 1,172 as missing. It considers the 1,101 others as killed in action, but their bodies have not been recovered.  ""There certainly could be live Americans there, but if there are, I don't know about them,"" said Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., President Bush's envoy to Hanoi on the issue of prisoners of war and those missing in action.  The Doubts Only Grow  Over the last three years, General Vessey has persuaded Vietnam to repatriate 122 sets of remains and to help resolve dozens of other cases by opening archives and allowing investigations of locations where live sightings reportedly occurred. But the doubts only seem to grow as the American-Vietnamese cooperation fails to come up with any live people.  The issue has long inspired great emotion, from American Legion halls to the homes of wives and children who cling to the hope that loved ones are alive. Charges that senior Government officials have conspired to cover up evidence of servicemen held in prison camps, caves and cages have persisted through the last four Administrations, although the motivation for such a conspiracy stretches the imagination.  The conspiracy theories were reinforced by the departure in February of Col. Millard A. Peck of the Army, who was chief of the Pentagon intelligence unit assigned to investigate missing American servicemen. In a farewell memorandum he complained that the Administration failed to follow up many leads and suggested that ""a cover-up may be in progress.""  After the release of the recent photograph, Hanoi added to Washington's quandary by saying that it had already delivered the remains of Col. John L. Robertson of the Air Force, one of three pilots believed to be shown in the picture. But the bones Vietnam turned over last year were animal remains, the Pentagon said, stoking claims that Vietnam is still hiding prisoners.  Authentic, Families Say  Pentagon officials note that the three fliers look unusually well nourished for having been held in captivity for more than two decades. Some photography experts say the head of the man standing in the middle is out of proportion, suggesting his picture was taken separately from those of the other men. Other analysts have noted that the cryptic sign held up by the men appears to have been photocopied and pasted on the picture.  The families of Colonel Robertson, Maj. Albro L. Lundy Jr. of the Air Force and Lieut. Larry James Stevens of the Navy say unequivocally that the snapshot is authentic. But many other families maintain the servicemen shown are their relatives.  The origins of the photograph remain a mystery. It was first released publicly last week by Eugene (Red) McDaniel, a former prisoner of war and director of the conservative American Defense Institute, who has long charged the Government with covering up the existence of the missing servicemen still alive in Southeast Asia.  Mr. McDaniel said he received his copy last November by courier from an American private humanitarian aid worker who obtained it at a refugee camp along the Thai-Cambodian border. The aid worker would not identify the source of the photograph, Mr. McDaniel said, but indicated that two of the men in the picture, Colonel Robertson and Lieutenant Stevens, had been held by a Cambodian businessman who somehow had obtained custody of them and was demanding $500 for anyone to see either of them at a Phnom Penh pharmacy. It was not clear from this account how the servicemen had escaped from their original captors.  Soon after Mr. McDaniel obtained the photo, an aide said, the two servicemen apparently were recaptured and returned to a prison camp in Vietnam.  ""The reason the picture came to me is because my organization offered the reward,"" Mr. McDaniel said. ""For the Cambodian businessman, this was strictly a business deal.""  Administration and Congressional officials have criticized Mr. McDaniel for raising the hopes of relatives by releasing photos in the past that he said showed live American servicemen but that turned out not to be authentic.  The Pentagon originally received the photo by fax machine last November from a naturalized American of Cambodian descent living in Los Angeles. A Defense Intelligence Agency official provided Colonel Robertson's daughter, Shelby Robertson Quast, with the name of the man who transmitted the photograph. A friend of her family said that Mrs. Quast met with the man and that he gave her two contacts in Cambodia and a handwritten note demanding $2 million for two of the three men.  Mrs. Quast flew to Phnom Penh to track down the two contacts. She found one, who maintained he took the photograph when he was a prison guard. He said he would try to free the men, but then in a second conversation he told her he could not fulfill his promise.  'Huge Credibility Gap'  ""I'm a bit skeptical about the photo,"" said Representative Sam Johnson, Republican of Texas. But he said its disclosure ""graphically illustrates why we must declassify M.I.A. files."" Mr. Johnson is one of several legislators who have demanded that the Pentagon release classified intelligence to Congress and family members.  ""There is a huge credibility gap within the veterans community and within the American people at large,"" said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a Vietnam veteran, soon after the photograph's release. ""The United States Congress has a right to know whether our citizens are being tortured unfairly by a process that is denying them information.""  Mr. Kerry and Senator Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, who also served in Vietnam, jointly called on the Administration to release two decades' worth of classified reports on supposed live sightings of American servicemen. They announced that the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations would hold hearings in September to review charges that the Defense Department and State Department have mishandled the search for the missing.  The two Senators are part of a coalition of liberals and conservatives pressing for greater Congressional monitoring of the Administration's handling of the issue.

"      Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, today dismissed charges that the Administration was not committed to finding surviving Vietnam War servicemen and he said there was no credible evidence that Vietnam still held any American prisoners of war.  It was the strongest comment so far by an Administration official on the emotionally charged question of whether there are any Americans left trapped in Southeast Asia. A flurry of recent photographs and renewed charges by family members that the Defense Intelligence Agency was covering up evidence on missing servicemen have forced the Administration into a defensive and sometimes awkward position.  ""There are not games being played,"" Mr. Scowcroft said at a White House briefing mostly devoted to the Moscow summit next week. ""There is no incentive on the part of the United States to conceal anything on this tragic issue.""  A surge of attention accompanied last week's disclosure of a blurry photograph of three stocky mustached American fliers standing in a woody setting. The release of the photograph added impetus to a growing movement in Congress to force the Pentagon to unclassify thousands of secret documents related to reports or rumors about American men still living in Southeast Asia.  Defends Pentagon Handling  Mr. Scowcroft strongly defended current Pentagon handling of such documents. ""At one time in the past, the Pentagon did allow fairly wide access to the records and what happened as a result is that family members started getting letters from unscrupulous people,"" he said, suggesting that con artists were playing on the emotions of people willing to put money behind their lingering hopes.  He added that neither the Pentagon's files nor any other evidence available ""would lead one to the kinds of conclusions that a number of people have come to"" -- that Americans still live in prison camps or forced labor camps under the most horrible conditions.  The Pentagon released a study on Thursday night reporting that the much publicized photograph and letters that accompanied the picture were distributed by people in Southeast Asia known to have faked such information in the past.  The report said, ""One principal source of the photograph lies in a ring of Cambodian opportunists led by a well-known and admitted fabricator of P.O.W.-M.I.A. information."" It added that a letter allegedly written by one of the fliers ""bears little resemblance to anything that would have been written by an American officer possessing an intimate knowledge of the English language. Correct grammar, syntax, spelling, for example, are lacking.""  But family members of the three fliers say they remain convinced that their loved ones -- Col. John Leighton Robertson of the Air Force, Maj. Albro Lynn Lundy Jr. of the Air Force and Lieut. Larry James Stevens of the Navy -- are held captive in a prison camp somewhere in Vietnam.  Daughter Presses Action  They sharply criticized the report, and questioned why it was released as a senior State Department official was dispatched to Hanoi to press Vietnamese officials to investigate the origins of the photograph and the possibility that the men could still be alive.  ""Why is so much effort going into discrediting the sources behind the photograph rather than negotiating for the men in the photo?"" asked Shelby Robertson Quast, daughter of Colonel Robertson, who was lost when his F-4C Phantom crashed in North Vietnam in 1966. Suggesting that the Defense Intelligence Agency was purposely undercutting the envoy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth Quinn, she asked, ""Why is the Government so divided on this?""  There are 2,273 American servicemen still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. The Pentagon considers 1,172 as missing and 1,101 as killed in action, but their bodies have not been recovered.  Administration officials say there may be Americans who still live in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodian who married local women or who deserted, but they tend to believe the Governments of those countries who say they do not hold any prisoners.  Second Photo Is Reported  Retired Gen. John W. Vessey, President Bush's envoy to Hanoi on the issue, has made a series of trips to Vietnam to gather information. He has persuaded the Vietnamese to allow the Administration to open an office in Hanoi, and during talks earlier this year the Vietnamese agreed to allow Government investigators to travel wherever they wished. But the charges of conspiracy have persisted as no American has been found alive.  Even as Mr. Scowcroft made his remarks, another family came forward at a news conference with a new photograph that they said showed that Capt. Donald Carr of the Army, who was lost while flying on a reconnaissance mission over Laos in 1971, was still alive. Mr. Carr's family said they were given the photograph by Jack Bailey, a retired Air Force pilot who has been stalking M.I.A. cases for years.  ""My brother is alive,"" Matthew Carr, a school administrator in East Chicago, Ind., told The Associated Press.  The photograph shows a smiling man in a green sports shirt. Mr. Bailey took the photograph to Michael Charney, a forensic anthropologist at Colorado State University, to compare the picture to a snapshot of Mr. Carr at his wedding in 1961.  In a telephone interview, Mr. Charney said he could not be sure that the new photograph was authentic, but by studying the bone structures in the two pictures he could tell that ""the faces are the same.""  ""Bailey has to raise money to keep his operation going,"" he added, ""but I think he is honest.""  LOAD-DATE: July 27, 1991  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 26 1991 ,11
"    ANGELES, July 27   Last year, 17 years after her husband, an Air Force pilot, disappeared without a trace over Hanoi, Barbara Cleary O'Connor received from Vietnam a rubbing of his dog tag, complete with his serial number and blood type.  ""It was a shock,"" said Mrs. O'Connor, who lives in Wayland, Mass. ""It meant there was some information about him. I truly thought he had not survived. I never would have remarried if I had thought there was the slightest glimmer of hope.""  Nothing further came of that brief glimmer. But now again, as a photograph that is said to show three other missing American servicemen in Vietnam is drawing public attention, Mrs. O'Connor said, ""You can't help but think: 'Oh, my gosh. What if?' ""  Old Wounds Reopened      For the parents, wives, siblings and children of the 2,273 American servicemen still unaccounted for in the Vietnam War, every new report of a sighting, every new promise by the Government in Hanoi, every new delivery of boxes of bone fragments -- some of them human, some animal -- stirs old pains and fresh disappointments.  These feelings are also kept alive by cottage industries in both the United States and Southeast Asia that collect or manufacture photographs, packets of remains and reports of sightings of servicemen missing in action.  The most recent center of attention is the photograph of three middle-aged men who appear to be holding a placard with a date and cryptic lettering. Three families have come forward to assert that these men are their missing relatives. But the Pentagon says that while analysis of the photograph was inconclusive the biographical data that accompanied it were false and that the picture itself had passed through the hands of known fakers.  On Friday, Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, said there was no credible evidence that Vietnam still held any American servicemen.  This weekend a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Kenneth Quinn, is meeting with officials in Vietnam and Laos to seek information about missing fliers; the State Department would not give any other information about his mission.  The source of the photograph is uncertain, but it apparently passed through the hands of one of several American groups that have played on the emotions of missing servicemen's families with urgent fund-raising appeals.  ""If I cannot raise $13,671.71 by October 31,"" reads an appeal, this one in 1986 by Operation Rescue, a group headed by a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, Jack Bailey, ""vital intelligence gathering cannot continue. And an American serviceman will die in the jungles of Vietnam.""  Another appeal, by the Skyhook II Project, says: ""We're close to making contact with an American P.O.W. who has been alone since his fellow prisoner died of natural causes less than a year ago. That effort could fail for lack of funds. Please be as generous as you can."" The head of that project is John LeBoutillier, a Republican Congressman from Long Island from 1981 to 1983.  Both appeals were quoted, among many others, in a 1987 analysis by the Federal Defense Intelligence Agency, which concluded, ""For all their 'proof' and the untold millions of dollars raised, none of these groups or individuals have yet to furnish even the slightest shred of evidence of P.W.'s, much less secure the return of a living American captive.""  Seeking the Mafia's Help      Victimized by groups like these, Maureen Dunn of Randolph, Mass., said she was once persuaded to travel to New York for a fruitless meeting with members of the Mafia in search of information about her husband, a Navy pilot who was shot down in 1968. There is no evidence the Mafia has been extensively involved in schemes involving missing servicemen.  Another time, Mrs. Dunn said, she traveled in great secrecy to Canada, where she waited in vain in the back pew of an empty church for a promised meeting with a man who had said he had information for her.  Now, as an active member of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, she said, ""I must receive 5 to 10 dog-tag stories a week. It's a cottage industry, let me tell you, and it's a terrible emotional roller coaster for the families.""  The league, a lobbying group, works with the American Government to seek the return of any remaining live prisoners or their remains and to obtain a full accounting of the missing.  Hopes continue to be fueled by the sheer number of Americans believed to have been captured, by continuing reports of live sightings and by the fact that the Vietnamese Government has concealed evidence of missing Americans.  For Mrs. O'Connor, the unsettling stirring of hope came when a Vietnamese refugee presented the rubbing of her husband's dog tag to American officials with the notion of trading it for resettlement in the United States. Since then, she said, half a dozen other refugees have come forward with similar rubbings, but with no evidence that her husband, Major Peter Cleary, is alive.  One of the most colorful rescue schemes was launched in 1983 by James (Bo) Gritz, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who led a band of mercenaries into Laos, where they were promptly ambushed and fled.  George Brooks of New Windsor, N.Y., the father of a missing Navy pilot, remembers that mission well. He said he contributed about $30,000, including his son's insurance money, to Mr. Gritz, whom he called ""a very persuasive speaker.""  In part, he said, he acted out of a frustration that is shared by many families with what they see as the Government's slow pace, political swings and occasional confusion or misinformation in individual cases.  Kate Rothacker of Mission Viejo, Calif., said that perhaps because her brother had been shot down during a secret mission for the Air Force the Government told her family that he was dead. The family later discovered that Pentagon records showed a clear possibility that he had parachuted to safety.  A Political Tool>      ""It's real hard to describe the low that you feel at the deception that they pulled,"" Ms. Rothacker said.  At one point President Richard M. Nixon tried to use the families of missing servicemen as a political counterweight to antiwar protests. For example, he invited them to the White House, where they were serenaded with ""The Impossible Dream"" and praised for their patriotism.  President Jimmy Carter, emphasizing normalization of relations with Vietnam, declared the missing-in-action cases closed and transferred all but one symbolic name to the status of killed in action.  Since President Ronald Reagan took office, the Government has taken a more active approach to the issue, and more than 100 Government officials are now assigned to the search for answers. But the Government has had to deal with shifts of policy on the Vietnamese side, which has parceled out remains over the years as one of its few bargaining tools in the slow movement toward re-establishing diplomatic relations.  The last live American to emerge from captivity in Vietnam since the release of American prisoners in 1973 was Robert Garwood, a Marine private who had deserted and who asked to return home in 1979, four years after the end of the war.  He was court-martialed, convicted for collaborating with the enemy and for assaulting another American prisoner, and received a dishonorable discharge.  Since the war ended in 1975, the Pentagon has received 1,483 firsthand reports of live sightings of possible Americans in Indochina, said Comdr. Edward Lundquist, a spokesman for the Defense Department. Only about a quarter of these have been determined to be fakes; 1,008 have been definitely identified as Americans, including missionaries and jailed civilians but not any of the missing servicemen. Three hundred of the sightings were of Private Garwood.  Tired of Waiting      As of now, 103 first-hand reports of sightings remain unresolved, Comander Lundquist said, including 45 involving an American in captivity and 58 involving an American said to be living freely somewhere in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia.  Two of the live sighting reports, in 1984 and 1986, seemed to involve Clarence N. Driver, a retired Air Force major who was flying for Air America when he was shot down over Laos on March 7, 1973. But his wife, Allene, who is now 66 years old and has never remarried, has grown tired of hoping.  ""I feel that unless they are going to do something about it, I'd rather they don't tell us anything any more,"" she said. ""It gets your hopes up and then nothing happens.""  But as in a growing number of families, the younger generation is beginning now to take over the struggle because, as Mrs. Driver's 34-year-old daughter, Sharon, said, ""We realize that our moms are tired and it's our turn to try to keep that spark alive.""  Miss Driver said news coverage of the recent air war in the Persian Gulf revived their memories and sharpened their feelings of loss.  ""Every time a plane was shot down, wow, it just brought back memories of the day when I was 16 and my father's plane was shot down,"" she said. ""It's like this. Just pretend you're talking to someone you love very much on the telephone and that person says, 'Hold on a second; I'll be right back,' and they never come back.""

"      As a result of improving American-Vietnamese relations, the Defense Department said today that it was sharply increasing the number of people assigned to investigate the cases of servicemen unaccounted for in the Vietnam War.  Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said an expected increase in access to crash sites in Vietnam and to Hanoi's wartime archives had prompted the military to increase the number of investigators, analysts and other workers to 222 from 134.  ""It's a very painstaking process to go through all these records,"" Mr. Williams told reporters today. ""Now we can begin to sit down and go through that material very, very carefully, and that is going to produce finds for us which we can then analyze.""  Today's announcement comes amid a flurry of publicity over photographs supposedly showing American servicemen in Southeast Asia, and growing calls in Congress for the Administration to redouble its efforts to examine the issue.  Dole Urges Commission  Senator Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican who is the Senate minority leader, urged President Bush on Sunday to create a special presidential commission to determine whether any American servicemen are still being held in Southeast Asia.  But at a special White House briefing Friday, the President's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said ""there is still no credible evidence"" to suggest that American servicemen are being held captive in Laos, Cambodia or Vietnam.  Of the 2,273 servicemen still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, the Pentagon classifies 1,172 as missing. The other 1,101 are believed to have been killed in action, but their bodies have not been recovered.  Mr. Williams said the increase in experts dealing with missing servicemen had been ""in the mill"" for several months, and did not stem from the resurgent public interest in the issue.  The additional personnel will include interviewers, linguists, anthropologists, dental experts, intelligence analysts, graves registration specialists and clerks assigned to offices in Washington, Hawaii and Thailand.  Meeting With Cheney  The Pentagon also set up a special field office in Hanoi three weeks ago, which initially was assigned two investigators.  Mr. Dole praised the Pentagon plan as ""another opportunity to pursue every lead"" shortly after he and nine other Republican senators met with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in Mr. Dole's office today to discuss the issue.  The beefed-up investigation and broader access to Vietnamese records are likely to raise the hopes of family members who cling to hopes that their loved ones are alive.  ""It all depends on the kind of access the Vietnamese are willing to give,"" said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the American League of P.O.W./M.I.A. Families in Washington. ""It could mean a tremendous increase in results, which would give answers to many questions that exist for families.""

"    Even during the peak of America's influence in Vietnam two decades ago, many G.I.'s felt there was something otherworldly about the place. Since then, Vietnam's mysteries have deepened. Cumbersome Treasury regulations imposed after the war strongly discourage U.S. citizens from traveling to Vietnam and Cambodia. Hanoi's own bureaucratic rules have multiplied the obstacles.  That double paper curtain has worked to the advantage of unscrupulous con artists who prey on the emotional vulnerability of families of servicemen missing in action. In the absence of real information, it is all too easy to persuade M.I.A. families and friends that many middle-aged American slave laborers populate Indochina's jungles, villages and cities.  Pentagon investigators, who do have access to Vietnam and Cambodia, insist that almost all reported M.I.A. sightings turn out to be erroneous or fraudulent. Many Americans, however, are reluctant to take the word of faceless officials. A better response would be to reduce the obstacles to travel, giving ordinary Americans a chance to look around for themselves.  Last summer, I got some idea of what that might be like, visiting Vietnam on assignment. I spent most of my time in major cities and none of it trying to track down M.I.A. reports. If Americans were being held in rural villages or jungle prison camps, I wouldn't have run into them.  But my trip did have the salutary effect of demystifying Vietnam. And it suggested, further, that allowing Americans to visit Vietnam freely might do much to demystify the M.I.A. issue.  I saw an ideological police state, but the repression was not so tight as to smother unsolicited expressions of popular discontent. A sizable proportion of Vietnamese adults speak some English, and many have regular contact with relatives who now live in the U.S. If there were any number of living M.I.A.'s, it would be hard for Vietnamese authorities to prevent some detailed and verifiable information reaching Pentagon investigators -- or the ears of ordinary tourists.  I also found that even hard-line Communist authorities, aware of their country's catastrophic economic failures, were eager for outside investment. Vietnam may still be isolated from the United States but it is not isolated from the larger capitalist world. In addition to growing numbers of Western business people, Vietnam hosts a well-informed and inquisitive diplomatic community, including Australians, Japanese and Swedes. This international presence would surely complicate any hope of keeping large and explosive secrets.  The best reassurance, however, would come from changes permitting a sharp rise in the number of American travelers to Vietnam.  Hanoi has recently started doing its part, upgrading its hotels and simplifying paperwork. Washington still resists. The Bush Administration's policy is that normal diplomatic relations -- including freedom of travel -- cannot begin until there is government-to-government progress on resolving the M.I.A. issue, as well as Vietnamese cooperation in international peace efforts concerning Cambodia.  On the M.I.A. question, that seems to be putting things exactly backward. If there are in fact significant numbers of living M.I.A.'s in Indochina, encouraging American travel would greatly improve the odds of finding them.

"   , Thailand, Aug. 23   The leaders of Vietnam and Cambodia have renewed pledges of an ""open inquiry"" to resolve rapidly the fates of Americans listed as missing in action in those Southeast Asian nations, Senator John Kerry said today.  After a weeklong visit to Vietnam and Cambodia, Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the two Communist countries had promised to allow United States helicopters to take part in the search. They also pledged to welcome Americans making their own inquiries and to give unprecedented access to a newly formed Senate committee investigating the possibility that some of the missing Americans are still alive, he said.  ""I think it is very significant that they are willing to have that kind of intrusion, that kind of open inquiry,"" Mr. Kerry told a news conference. ""It seems to me at first blush that they are extraordinarily committed to make that happen.""  Met With Many Officials  During his trip to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and Phnom Penh in Cambodia, Mr. Kerry met with Do Muoi, head of Vietnam's Communist Party, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia and a number of other officials in both countries.  Mr. Kerry's comments echoed those of United States officials who say that Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos have significantly stepped up cooperation on the issue of 2,273 Americans listed as missing in Southeast Asia.  Vietnam is eager for diplomatic relations with Washington and the lifting of a United States trade embargo hampering recovery of that country's ruinous economy.  Mr. Kerry, a highly decorated Vietnam War veteran, said he made the trip to lay the groundwork for an effort by the 12-member Senate committee he heads. Mr. Kerry said he also planned to visit Laos.  Did Some Stay Behind?  Mr. Kerry indicated that he thought a small number of Americans may have stayed behind in Vietnam of their own free will, but he declined to give details.  ""It is very difficult to comprehend the rationale for a government to formally be holding somebody, and I saw nothing while I was there to change my mind about creating a rationale,"" he said when asked about possible American prisoners of war in Indochina.  Mr. Kerry said Vietnamese leaders agreed to allow a small United States team, based in Hanoi, which is searching for missing Americans to have more logistical support, including helicopters. He said three to four American helicopters may be sent to Vietnam to assist the search, with the Vietnamese doing the flying.  He said this would allow quicker movement to areas where ""live sightings"" of Americans are reported.  LOAD-DATE: August 24, 1991  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 23 1991 ,11
"      At a time when American competitiveness, or lack of it, in Asia is much debated, corporations and business organizations in the United States are pressing for an end to the trade and investment boycott of Vietnam, a country where American companies say they believe they could do very well.  The quiet lobbying -- led by the petroleum, construction, telecommunications and consulting industries -- is prompted by the perception that the Japanese have been positioning themselves in Vietnam for decades and will grab many of the contracts when Vietnam becomes integrated in world trade.  Japan and South Korea, apparently uncomfortable with an American-led embargo, have begun moving in recent weeks toward greater participation in the Vietnamese economy.  American products, introduced in South Vietnam in the 1960's and 1970's, are highly prized by Hanoi -- and still functioning. An official of Caterpillar Far East Commercial Ltd., the Asian subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc., based in Peoria, Ill., told a Congressional committee recently that on a visit to Vietnam last spring he saw working Caterpillar vehicles that had been delivered 20 years ago.  ""The interest in Vietnam is substantial,"" said Virginia Foote, director of the three-year-old United States Vietnam Trade Council, a private group that helps American companies and individuals position themselves for the competition expected in the Vietnmese economy when the embargo is finally lifted. The council's chairman is William H. Sullivan, a former United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Vietnam, whom Hanoi approached for help in 1988.  Ms. Foote said at least 10 large corporations and about 300 smaller companies, plus dozens of individual entrepreneurs, had joined the council, which gives briefings every couple of months in Washington to keep Americans abreast of trade laws as well as developments in Vietnam. The council is asking the Treasury Department for a license to bring Vietnamese to the United States under fellowships, or to allow Americans to teach courses in Vietnamese schools or companies.  Nearly 17 years after the end of the Vietnam War, the United States not only maintains a nearly total embargo against country-to-country dealings with Vietnam but also opposes any assistance to Hanoi by international lending and development organizations, in particular the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund, where Vietnam is in arrears from past borrowing.  Washington does not, however, object to the World Bank's conducting surveys or giving advice in Vietnam in preparation for later development. On Dec. 17, the State Department relaxed travel restrictions, allowing group tours to Vietnam to be sold in the United States. Moreover, about $1 million in humanitarian assistance goes to Vietnam annually through private organizations, and an unknown amount of financial help is provided Vietnamese families by relatives in the West.  But all applications for commercial trading licenses are routinely rejected, Government officials say. Americans, unlike their competitors in Japan and Europe, are not permitted to open offices in Vietnam. In Asia, American Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong, Bangkok and other cities have begun campaigns to lobby Congress and the Administration for a change in this restrictive policy.  Hanoi Seeking Oil Bids  Hanoi, short of hard currency and suffering from the loss of Soviet aid, is urgently seeking bids to explore and develop its oilfields in the South China Sea and to begin constructing or reconstructing roads, power plants, airports, ports and industrial buildings. Vietnam needs aircraft and wants to sell textiles and agriculture products, including tropical fruit and processed seafood.  Jerry Smith, a spokesman for Phillips Petroleum in Bartlesville, Okla., acknowledged that Phillips was among the oil companies interested in exploring Vietnamese offshore fields ""as soon as the embargo comes off.""  David Dollar, the World Bank's Vietnam specialist, said the rebuilding of Vietnam, extremely impoverished by half a century of wars, is likely to cost roughly $500 million a year for five years. Mr. Dollar, speaking at the Asia Society last month, said it was far from clear where Vietnam would secure the money for these contracts.  Low Incomes, High Debt  The country has nearly 70 million people and one of the lowest per-capita incomes in the world -- barely $200 a year -- and is $140 million in arrears to the International Monetary Fund. Hanoi is also thought to have large foreign debts in rubles to the former Soviet Union and in hard currencies to commercial lenders in Japan. Hanoi and Tokyo are now negotiating a debt-repayment plan.  At the Commerce Department, several officials said that Americans's interest in trading or investing in Vietnam is significant, despite the uncertainties. Among those asking for help and information are war veterans who would like to go back and help the country rebuild.  Change Not Expected Soon  State Department officials who deal with Vietnam say they are aware of the concerns of American business, and they acknowledge that Vietnam, with a well-educated labor force eager for jobs, holds a lot of potential. But the general feeling in the Bush Administration, in Congress and in private research organizations is that lifting the embargo and granting diplomatic recognition to Vietnam are not likely to occur before this year's Presidential election.  Under the terms of a ""road map"" the American Government presented to the Vietnamese last spring, Hanoi must help smooth the transition to democracy in neighboring Cambodia and demonstrate that it is doing all it can to resolve at least 82 possibly solvable cases involving the 2,267 Americans who are missing in Indochina or whose remains have not been found.  In the State Department, even officials most predisposed to hastening the recognition of Vietnam say that Hanoi is not extending as much cooperation as it could, perhaps because Communist hard-liners continue to deal from a position of mistrust and suspicion in issues involving Americans.

"      The Government of Vietnam has confirmed that it allowed at least one American prisoner of war to be questioned by the K.G.B.  In a radio announcement in Hanoi on Monday and a statement today by Vietnam's United Nations Mission in New York, the Vietnamese said the interrogation took place in January 1973.  The Vietnamese announcement that an American prisoner was interrogated shortly before prisoners were returned to the United States as part of the cease-fire agreement was meant, in effect, to rebut the assertions made by a former K.G.B. official who has said Americans were still being held by Vietnam as late as 1978 and were interrogated by the K.G.B.  The official, Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin, who says he was head of the K.G.B.'s counterintelligence operations, testified today before the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs. In his testimony, General Kalugin repeated his assertions that the K.G.B. interviewed several Americans in Vietnam as late as 1975-78, after the war had ended and all American prisoners were reported released.  Recruiting Soviet Spies  General Kalugin, in more than three hours of testimony that was often vague on detail, told the committee that the K.G.B.'s intent in meeting a few of ""a handful"" of Americans held by Vietnam after the war was not primarily to gather intelligence but to recruit spies for the Soviet Union from among the prisoners. On the whole, the effort was a failure, he said.  He also said that the Soviet Army intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U., its initials in Russian, was more interested than the K.G.B in gathering technical information from American prisoners about advanced equipment and procedures. Americans in Hanoi's possession might have been subject to G.R.U. interrogation, General Kalugin said.  Vietnam's admission that it had turned over an American to Soviet interrogators in 1973 came after an investigation requested by the United States M.I.A.-P.O.W. liaison office in Hanoi, which was established last year.  The Bush Administration and the Select Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, have also been pressing the Russian Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin for information on reports that some Americans might have been taken to the Soviet Union.  The Vietnamese statement indentified the prisoner interrogated in 1973 as Eugene Andre Weaver, whom the Vietnamese say they captured on Jan. 31, 1968, in the central Vietnamese city of Hue. At that time, Hue was the center of some of the fiercest fighting of the 1968 Tet offensive.  Mr. Weaver might have been a C.I.A. agent that Hanoi had sought unsuccessfully to exchange for one of its top intelligence chiefs held by the South Vietnamese in 1972, people in the American intelligence community said.  Interrogation of Americans  The Vietnamese say that the Soviet Union wanted to meet Mr. Weaver because he was ""of Soviet origin."" Hanoi says that after the first meeting, Mr. Weaver declined to see Soviet officials a second time, and that no other Americans were subsequently turned over.  The Vietnamese say that the Soviet interrogator in the Weaver case was Oleg Nechiporenko, an agent working for General Kalugin. Mr. Nechiporenko said earlier that he had interviewed an American in January 1973. But he has challenged General Kalugin's assertions that Americans were interrogated after that.  The United States and Vietnam signed a peace accord in January 1973. Vietnam has always insisted that all American prisoners were returned to the United States in March and April of that year.  Today, Vietnam seemed to be owning up to the interview reported by Mr. Nechiporenko. It continues to brand General Kalugin's accusations that Americans were interviewed as late as 1978 ""fabrications with ill purpose.""  Mr. Kalugin said that efforts to discredit him in Vietnam and from within the K.G.B. derive from a desire among the remnants of the Soviet intelligence system to protect Vietnam as Moscow's ""last listening post in the Far East,"" following the loss of cooperative arrangements with the former Communist regimes of Eastern Europe. He said that it did not suprise him that Vietnam and hard-liners in the K.G.B. would synchronize their stories.  Seized C.I.A. Agents  The details revealed by Hanoi about Mr. Weaver's case match those of a Central Intelligence Agency description of one of two agents it admitted on Jan. 3 were picked up in Vietnam and might have been questioned by Russians. The C.I.A. did not name the men. But it said one had been captured in 1968 and released in 1973, after being interrogated in Hanoi ""by an individual who may have been a Soviet intelligence officer.""  In that statement, moreover, the C.I.A. acknowledged that a second C.I.A. officer had been seized in South Vietnam in April 1975, the month in which Hanoi's army captured Saigon. The second agent, also not named, was released the following October. The C.I.A. says that ""Soviet officials may have been supporting"" his interrogation, ""but none were directly involved."" This case could lend credence to General Kalugin's assertions.  Today a spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment on whether Mr. Weaver was one of its agents, saying that longstanding policy dictates that the agency not confirm or deny the idenity of an employee.  As the Select Committee proceeds with its investigations and hearings, it is becoming evident that the P.O.W.-M.I.A. debate revolves around two sets of Americans connected to the war.  On one hand, there are the publicly acknowledged cases of 2,267 servicemen still listed as missing, or who are known to have died but whose bodies have not been found. On the other hand, there are an unknown number of more shadowy American figures, among them C.I.A. agents and people connected to the agency's airline, Air America. There are also servicemen who were on secret missions after the 1973 withdrawal of American forces.   LOAD-DATE: January 22, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo: Gen. Oleg D.

"      The Bush Administration has given several former Soviet republics the names of more than 50 Americans listed as missing in action from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars who might have been moved to the Soviet Union, officials said today.  The names include those of Americans who fought in Asia in World War II, crew members aboard warplanes that were downed near Soviet territory in the Korean War and prisoners of war taken in Vietnam, the officials said.  The Defense Department has assembled about 50 names of Americans listed as missing in action from World War II to before the Vietnam War, officials said. In addition, the State Department has discussed with the former Soviet republics the cases of several Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War, said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity and would not release the list.  A spokesman for the State Department said leaders of Kazakhstan promised Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d last month that United States officials would be allowed to visit Sary-Shagan, 150 miles northwest of Alma-Ata, the Kazakh capital, to investigate a report that American prisoners had been taken there from Vietnam.  Pursuing Reports  ""We continue to work with Russian officials and officials of other republics where it's appropriate to pursue any reports that we get, even ones that we don't have real substantiation for,"" said the spokesman, Richard A. Boucher. He did not specify which other republics had been notified.  State Department officials are also preparing to meet next week with Oleg D. Kalugin, a former major general with the K.G.B. who says that at least three Americans, two in the military and one from the Central Intelligence Agency, were interrogated by Soviet intelligence officers in Vietnam in 1978.  In taking the unusual step of disputing Mr. Kalugin's contention, the agency said two of its agents had been interrogated in Vietnam, but that one had been released in 1973 and the other in 1975, when the Saigon Government fell to the Communists and the country was unified.  The agency's reaction joined a growing body of official United States skepticism to Mr. Kalugin's assertions that the Soviet Union had interrogated American prisoners five years after the United States quit the Vietnam War in 1973. Vietnam says it returned all American prisoners of war soon after a peace agreement was signed in 1973.  Agent Released in 1973  The agency said one of its operatives was captured in South Vietnam in 1968, questioned at several locations in the south and then moved to North Vietnam. He remained in captivity in the northern capital, Hanoi, until he was released with other American prisoners of war in 1973, the agency said.  ""In at least one instance, the C.I.A. officer was questioned in Hanoi by an individual who may have been a Soviet intelligence officer,"" the agency said.  Mr. Kalugin has identified the officer in charge of the interrogations as Oleg Nechiporenko, who he has said was working in the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City. Mr. Boucher said Mr. Kalugin had been cooperating with United States officials to try to find Mr. Nechiporenko and set up a meeting with him.  A second intelligence officer was captured in South Vietnam in April 1975, the agency said, taken to Hanoi and released in October of that year. During this man's questioning by the Vietnamese, ""there were some indications that Soviet officials may have been supporting the interrogation, but none were directly involved,"" the agency said in a statement.  A spokesman for the Defense Department, Bob Hall, said in December that interviews with American prisoners who returned after the Vietnam War had turned up no evidence of interrogation by Soviet agents.

"      This year, for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War, Washington will be offering scholarships for Vietnamese to study in the United States under the 46-year-old Fulbright fellowship program.  Fifteen scholarships have been set aside for 1992 and another 15 for 1993 as part of the legislation that provides money for running the State Department and the United States Information Agency. The agency, which has been allocated $300,000 for the program, is now beginning the process of recruiting competitors for the awards in a country with which Washington does not have diplomatic relations.  Addie O'Connell, chief of academic exchange programs for the agency, said that U.S.I.A. is about to begin discussions with the New York-based Institute for International Education on how to locate and evaluate potential fellows, since American testing programs are not available in Vietnam. Ms. O'Connell said the agency hoped to have at least of few of the first Vietnamese Fulbright scholars in American universities by the fall.  The Fulbright scholarship program, conceived and sponsored by Senator J. W. Fulbright of Arkansas, came into being in 1946 as a means of using the sale of war materiel to aquaint Americans with overseas cultures. The new program is specifically limited to Vietnamese residents in Vietnam, and will not be open to exiles.  Discussing Embargo  Under the legislation passed by Congress in October, it was decided that preference would be given to Vietnamese ""intending to pursue studies in economics and commercial law.""  Vietnam and the United States are still discussing steps to be taken by Hanoi before Washington will lift a trade and investment embargo, 17 years after the end of the war. This week, the Pentagon's new Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, Alan Ptak, is to meet Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi to talk about resolving the cases of Americans still unaccounted for.  He will be accompanied by John Vessey, the retired army general who is a special Presidential envoy to Vietnam, and Brig. Gen. Thomas Needham, the head of a newly expanded office set up to coordinate all P.O.W.-M.I.A. efforts.  On Wednesday, a meeting will take place in Washington between Trinh Xuan Lang, Hanoi's representative at the United Nations, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth Quinn, who heads the American team in continuing talks with the Vietnamese on normalizing relations between the two countries.  Ways of Training Sought  Hanoi has been looking for ways to train economists, business managers and international lawyers in the West. American law firms are eager to establish branches in Vietnam and have offered to assist the private United States-Vietnam Trade Council in setting up legal training. The council hopes to set up its own legal exchange.  The Fulbright program had been available to scholars in what was formerly South Vietnam before the collapse of the country in 1975.  Students from unified Vietnam have been granted visas in increasing numbers for individual programs in the United States over the last five years, according to John McAuliff, director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a private organization that has been helping Vietnamese scholars come to this country and Americans go to Vietnam.  ""These exchanges were done fairly quietly at first because there was a fear that the overseas Vietnamese community would harass people from Vietnam,"" Mr. McAuliff said. ""But that seems to be a thing of the past. The numbers of students coming increased dramatically in 1991.""  The Vietnamese Fulbright scholarship program originated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, under the sponsorship of Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. Senator Kerry, a Vietnam veteran, is also chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.  LOAD-DATE: January 29, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 4 1992 ,11
"   , Thailand, March 5   The United States pledged today to expand its humanitarian aid to Vietnam in exchange for additional cooperation from Hanoi in resolving the fate of Americans missing from the Vietnam War.  At the same time, the United States said it was still not prepared to lift a 17-year-old trade embargo that has crippled the Vietnamese economy and angered American investors wanting to do business there.  The aid package was announced in Hanoi by Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, the highest-ranking American diplomat to visit Vietnam in six years. Other diplomats said the aid package would provide Vietnam with at least $3 million a year in American assistance.  Mr. Solomon's trip to Vietnam came amid speculation, both in Washington and Hanoi, that the Bush Administration would restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam shortly after the Presidential election.  Cambodia Elections Cited  According to a dispatch from Reuters in Hanoi, Mr. Solomon ended that speculation, saying at a news conference today that the Administration did not envision full diplomatic relations with Vietnam until the spring of 1993, when free elections are expected in neighboring Cambodia.  The United States is trying to keep Vietnam from meddling in the elections or in other elements of the United Nations-brokered peace process in Cambodia.  Mr. Solomon's Vietnamese counterpart in this week's talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, was quoted as saying at the same Hanoi news conference that while the talks had been constructive, the trade embargo was a ""hostile policy"" against Vietnam. ""We think the trade embargo is an abnormal thing in relations between nations,"" he said.  Diplomats said that under today's agreement, American aid would be channeled to educational and medical programs in Vietnam.  In return, they said, the Vietnamese Government has agreed to allow American investigators to travel on short notice to areas of Vietnam where there are reported sightings of missing Americans. Hanoi said today that it would also allow Defense Department investigators greater access to Vietnamese military archives, long a sticking point between the two nations.

"      The Bush Administration is under growing pressure from American business leaders and foreign allies to modify its embargo against Vietnam.  In response, officials say, the Government may be preparing to move to a new phase of relations with Hanoi, which recently pledged to remove some major obstacles to the resolution of the issue of Americans still missing from the Vietnam War.  The sense that an American policy move is imminent is provoking protest from some veterans organizations and groups lobbying for families of the missing. In a letter to President Bush on March 27, the national commander of the American Legion, Dominic D. DiFrancesco, voiced ""extreme concern"" that the embargo might be lifted.  Pressure for Change  Among the organizations calling for a policy change is the President's Export Council, a group from private business, Congress and several government departments, which advises the White House on international trade. In a letter to President Bush on March 4, the chairman of the council, Heinz C. Prechter, wrote: ""It is the Council's belief that the United States will lose substantial competitive ground in Southeast Asia in the immediate future if we do not begin some relaxation of the embargo on Vietnam.""  Mr. Prechter, chairman and chief executive officer of ASC Inc., a supplier of auto accessories who accompanied President Bush to Asia, was among about 250 people to give $100,000 or more to the Republican Party in 1988, according to the party.  His appearance among those arguing for relaxation of the embargo indicates that the topic is not strictly political, with Democrats urging improved relations and Republicans using the issue of the missing to continue isolating Hanoi.  ""'We cannot watch from the tailgate as other nations get their fair share of trade in Vietnam, a big nation of 66 million people that needs to buy many things,"" Mr. Prechter said. ""I think this is very important to America, just as the whole Pacific-Asia arena is.""  Richard Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, who returned recently from Indochina, was apparently promised a higher level of cooperation from Hanoi on the issue of the missing. The French have told the President they will not hold off indefinitely in pressing for reintegration of Vietnam into the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.  Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, a private organization based here, said Hanoi had agreed to take five new steps.  The decision came after what some Vietnamese officials described as a ""brawl"" in Hanoi between Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry officials, with the latter holding out against concessions to the United States, Ms. Foote said.  The steps are: allowing immediate access to the Vietnamese countryside for checking reports of sightings of live prisoners; providing increased access to military archives; agreeing to a 24-month schedule of excavations by American-Vietnamese teams; accepting the need for meetings with Laos and Cambodia to coordinate searches for Americans; and promising to turn over any remains found whenever they are produced.  Vietnam also said that remaining political prisoners from the war years would be freed.  Election-Year Skepticism  According to a ""road map"" charting milestones that must be passed before the embargo can be lifted and diplomatic recognition extended to Hanoi, the two sides could now be entering the second phase of a four-phase process. In this phase, the United States would allow American companies to bid on and negotiate, but not sign, contracts.  The Export Council letter also urges that the Administration eliminate currency restrictions and lift the ban on the use of credit cards for American business travel in Vietnam.  Some people who follow American policy toward the region are skeptical of reports that the Administration or Congress can be pushed by business pressure alone into a significant move on Vietnam in an election year.  Evelyn Colbert, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific from 1978 to 1980, said today that before Vietnam invaded Cambodia and set back its chances of American recognition, there was no great urgency in Indochina policy.

"      Expectations that the United States and Vietnam would soon establish diplomatic relations, more than 15 years after the end of the Indochina War, may be set back by a resurgence of interest in one piece of unfinished business that will not go away: the fate of missing Americans.  The revival of the issue has been spurred by a series of statements over the last six months -- from apparently bogus reports of sightings of live Americans to unsubstantiated information that Soviet officials interrogated Americans in Indochina after the time Vietnam said it had freed them.  While most American officials discount such reports, their persistence has led to the establishment of a committee in Congress that will begin to draw together new threads of the story in hearings over the next few weeks.  This week, State Department officials are expected to meet with Maj. Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin, the former Soviet intelligence official who reported the interrogations in October. The former K.G.B. official, who has been interviewed in Moscow by American Embassy officials, is expected to testify at a closed session of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.  To Interview Former Agents  The panel will begin this week to interview former intelligence agents or servicemen who had access to secret information in the 1960's and 1970's and who have reportedly offered to testify that more was known about the fate of missing Americans than subsequent Administrations acknowledged.  Some members of Congress predict that the panel's findings will move the American-Vietnam relationship into domestic politics.  Representative Robert G. Toricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, said he would guarantee that the issue is brought up in this Presidential election year.  ""The steady accumulation of information and persistent expressions of doubts about the fate of missing Americans has now shifted the burden of proof to the Vietnamese,"" said Mr. Toricelli, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who first discussed the issue with officials in Hanoi in 1984. ""If George Bush persists in moving toward recognition now, he is putting himself at considerable political risk. I wouldn't have said that six months ago.""  In October, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the United States was prepared to begin talks with Hanoi to establish relations.  He said progress would depend on Vietnam's willingness to furnish information about 2,273 Americans who are listed in records as prisoners of war or missing in action.  On Friday, the State Department reiterated that lifting economic sanctions and opening diplomatic relations depended on Hanoi's cooperation in making a fuller accounting of the missing. It also said it had supplied a list of names of missing servicemen to officials of several former Soviet republics. Richard A. Boucher, the deputy spokesman, said Kazakhstan had offered to allow United States officials to visit a high-security military installation at Sary-Shagan, 150 miles northwest of Alma-Ata, the Kazakh capital, to investigate a report that Americans had been taken there from Vietnam.  Those who believe that missing Americans are still alive say progress on accounting for has them slowed in the last year.  ""In fact, 1991 was the worst year in accounting for cases,"" said Ann Mills Griffiths, who heads the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, the largest of many advocacy groups.  Referring to the Vietnamese, she said in an interview: ""Did they in fact withhold Americans after the general release in 1973? We know there are glaring discrepancies they could resolve by giving us access to files. They could resolve these if they had the political will to do so.""  Officials say that about half the Americans unaccounted for are assumed to have been killed. Of the rest, only a few dozen, at most, may have been left behind or seized on clandestine operations after the American withdrawal in January 1973.  But doubts persist among those who, according to opinion polls, think more were left behind and that some may have survived.  Most Americans close to investigations discount stories of live sightings, saying it is inconceivable that with all the Vietnamese defectors and refugees in the West, some incontrovertible evidence would not have been produced.  Hanoi, stung by the allegations that it held American prisoners after the 1973 withdrawal and the fall of Saigon in 1975, told a visiting American Congressman on Friday that investigators should come and see for themselves that the charges are not true.  ""They flatly denied these, as expected,"" Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, said in a telephone interview from Bangkok after leaving the Vietnamese capital. ""They are still hopeful of better relations with the United States. But a lot depends on how convincing the Kalugin evidence is.""  In October, General Kalugin, who said he sent interrogation teams to Vietnam from 1975 to 1978 but did not go himself, began telling Western reporters that he knew that Americans had been turned over to his teams for questioning before being returned to Hanoi's custody.  In a telephone interview from Moscow, General Kalugin expanded on his allegations that certain unidentified Americans known to possess advanced knowledge of high technology were interrogated by his teams. The Vietnamese, he said, lacked the expertise to interrogate these prisoners. He insisted that at least three Americans he knew of had subsequently been freed by Hanoi and then traced in the United States by the K.G.B in the hope that they would be useful in the future. There are no American reports of such returnees.  On Saturday, the press agency Tass quoted a spokeswoman for foreign intelligence, Tatyana Samolis, as saying the Russian authorities had made a thorough study of K.G.B. files and found only one contact with an American prisoner, in 1973. The Central Intelligence Agency on Friday also disputed General Kalugin's assertions, saying that two of its agents had been interrogated in Vietnam, but that one was released in 1973 and the other in 1975.  Nevertheless, General Kalugin's statements have been seized on by advocacy groups who believe that the United States knew about such cases but kept silent to avoid compromising intelligence.  Representative Solarz calls these accusations ""wholesale McCarthyism.""  ""The notion that any Administration was aware that people were being held against their will and covered it up is a monstrous accusation, which if one thinks about it, has to be premised on the notion that there were traitors in key positions,"" he said. He says the story that Americans could have been slipped back into society, as General Kalugin says, is ""extremely suspect.""  The growth and influence of the advocacy groups alarm those who believe that the only way to resolve the issue is through closer relations with the Vietnamese, said John McAuliff, director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project in New York. He called the lobby for the missing ""a tiger that is now out of control.""  LOAD-DATE: January 6, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photos: Gen. Oleg D.

"      The Bush Administration today named the nation's first Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, according to a Congressional announcement. The nominee, Alan C. Ptak, is deputy staff director of a Senate Select Committee set up last year to reopen investigations into the issue of Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced the creation of the Pentagon post in September, citing new information becoming available to help resolve the fate of the 2,267 Americans still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.  For more than a year, there has been rising public pressure to re-examine the issue, on which progress must be made before the Administration will lift an economic embargo on Vietnam and move toward the establishment of diplomatic relations.  The Pentagon declined to confirm the appointment today, saying that it was awaiting White House action.  The Senate Select Committee this week began taking depositions from Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin, a former K.G.B. official who asserts that Soviet agents were interrogating American prisoners in Vietnam up to five years after Hanoi said they had all been released. The committee is also taking closed-door testimony from former American servicemen, intelligence agents and officials who assert that the United States had covered up information on missing Americans.  Bush Administration officials expect to meet General Kalugin, the former head of Soviet counterintelligence, next week in Washington. The recollections of General Kalugin, who never went to Vietnam, have been challenged by one of his interrogators, Oleg Nechiporenko, who said he remembers talking with only one American, in 1973 at the time of the Paris peace accord.  In an interview, Sen. John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Select Committee, said that his staff members met General Kalugin on Wednesday ""right off the plane"" from Moscow. The former K.G.B. officer is in the United States to promote a book on the failed August coup in Moscow published by Turner Publishing, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting.  Bush Administration officials expect to meet General Kalugin next week in Washington.  Senator Kerry said his committee would also meet Robert Garwood, a former Marine private and the last American prisoner of war to return from Vietnam, in 1979. Mr. Garwood had remained behind as a defector when 561 prisoners were returned by Hanoi in 1973 and was later court-martialed. He has maintained that other Americans were alive in Vietnam when he left.  ""The committe has already proved that prior investigations were not complete,"" Senator Kerry said. ""Evidence is now avilable and forthcoming that has not been presented previously. No one has ever surfaced admitting Soviet involvement. Or with information that we left anyone behind.""  Senator Kerry said he hoped to gather enough information to hold public hearings by the end of January. His committee plans to visit Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in February to present new evidence to the authorities there and to demonstrate to the American committee members what the realities of searching for evidence in Vietnam are, the Senator said.

"      A special Senate committee investigating cases of Americans unaccounted for since the Vietnam War has issued a subpoena to President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, demanding that he turn over documents the White House has withheld since January, Administration officials said today.  The documents being sought by the committee should, among other things, explain why the White House closed the books on most missing-in-action cases in 1973.  The Administration officials said the White House was talking with the committee and hoped to work out an agreement. Members of the White House staff rarely receive subpoenas, and they are usually rejected on the grounds of Presidential privilege.  Frustration with the White House has been reported growing in the investigating unit, the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, which hopes to wind up by the end of this year what it describes as the most comprehensive review of missing Americans. The issue is blocking the opening of diplomatic relations with Hanoi.  What the Senate Wants  The committee has made two detailed requests for information about the handling of the issue in the mid-1970's, when Mr. Scowcroft was also national security adviser. George Bush was then Director of Central Intelligence.  According to copies of those requests, the committee is particularly interested in the decision-making process that led to an announcement in April 1973 that the United States no longer believed Americans were in captivity in Indochina. By then, the last American combat troops had been withdrawn from Vietnam and Hanoi had told Washington that it had released or accounted for all prisoners.  That public position, and on what evidence it was formed, is central to the renewed debate. The Senate committee has heard testimony in closed and open sessions that strongly suggests that officials knew in 1973 of credible reports of Americans still alive in Vietnam and Laos, but chose to put aside that information in an effort to make a clean break with the war.  Talking to Russia  The confrontation between the Senate committee and the White House comes as a new United States-Russia commission prepares for talks in Moscow on Thursday on information now available about Americans missing in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The White House announced the formation of the commission on Friday.  The commission, which includes officials from the Defense Department, State Department and Congress, is headed by Malcolm Toon, who was Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1976 to 1979. A Russian military officer, Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, will lead the Russian side.  Senators John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, the chairman and the vice chairman of the Senate committee, are also members of the commission. They went to Moscow in February to lay the groundwork and are not part of this week's delegation. They plan a trip to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia beginning on April 17.  The persistent belief that a number of Americans might have been left in Vietnam has fueled a vociferous and dedicated lobby of families of missing service personnel who have continued to demand a fuller accounting. Several earlier investigations have not convinced this group that the whole story of the missing has been told.  Dolores Apodaca Alfond, chairwoman of the National Alliance of Families, based in Seattle, described in an interview today how her family was drawn into action on the issue by the case of her missing brother, Maj. Victor J. Apodaca.  A graduate of the Air Force Academy who spoke Russian, Major Apodaca was shot down over Vietnam in 1967. He was first listed as ""possible P.O.W.,"" she said, and a former serviceman who monitored Vietnamese radio broadcasts told her he was certain that her brother had been taken to Moscow as a prisoner.  In 1989, her family received two boxes of remains and effects turned over by the Vietnamese as possibly his. The bones were found to be those of animals, she said.  A few weeks ago, Mrs. Alfond said, she was suddenly advised that her brother was now considered a ""discrepancy case,"" meaning that the United States had questions about his fate that might be resolved in Vietnam. She does not know why there is new interest in his fate.  ""Families don't believe anyone in the Government any more,"" she said.  Plea for Documents  Senator Kerry, a Vietnam veteran and a critic of the war who hoped as chairman of the committee to put the issue to rest, told reporters in February that a few months of preliminary research had convinced him that there was far more information to be uncovered than he had expected.  He said it was hard to understand how repeated earlier investigations, ""dubbed the highest national priority, could leave so many stones unturned.""  The committee has been able to obtain documents from the Pentagon, where a spokeswoman said today that officials were in daily contact with the committee's staff.  Senator John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona and a member of the select committee, introduced a provision in the 1992-93 defense budget that mandates cooperation with the Senate in turning over all requested files.  A Pentagon official, Alan Ptak, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, who has overall responsibility for policy on the issue since his position was created early this year, is now in Moscow as part of the American-Russian commission.

"    The Bush Administration may have buried the ""Vietnam syndrome"" in Kuwait, but another legacy of the Vietnam War keeps corroding public confidence in government: the M.I.A.'s. There is little responsible support for the idea that Americans missing in action are still being held against their will in Indochina. Yet polls show that a majority of Americans thinks they are.  That popular view is now being reinforced by sensational allegations from Gen. Oleg Kalugin, a former top K.G.B. official. General Kalugin claims that U.S. prisoners of war were interrogated by K.G.B. agents inside the Soviet Union years after Hanoi supposedly returned all living prisoners to the United States. He'll meet with Administration officials this week.  The general's story has credibility problems but warrants careful examination. That's what it is now likely to get, thanks to the new Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, headed by John Kerry of Massachusetts and Robert Smith of New Hampshire, both Vietnam veterans. The committee also includes Senator John McCain, a former P.O.W. Staff members have already taken sworn depositions from the general.  More than a thousand Americans remain officially listed as missing in action. Vietnam insists that it is concealing no Americans or remains. The Pentagon believes no live Americans are being held, but presses Hanoi for information on about 100 so-called discrepancy cases, where there is reason to suspect Vietnam might have further information.  But the Pentagon has a credibility problem. In the first years after the war, it did a poor job of publicizing the search for M.I.A.'s, leaving many affected families unconvinced that everything possible was being done.  Those feelings of uncertainty were further inflamed by a misguided U.S. diplomatic policy of isolating and demonizing Vietnam. Conspiracy theorists flourished, arguing that the Pentagon abandoned the M.I.A. search for reasons of its own convenience and has subsequently worked to cover up that abandonment.  The Senate Select Committee plans a yearlong investigation, interviewing Americans, Indochinese and others who have been involved one way or another in the search process. It may seek further information from Moscow, and plans a trip next month to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia during which senators can assess the cooperativeness of those governments.  Every war leaves behind unknown soldiers, missing remains and other mysteries. In fact, there are far more unaccounted-for Vietnamese soldiers and civilians than American. That does not diminish the frustrations felt by America's M.I.A. families. They deserve a conscientious and compassionate response.  By doing its job well, the committee can reduce the vulnerability of those families to unscrupulous con artists. And it can help heal a national wound that still festers almost 20 years after President Nixon ordered the last U.S. troops out of Vietnam.

"     NO LONGER ENEMIES, NOT YET FRIENDS An American Soldier Returns to Vietnam. By Frederick Downs. Illustrated. 352 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $22.95.  PERHAPS, at last, it is over. If a man like Frederick Downs -- a former United States Army officer who lost his left arm to a Vietcong land mine in 1968, a man who until four years ago still hated his old enemy, a self-proclaimed patriot ever willing to fight for the flag -- if such a man can hand his colicky young daughter to a former North Vietnamese battlefield surgeon, then watch with wonder while this Communist rocks the child and soothes her with Vietnamese lullabies, then the war that never seems to end surely must be over.  A number of veterans of the war in Vietnam have taken up the pen in the last few years, but none seem to have come as far morally -- and perhaps politically -- as Frederick Downs. Make no mistake, he is still a Republican with war trophies on his walls, but now he is a man committed to a humanitarian role. And the sweet irony is that it was his old enemy that gave him back his humanity.  ""No Longer Enemies, Not Yet Friends"" is an account of the five trips Mr. Downs made to Vietnam in 1987 and 1988 as part of the Reagan Administration's effort to prod the Vietnamese Government into helping to account for the roughly 2,400 American servicemen still missing in action in Indochina. Under the direction of a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., Mr. Downs, who is the director of prosthetics for the Veterans Administration, was assigned to a team whose mission it was to assess Vietnam's medical needs -- everything from artificial limbs to aid for blind children.  It is unfortunate that Mr. Downs is not a better writer. His prose can be wooden, his reporting perfunctory, his vision too often shallow. This is his third book, and he should have been made to shape his material. But matters of language and structure aside, this is a remarkable story because in its approach and its unaffected voice, it illustrates the capacity of a man who had been savaged by battle to renew himself. And the venue in which this takes place is in the very heart of what to Mr. Downs is hostile territory: Hanoi, the enemy capital.  Almost from his first moments in the city, Mr. Downs began to discover that it was not faceless ciphers he faced and has been harboring a bitter hatred for all these years. Soon, he started to connect with people: his opposite numbers at the negotiating table, minor officials, doctors, patients, shopkeepers, drivers and so on. He watches them exercise in the park or play with their children or nurse a warm beer over a long conversation late into the night.  As we follow Mr. Downs through his sessions in the diplomatic hall or his strolls through the city or his visits to country clinics and hospitals, we watch him slowly surrender his old intractable notions and prejudices until at last he comes to see his enemy -- a foe that took his arm and with it some of his dignity -- not just as three-dimensional, but, in fact, as an extension of himself.  ALONG the way, we also get a picture of the desperate state of Hanoi, the capital of our old nemesis. Mr. Downs tells us it is a place so poor that cosmetics are sold by the smear from doorways and ball-point pens are refilled rather than thrown away. Maids in the Government guest house shave soap bars when they clean the rooms and pinch the shavings to wash their family's laundry. Vietnam, he tells us, is a place of rampant polio and high infant and maternal mortality. Twenty percent of children's deaths are attributable to diarrhea; their mothers believe the cure is to starve them or feed them crushed dried grasshoppers. Nothing works -- not electrical plants, not cars, not machinery to make artificial limbs. A California eye bank donated 15 eyes to a Hanoi clinic for cornea transplants, but the operations were a disaster because the Vietnamese doctors did not have surgical gloves, and the infections that resulted left 12 of the patients as blind as before.  Near the end of the book, one of the Vietnamese negotiators, Dr. Bui Tung, is invited to the United States to attend a meeting of military orthopedic surgeons. During his visit, this former army surgeon spends a good deal of time in the Downs home in Maryland. And it is during one of these visits that he gently walks the kitchen floor with Mr. Downs's crying daughter, Abigail, in his arms.  ""I watched this tableau from the doorway, measuring it against scenes from my past,"" Mr. Downs writes. ""I knew that if our countries went to war the next day, both Tung and I would dutifully become enemies again. . . . The difference would be, now that I knew him, I would not take any joy in his death, only sorrow at the ways of man.""  This is the way with enemies, this is the way with friends.    SEARCH-AND-ENJOY  The trip through the Vietnamese countryside was something I never tired of. People were working everywhere: in the fields, along the road, hoeing, chopping wood, fishing, herding ducks, planting, making bricks, herding buffalo and cows.  The villages we drove by on these back roads always reminded me of the war. Villages had always meant Vietnam to me. During the war, my platoon and I lived next to villages and patrolled through them. In contested territory I had burned villages as part of search-and-destroy operations, searched through the ""hootches"" looking for contraband, made prisoners of anyone in the villages I suspected of being a bad guy, destroyed the stored rice we found if we thought it was being used to support the enemy. There were times we had fired into the villages because the enemy was there among the people. All of these actions were part of our job and we were rewarded for doing it well.  In fact, in those days I never thought of the villages as anything other than a cluster of meaningless primitive straw and mud huts. I knew people lived in the ""hootches,"" but I never thought of them as homes. I never thought of myself as destroying someone's home.  I did not realize or care that the villages were the history, the guts and the backbone of Vietnam. -- From ""No Longer Enemies, Not Yet Friends.""

"      The special Senate committee that is looking into cases of Americans still missing from the Vietnam war is planning to take the unusual step of going to Indochina to conduct investigations and hearings in February, a committee spokeswoman said today.  The Senators hope to visit Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam Feb. 7 to 18, the spokeswoman, Deborah De Young, said. It will also meet with American officials in Bangkok assigned to investigate information about the 2,273 Americans still unaccounted for.  A resurgence of interest in the issue last year led to the formation of the panel, the Senate Select Committee of P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, at about the same time new suggestions that Hanoi may have been withholding information on Americans began to emerge from the crumbling Soviet Union, which supported Vietnam in the war.  A former K.G.B. officer, Gen. Oleg D. Kalugin, who has charged that Soviet interrogators interviewed Americans after 1973, when Hanoi said it had returned all prisoners of war, was today challenged by another K.G.B. official who served as an interrogator in Vietnam after the war.  The second officer, Oleg Nechiporenko, was interviewed with General Kalugin on the NBC program ""Today."" Mr. Nechiporenko said he had been in Vietnam twice, once at the time of the American peace treaty in January 1973 and again around 1976. He said he spoke with an American only once, in 1973. On the later trip he was given information on other Americans, he said, but did not interrogate them.  He said he could not support General Kalugin's contention that at least three Americans were interrogated by Soviet agents from 1975 to 1978.  American Defends Kalugin  A former Central Intelligence Agency officer in Vietnam, Frank Snepp, did come to General Kalugin's defense today. Mr. Snepp, the author of ""Decent Interval,"" a book that accused the United States of having left intelligence agents behind at the end of the war, said in an interview that ""Kalugin cannot be easily dismissed.""  He said one of the three people General Kalugin had referred to in interviews may have been Tucker Gougleman, a retired C.I.A. agent who died in 1977 under what Mr. Snepp in his book concluded was Soviet interrogation.  ""Kalugin may be the first of several people who come forward with new information not only on this issue but on other issues,"" Mr. Snepp said. He said agents from other former Soviet bloc countries may also have information that will shed new light on the issue.

"      The Bush Administration is preparing to send the highest-level official delegation to Vietnam since the end of the war, led by Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon, diplomats and Congressional aides say.  The State Department declined today to comment on the reports, but an announcement of the mission is expected this week. The Administration team, which is to leave on Saturday, is apparently planning to visit Laos and Cambodia as well as Vietnam.  There is speculation in Congress that the United States may be moving toward a new phase in relations with Hanoi. Under a ""road map"" presented to the Vietnamese a year ago, faster progress on solving cases of missing Americans would lead to a partial relaxation in an American embargo that has frozen Vietnam out of trade and blocked assistance from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.  The Bush Administration, which eased travel restrictions for Americans at the end of last year, has said that the next step will be to allow American companies to set up offices and negotiate, but not sign, agreements with the Vietnamese. The oil, communications and consulting industries have been lobbying for openings, fearful that they will lose out to Japanese, Korean, Singaporean and other Asian competitors.  The final steps, not expected until after the 1992 Presidential election, would be a lifting of the embargo and the establishment of diplomatic relations.  Mr. Solomon met with the Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, Le Mai, in New York in November, the first of what was described as a series of high-level meetings made possible by the peace accord on Cambodia reached in October with the help of Hanoi. In an interview after that meeting, Mr. Mai said he thought it might be possible to advance a stage this spring.  The visit of Mr. Solomon, head of the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, follows the arrival in Hanoi this week of Brig. Gen. Thomas Needham, who heads a new United States military task force on the issue of the 2,267 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina, including 1,656 in Vietnam.

"    To the Editor:  I was bewildered on reading your Jan. 13 editorial on the continuing question of U.S. servicemen missing in action in Vietnam. At no time in the United States or anywhere else did I say, as you assert, that American prisoners of war were interrogated by K.G.B. agents inside the Soviet Union years after the war was over. The public record shows that all my statements on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue related to a handful of American servicemen who were interviewed by Soviet intelligence officers in Vietnam, not in the Soviet Union.  I first broached this subject many months ago, and cited it simply as a K.G.B. field operation, just another episode in the cold war. All my later statements are based not so much on my own recollections as on conversations with my former subordinate, Col. Oleg Nechiporenko, who elaborated on the circumstances of his two visits to Vietnam.  These conversations took place from September to December 1991 after several journalists and at least two United States officials asked me to clarify certain points.  I must admit I was shocked and chagrined by Colonel Nechiporenko's retraction of his own words, a cowardly act prompted and probably dictated by his former superiors in the intelligence service. But this is yet another story that merits separate consideration.  I fully comprehend the emotional side of the P.O.W. story and sympathize with American families as well as with untold numbers of Vietnamese whose kin fell victim to the war.  For this reason, I suggest we look beyond the inaccuracies and discrepancies, however nagging they may be, and concentrate on the principal issue: Are there United States P.O.W.'s still in Vietnam? Are they kept against their will in concentration camps or solitary confinement?  One may call my statement risky, but I do state unequivocally that I see no reason -- political, military, economic or practical -- why the Vietnamese should keep any United States servicemen in detention. Vietnam is far more interested in normalizing its relations with the United States than in creating additional obstacles to progress in this area.  I do not exclude a possibility that a few former U.S. servicemen, for personal or other reasons, got stuck in Vietnam or neighboring countries, but I'm sure that was their choice rather than due to pressure from local authorities or deliberate policies of the Vietnamese Government.  I hope the joint U.S.-Vietnamese commission now set up to look into the matter and possibly a similar U.S.-Russian commission will produce sufficient evidence to eliminate suspicions and unwarranted accusations from whatever source.

"      A Senate committee investigating the fate of Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War has turned its attention to reports that satellite photography may have picked up messages from prisoners as late as 1988.  The panel, the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, plans to hold hearings on this issue on Oct. 15 and 16 but has not decided how much will be public, Senator John F.

""My general approach to government is: If in doubt, have it out in the open."" Many officials are reluctant to risk discussion of intelligence-gathering methods in public.  The photographs under investigation, analyzed in newly released Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency documents, seemed to show letters or symbols marked on the ground or incorporated in building markings. The signs appear to match those that service personnel were told to use to identify their locations in captivity.  Some analysts concede the possibility that the symbols could be military code, but say they have no evidence that Americans created them. Vietnam has insisted since 1973 that all American prisoners of war, including those in Laos, were returned that year.  The two most compelling cases of apparent messages involve markings spotted on the roof of the Dong Mang prison camp, near Cam Pha in northern Vietnam, in May 1976, and the letters ""USA"" and possibly ""K"" -- an assigned code -- seen on a ricefield near Sam Neua, Laos, in 1988.  The C.I.A. analyzed the Dong Mang report in July 1976 and concluded, ""We were unable to find any conclusive evidence that this prison might contain American P.O.W.'s.""  Photographs apparently showed a pattern worked into roof coverings during repair work. One of the symbols appeared to be ""K"" in Morse code; others, less clear, may have read ""NT"" and ""TA."" Analysts have not explained what those letters might mean.  In the Laotian ricefield, a January 1988 photo picked up ""USA"" in 11-foot-tall letters over an area where it had not been the previous autumn and would not be the following spring. The ""K"" seemed an older marking.  ""Paddies in this area are generally harvested in October or November and are allowed to remain fallow until planting season in February or March,"" a Government report said in December 1988. ""It is likely that the symbol was made after the 1987 harvest, but before the paddy was replowed and flooded for the 1988 planting.""  Missing Americans were known to have disappeared in the area. But American-backed anti-Government Laotians also operated there, and United States officials in Southeast Asia suspect that the letters could have been dug into the ground by the rebels, some of whom have close ties with Americans who have been active in the P.O.W.-M.I.A issue.  Some of those Americans are veterans who may have known the location codes, leading some analysts to say that both the Americans and the rebels might want to embarrass the Communist Government of Laos and publicize the issue in the United States.  Today, the committee released closed-door testimony given on July 1 by Ross Perot, the Texas businessman and candidate for President. A large part related to his trips to Vietnam and Laos in 1969 and 1970.  Mr. Perot told the committee counsel that on several occasions between 1969 and 1987, he had discussed possible trades of money or equipment for prisoners. Once, in 1970, Mr. Perot said, the North Vietnamese Ambassador in Laos offered to release prisoners in return for medical equipment.  Mr. Perot also said in July and in public testimony in August that he had met several times with a Communist Pathet Lao official who, he said, acknowledged holding prisoners.

"      A top American intelligence official said today that two sets of large symbols etched into the ground in Laos in 1973 and 1988 were almost certainly human-made signs intended to send a message. But the official said experts had not been able to prove or disprove that they were distress signals from stranded American prisoners of war.  In the first case, the figures ""1973"" or ""1573"" with a ""TH"" or ""TA"" were spotted, apparently by satellite, gouged into a field in the Plain of Jars in May and June 1973, after all American prisoners were reported returned. In January 1988, Central Intelligence Agency surveillance picked up a ""USA"" dug into a rice field near Sam Neua, along with what was possibly a ""K"" made of rice stalks.  Experts said the could not rule out that these were attempts to display coded symbols that American pilots had been taught to use to attract attention if they were captured.  ""These symbols were clearly intended to send a signal to someone above, and we cannot explain them today,"" said the official, Duane Andrews, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence. He was testifying before the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs at the start of two days of hearings, some in closed session, on intelligence-gathering and covert operations involving missing Americans.  The existence of these symbols is an important factor in the debate over whether and where Americans may have remained in captivity in Indochina after United States forces were withdrawn in early 1973. Many other symbols also produced by satellite or reconnaissance imagery have been declared by Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency experts to be natural formations on the ground.  Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and the committee chairman, cautioned today against irresponsible conclusions that would mislead families.  ""The American public is listening very carefully,"" he said. ""If we pretend to them that something is a symbol when it's not, we are raising false hopes.""  But two other Senators on the committee, Bob Smith of New Hampshire and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, both Republicans, were critical of the Pentagon analysts, whom they accused of trying to debunk what looked like powerful evidence.  The committee has agreed to call in independent analysts to look at Defense Department material.  This weekend, President Bush's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., will lead a team to Hanoi to renew discussions on the missing in the light of repeated testimony in recent months that the Governments of Vietnam and Laos know more about the fates of many Americans than they have revealed in nearly two decades.  The United States lists 2,265 Americans still unaccounted for since the war, of which cases about 130 or 135 could be resolved by Hanoi with existing archival information, it is believed.  Three former Secretaries of Defense have told the Senate committee that they believed that some Americans might have been alive in Indochina when the war ended, but were not returned or accounted for by Hanoi.  It was evident in the disagreements during the hearings today that experts are not in complete accord about the handling of some satellite imagery in cases where symbols have been detected in Indochina.  Two officials of the Joint Services Search, Evasion, Rescue and Escape Agency, which trains American service personnel in emergency techniques, said they had seen what they thought were credible photographs of coded symbols in various locations in Vietnam and Laos. But they said they had been convinced by the Defense Intelligence Agency that imagery enhancement had proved the names and numbers they saw did not in fact exist.  In several critical cases, long periods of time elapsed between the finding and analysis of some symbols. Various branches of the armed services were not always sharing information.  No 'Authenticator' List'  Mr. Andrews acknowledged today that there was no comprehensive list of ""authenticator"" numbers assigned to each pilot or crew flying into enemy territory. Without such a readily available list, numbers or letters picked up from the ground could not always be quickly checked for clues that could correlate to missing servicemen.  The 1988 symbols, in particular a giant ""USA"" in letters nearly 11 feet high, were spotted accidentally during Central Intelligence Agency surveillance of an area in Laos near the Vietnamese border in January. But Mr. Andrews said they were not analyzed by the Pentagon until the next December.  What looked like the letter ""K"" found near the ""USA"" was considered important by some analysts, because a K with a specially assigned modification, called a ""walking K,"" was a generic signal of distress at the time.

"   , Vietnam, Oct. 17   A high-ranking delegation from the United States arrived in Hanoi today to meet with Vietnamese officials on way of speeding cooperation to determine the fate of American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War.  The special Presidential envoy on the missing, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr. , said that joint search efforts had improved since his last visit to Vietnam in January.  ""We're making progress,"" he said.  General Vessey is to meet on Sunday with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Defense Minister Doan Khue. Among the officials accompanying him are Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth Quinn; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Alan Ptak; Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona; Ann Mills Griffiths, head of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, and Maj. Gen. Thomas Needham, commander of a military task force on the subject.  LOAD-DATE: October 18, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 18 1992 ,11
"      Vietnam and the United States have moved closer to establishing diplomatic relations after two days of talks in Hanoi between a high-level Bush Administration delegation and Vietnamese leaders, the State Department said today.  During the meetings, Hanoi pledged to open to American inspection all archival material relating to American servicemen unaccounted for since the Vietnam War, according to a joint statement issued by Vietnamese officials and the leader of the United States team, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general.  ""General Vessey indicated in the context of accelerated cooperation to resolve the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue, the U.S. would move more rapidly toward normalization,"" said Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman.  The talks were hurriedly arranged by the Administration after Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, was invited to Washington two weeks ago for talks with Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.  Photos Shown to Vietnamese  At that meeting, the United States apparently presented the Vietnamese with information from Vietnam's own files that revealed Hanoi knew more than it has acknowledged about some cases of missing Americans.  According to officials involved in independent investigations of the issue here and in Southeast Asia, the material shown to the Vietnamese included photographs smuggled out of the country depicting gruesome scenes of Americans mutilated in crashes and military encounters or executed by their Vietnamese captors.  Information that has emerged in recent hearings of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A Affairs has also indicated that Hanoi may have information it has withheld from American officials for nearly 20 years.  A resolution of some cases of missing Americans has been the last hurdle to lifting an American economic embargo and recognizing Hanoi.  November Visit by Senators  Some Pentagon officials said they believed that Vietnam might also be preparing to release more American remains in the next few weeks, perhaps in advance of a committee visit to Hanoi planned for mid-November.  General Vessey, the President's special envoy to Hanoi, will brief Mr. Bush on his visit on Wednesday or Thursday, the White House said today.  The timing of these new moves is the subject of speculation here among both supporters and critics of improved relations with Vietnam. Experts say Vietnam's leaders are uncertain of what to expect from a Clinton Administration, while they are on a clearly defined ""road map"" to recognition devised by the Bush State Department.  Douglas Pike, the scholar who has written a history of the Vietnamese Army, said today that Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi asked him over the summer what more they could do to close this issue.  Vietnamese Politics Are Cited  ""I would just advise them to overwhelm us with candor,"" he said, citing the example of Russia. Mr. Pike, director of the Indochina studies at the University of California at Berkeley, said objections to sharing more information had apparently come from civilian security officials in Vietnam and not the military.  He said that in the mid-1980's, military objections to ""doling out bones"" were reliably reported to have been overruled in the Vietnamese Politburo by civilians in control of policy toward the United States.  ""My general sense is that they were deliberately not telling us things they knew, and I think the basic reason was politics.""  In Washington, the Bush Administration has been under pressure from American businesses to end the embargo so that they can compete in the rebuilding and industrialization of the country before all the contracts go to the Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese and Europeans, most of whom have embassies in Hanoi.  Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, an independent organization supported by American companies, said today that Vietnam, which would like to involve American oil companies in the development of a block of offshore oil concessions in the South China Sea, is being pressed to award contracts soon.  ""If Vietnam awards those blocks, that will be pretty much the end of the American role in development of the Vietnamese oil industry,"" she said.  She added that Japan, in addition to trading with Vietnam, is preparing to resume direct foreign aid in contravention of American wishes. France is at the same time trying to arrange for Vietnam's return to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, where Washington had consistently vetoed aid to Hanoi.

"      The Pentagon has obtained up to 5,000 photographs of dead Americans from Vietnam that may help clear up the fate of some missing servicemen, American officials and researchers said today.  The photos are reported to be with the Defense Intelligence Agency, where officials are still examining them. There is no independent way to verify their authenticity, and it is too early to determine how many cases of missing servicemen might be resolved with the pictures.  Although one Vietnamese official is said to have passed along the photographs, Government and private analysts are convinced that they could not have been removed from military archives in Vietnam without the tacit compliance of higher-ranking officials, possibly in the Ministry of Defense, who wanted to put an end to the long-running dispute that has blocked United States diplomatic recognition, trade and investment.  Members of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A Affairs were told about the photographs in closed briefings in September and October. But reports about the pictures, showing Americans who died in military action or were killed by their Vietnamese captors, began to surface only in recent days as a high-level Presidential delegation made a quick trip to Hanoi to discuss the new evidence.  Praise From President  The Bush Administration praised Hanoi for its candor in declaring on Monday that it would open its archives to search for information requested by Washington. Officials also know, however, that critical information has been coming out for several months.  An American analyst called the joint statement issued Monday in Hanoi a ""fig leaf"" offered to the Vietnamese by John W. Vessey Jr., the retired Army general who serves as President Bush's special envoy to Hanoi on this issue. General Vessey returned tonight from Vietnam and is expected to brief President Bush on Thursday.  Mr. Vessey's hurriedly assembled delegation included Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam and now a member of the Select Committee; Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kenneth M. Quinn, the State Department's representative on the issue; Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Alan C. Ptak, and Ann Mills Griffiths, director of the National League of Families.  A member of Senator McCain's staff said today that P.O.W.-M.I.A family members would be told Wednesday about the results of the Hanoi talks.  Research on Vietnamese  According to accounts supplied by officials and analysts here and in Southeast Asia, the first breach in the wall of security Hanoi has maintained on information regarding Americans was made early this year by an American researching the Vietnamese Army.  While studying Government archives, the American -- who has been identified by several people but is not being named because it has not been possible to reach him -- began to photograph artifacts like dog tags found in a military collection and gave the photos to the Pentagon.  Several months later, a large number of photographs was made available to Americans by a Vietnamese official at another documentation center.  In September, Defense Department officials briefed the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee, John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, on the new material. The full committee was told about the photographs earlier this month by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.  Were Archives Extensive?  American officials who have worked on the issue most closely say Hanoi maintained extensive archives about American prisoners and the American bodies recovered. Vietnam's repeated denials that it had such information frustrated the officials, who were under constant criticism and pressure from families of missing servicemen.  The United States, which has had a office in Hanoi since the summer of 1991 to work on the cases of 2,265 Americans still unaccounted for, also has 50 or more people scattered around Vietnam at certain times checking ""live sighting"" reports.  For more than a decade, Vietnamese ministries have demonstrated a wide range of attitudes toward cooperating with Washington on the issue, with hard-liners in the Interior Ministry the most negative and Foreign Ministry officials the most accommodating.  The military has often been a mystery, taking unpredictable or inconsistent stands. But in September, Le Duc Anh, a maverick general with a reputation for solving problems, became President of Vietnam under a sweeping Government reorganization.  ""I suspect he just weighed in on this,"" said Douglas Pike, a historian of the Vietnamese Army and director of the Indochina Studies Program at the University of California at Berkeley.  ""Anh is a key figure,"" Mr. Pike said. ""He is the czar on dealing with China, and maybe this extends to other foreign policy issues. He's in an ideal position as a military leader to fix the M.I.A. problem.""  At the same time, he said, the President ""is known in Hanoi as Mr. Security."" For those who may worry that relaxation of relations with Washington will bring a blowup on the order of Tiananmen Square or Moscow in 1991, ""Anh is the guy who will see it will not happen.""

"      American archivists will travel to Vietnam at the end of this month to begin reviewing documents and photographs from Hanoi's files to help resolve questions about the fate of missing American servicemen, Administration officials said today.  Hanoi announced on Monday that it would open its archives to search for information requested from Washington. Vietnam's decision came after senior Administration officials confronted Hanoi's leadership with information the Pentagon obtained from Vietnam's archives in recent months, including as many as 5,000 photographs of dead Americans.  Separately, a team of 63 American specialists began a monthlong field visit today to 11 Vietnamese provinces to hold interviews and examine sites where American aircraft are believed to have crashed, in connection with 78 cases of missing servicemen. The field visit, the 20th involving American and Vietnamese personnel since 1988, was planned last month.  John W. Vessey Jr., the retired Army general who serves as President Bush's special envoy to Hanoi on this issue, returned Tuesday night from a quick visit to Vietnam to press for broader access to the files. General Vessey was expected to brief Mr. Bush on Friday morning on the results of the trip.  Vessey to Brief Bush  While General Vessey brought back some new information from his latest trip, Administration officials said the broader significance was gaining Hanoi's commitment to open its archives, which could provide ""new leads and corroborating evidence to what we already have.""  One Administration official said Vietnam would collect information from archives across the country and make the information available to American archivists assigned to military teams in Hanoi and Bangkok.  General Vessey was also expected to brief Mr. Bush on the internal Vietnamese political considerations that resulted in Hanoi tacitly approving the transfer of Vietnamese records over the last several months to an American researcher, who in turn passed the information to the Pentagon.  Administration and congressional officials said General Vessey would also relay to Mr. Bush Hanoi's linkage of the broader archival access to diplomatic recognition by Washington.  Many Photos 'of Debris'  General Vessey met today with Acting Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, but State Department officials declined to comment on the briefing until General Vessey discussed his trip with Mr. Bush.  An Administration official said today that ""only a limited number"" of the 5,000 photographs given to the United States so far have been useful.  ""A lot of them are just pictures of a lot of debris on the ground,"" the official said. ""But if we can piece together from the pictures where and when the plane crashed, we can check our records to see what plane was lost on that date and place.""  There are 2,265 Americans still listed as unaccounted for in Indochina, though American officials say the number of truly unresolved cases is less than 200.

"      President Bush said today that the acquisition of thousands of Vietnamese photographs of the bodies of American servicemen was a ""major breakthrough"" in accounting for missing Americans. But he said he would have to determine ""exactly how major"" before deciding to move toward diplomatic recognition of Hanoi.  The President also said, in an interview with CBS News, that he would like to see Vietnam become democratic, and seemed to suggest that this might be a factor in his decision, or related to it. ""We're not that far along,"" he said.  As the Pentagon continued its analysis of nearly 5,000 photographs obtained from Vietnamese military archives, including many pictures of crash sites, a few families of missing Americans have been notified that there is now substantial evidence that their relatives died in Vietnam, officials said. One of the missing now known to have perished in enemy hands was an Air Force officer who had been unaccounted for since parachuting into North Vietnamese territory in 1968.  Case of 2 Combat Pilots  The officer, Maj. Joseph C. Morrison of the Air Force, parachuted from an F4-D fighter plane over North Vietnam on Nov. 25, 1968, along with Capt. San D. Francisco.  Both officers established radio communication with United States forces from the ground, indicating they were alive. The Pentagon said that they landed about 700 yards from a North Vietnamese encampment.  Contact with Captain Francisco was lost in half an hour, and he is still listed as unaccounted for. But Major Morrison escaped and was able to resume communication the next day with rescuers trying to pin down his location. Bad weather prevented a rescue, however, and contact with Major Morrison was lost.  The case of Major Morrison -- now listed as Colonel Morrison because promotions continued to accrue while he was missing -- was never explained by Vietnam. It was one of the ""discrepancy cases"" presented to the Vietnamese for early resolution by John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general who serves as a special Presidential envoy to Hanoi.  Officials said that about two-thirds of the pictures are duplicates, and others are often grainy and hard to decipher. More important, investigators said, will be the correlation of photographs to Pentagon files and archival documents Hanoi has promised to open to American inspection.  ""From the descriptions that I have read about these photographs, they are unique in number,"" said Roger Shields, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in charge of P.O.W-M.I.A. accounting at the end of the war. ""But over the years, we have had many other photographs come into our possession, some through public sources, showing men dead with their aircraft, or ostensible grave sites. We knew these photos existed. This large group just demonstratets that the Vietnamese did this systematically.  ""We had told them so often we were interested in accounting that they knew this was important,"" the former Pentagon official said. Some relatives of servicemen unaccounted for think Hanoi intended to use the information to bargain for American aid.  The United States lists 2,265 servicemen as unaccounted for in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia since the Vietnam War. Of this number about 1,100 are officially listed as ""killed in action"" but their bodies have not been recovered.  The rest are listed as ""missing in action,"" although officials believe there is scant chance that any survived.  Over the last few years, a list of 130 to 135 names has been compiled of ""discrepancy cases."" Hanoi could close these files because the men, who were reliably believed to have survived crashes or other military action, probably fell into Vietnamese custody. Officials think most if not all of them are dead, but need firm evidence to close the cases.  U.S. Mission to Vietnam  The President will be briefed on Friday on the results of a high-level American mission sent to Vietnam last weekend to discuss the issue. The interdepartmental delegation was led by Mr. Vessey. President Bush said today that he believed that the Vietnamese still knew more than they were telling Americans and that it would be precipitous to move too fast in establishing diplomatic relations.  'We're not going to do this until I can say in in total conscience, clear conscience to the missing-in-action families and P.O.W. families, 'Here is a full accounting,' "" said Mr. Bush, who was heckled in July as he tried to address a family group's annual convention.  ""But I'd like to see full relations,"" the President said today. ""I'd like to see that nation become democratic and fit into Asean and and come along in the future."" Asean is the free-enterprise Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Hanoi wants to join.  Although the resolution of cases of American servicemen still unaccounted for nearly two decades after the United States withdrew from Vietnam remains the major roadblock to diplomatic ties and American aid, Vietnamese exile groups, some members of Congress and human rights organizations are beginning to advocate increased pressure on Vietnam to move toward democracy.

"      President Bush said today that Hanoi had agreed to turn over to the United States all documents, pictures and personal effects relating to American servicemen during the Vietnam War. Administration officials said the pledge was likely to lead to a review of American policy toward Vietnam.  The move is the most decisive and far-reaching Vietnam has made in nearly two decades to meet American demands for the fullest possible accounting of the missing. For years, Vietnam denied that there was any more to show or tell, and Washington refused to establish diplomatic relations with the Hanoi Government and blocked international aid to one of Asia's poorest countries.  ""Today, finally, I am convinced that we can begin writing the last chapter of the Vietnam War,"" Mr. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. ""It was a bitter conflict, but Hanoi knows today that we seek only answers without the threat of retribution for the past.""  He said the United States would increase assistance to Vietnam -- initially about $25,000 more for flood relief, according to reports from Hanoi -- and would begin helping the Vietnamese find and identify their own combatants missing in action.  Vietnamese leaders are no longer asking for the $4.2 billion in reparations they long insisted President Nixon promised in 1973, an Administration official said today.  President Bush did not mention the possibility of diplomatic recognition of Vietnam or a lifting of an American-led international embargo, but there is strong speculation that he might move to normalize relations with Vietnam before his term ends in January.  The President's announcement was welcomed by aid organizations, scholars and business leaders who have advocated an end to the isolation of Hanoi.  John McAuliff, executive director of United States-Indochina Reconciliation Project and coordinator of private and religious efforts to assist Vietnam, said today that it was the hope of many that the next Administration would take steps ""as dramatic as the unprecedented willingness of the Vietnamese to open their military archives and their countryside to foreign investigators.""  Skepticism and Suspicion  Some members of the families of the missing were skeptical of Hanoi's intentions or said they suspected political motives on the part of President Bush, whose campaign appears to need all the boosts it can get.  ""If the Vietnamese have given us 5,000 photographs, what else have they been keeping from us?"" said Dolores Apodaca Alfond, head of the National Alliance of Families and sister of a missing pilot.  She was referring to a trove of photographs now being analyzed by the Defense Intelligence Agency. Pentagon officials said today that the photos had been collected by the Government over the last several months and were not a direct result of Hanoi's new pledge.  As he spoke this morning, the President was flanked by his special envoy to Hanoi, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and by Democratic and Republican senators who have been investigating the cases of missing Americans through a Senate committee.  Researchers Bound for Hanoi  At the Pentagon today, officials were cautiously optimistic that they had reached a turning point in nearly 20 years of investigations. The United States still lists 2,265 Americans unaccounted for in Indochina. More than half are known to be dead, but their bodies have not been recovered. The others are listed as missing, but officials assume that virtually all are dead.  Pentagon officials said the material turned over to Washington so far was just the beginning. The United States and Vietnam have agreed that American archivists and Pentagon experts will begin research on the missing in Hanoi at the end of this month.  Pentagon officials said today that some of the 4,800 photographs were given to the Pentagon by individual Vietnamese, but that most were funneled through an American researcher working in Hanoi, ostensibly on a book about the Vietnamese Army.  Officials said that the researcher, Theodore Schweitzer, had come to them offering to share information that he could not get published elsewhere. The Pentagon agreed to pay his expenses and provide him with a computer and other assistance.  Mr. Schweitzer began work in February or March. But it was not until the summer that the Pentagon became aware of the importance of the material being collected, and the role of Vietnamese officials, who were apparently placing pictures, documents and artifacts at the American's disposal.  Pentagon officials stress that the photograph cache poses countless new questions and suggests many new leads for further research. They are eager to test Vietnamese promises of more archival material. Among the pictures are hundreds of copied identification cards and newspaper clippings, demonstrating how meticulously Hanoi kept files on the Americans.  No Evidence of Living Prisoners  So far, officials said, there have been no indications in the new material that living Americans remained in captivity after prisoner exchanges in 1973. Of 135 ""discrepancy cases"" presented to Vietnam over the last several years as the easiest to resolve, 2 have been effectively closed through photographic evidence, and the families of a fighter crew shot down in 1968 -- Maj. Joseph C. Morrison and Capt. San D. Francisco -- have been notified. A third family has also been shown pictures, but officials would not identify the case.  Major Morrison's daughter, Cindy, said tonight in an interview with ABC News that the Pentagon showed her family the pictures last month.  ""We know for sure that he is dead, and that is a relief,"" she said.  American officials say Hanoi's decision to give up archival material was motivated by economic and strategic concerns. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a former prisoner of war, who accompanied General Vessey to Hanoi, told reporters that the Vietnamese ""are desperate for economic assistance.""  The United States now blocks aid to Vietnam from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. An Administration official said that this kind of assistance -- allowing large and badly needed public projects like roads, airports, power plants or ports to be constructed -- is needed if Hanoi is to be able to complete its ambitious plans for economic development.

"    Barbara Cleary O'Connor wants to know precisely what happened 20 years ago when her husband disappeared without a trace over Hanoi during the final few minutes of what was to have been his last mission as an Air Force pilot.  ""Was he hit by anti-aircraft fire? she said yesterday from Wayland, Mass., where she lives with her second husband. ""Did he eject? I know it sounds gruesome to want all the details, but I do. In that 15 minutes, I want to know exactly what happened.""  Mrs. O'Connor's son, Sean Cleary, had a somewhat different wish as he digested the news, announced yesterday by President Bush, that the Vietnamese Government has pledged to release all photographs, documents and other information relating to the 2,265 Americans still listed as unaccounted for in Indochina.  ""We would like to be handed my father's body so he can be buried on American soil,"" said Mr. Cleary, 24 years old, an assistant basketball coach at Manhattan College in New York City. ""And at Arlington National Cemetery, which was my father's wish.""  Ulterior Motives Suspected  The Cleary family, and others like them across the country, alternated between hope and skepticism yesterday, confident that the events of recent days were in fact a breakthrough in their two-decade nightmare of uncertainty but wary of trusting the Vietnamese Government, which had disappointed them before.  ""There's no question this is a big move,"" Mrs. O'Connor said. ""But they have made promises in the past and not kept them. After 20 years, it would be ridiculous not to have some hesitation.""  A few families were not merely skeptical but also persuaded that the Vietnamese Government and the Bush Administration had ulterior motives. In that category is Kate Rothacker of Mission Viejo, Calif., who is convinced that her brother, shot down during a secret Air Force mission, is alive in a Laotian prison camp.  According to Ms. Rothacker's scenario, the Vietnamese Government, eager for trade with the United States and aware of Mr. Bush's dismal election prospects, is offering only a portion of what it knows.  ""My worry is that this will give the country a sense of closure without looking to other hiding places,"" she said.  While some families cling to hope that their loved ones are still alive and held captive, far more seem certain that they died instantly or shortly thereafter. But that conviction does not still the need for formal notification of death, for irrefutable facts and, most of all, for remains that they can lay to rest.  ""What I need is the period at the end of the sentence,"" said Jeff Hudgens, 28, who works for an electronics company in San Jose, Calif., and barely remembers his father, Maj. Edward M. Hudgens, shot down on a search and rescue mission over Laos in 1970. ""Myself, personally, I have no doubt he's dead. But I don't have that final proof, O.K., 'Here's the remains,' or, 'Here's a picture of what happened.' Something to know. Now we don't know, we just think.""  No Reunion Illusions  Sean Cleary, too, holds out virtually no hope for his father, but needs the case closed definitively.  ""I'm 99.9 percent sure,"" he said. ""But as long as there's that .1 percent -- it's human nature.""  With a guilty stammer, Mr. Cleary said that ""to be completely honest,"" he does not even wish that his father were alive.  ""Some people, you say that, and they're taken aback,"" he said. ""But what he would have had to live through, I don't want that.""  His sentiments were shared by several wives of missing servicemen, some of them remarried and thus alarmed at the prospect, however far-fetched, that their first husbands might be alive, and others reconciled to their lives as widows and without illusion about what such a reunion might be like after all these years.  ""It would be living hell,"" said Mary Lynn Tuft of Auburn, Calif., who was married to her first husband, Thomas E. Pettit, for less than two years when his helicopter disappeared off the radar screen in 1967.  While Mrs. Tuft quickly remarried, and had a son who is now 21 years old, she has remained in close touch with her grieving in-laws. It is for their sake that she hopes the archives yield information about her first husband.  Pentagon officials said yesterday that three families had so far been shown photographs from the nearly 5,000 already turned over by the Hanoi Government. According to the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, a Washington lobbying group, two of those families are the next of kin of Maj. Joseph C. Morrison and Capt. San D. Francisco, Air Force pilots whose F-4D fighter plane was shot down over North Vietnam in 1968.  The Pentagon would not identify the third family and the league said it did not know.  LOAD-DATE: October 24, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photos: Capt.

"    The announcement last week of Vietnam's pledge to release all photographs and other archival material on missing American servicemen illustrates the new dynamics of the post-cold war era, as well as the old dynamics of American politics.  President Bush said the Vietnamese move -- confirmed in a mission to Hanoi last weekend led by retired Gen. John Vessey -- was a breakthrough, but ""only a beginning"" toward normalizing relations and ending the trade embargo of Vietnam.  His announcement had the unmistakable feel of domestic politicking, not least because Hanoi's new openness is actually months old.  It has already quietly released nearly 5,000 photos of dead Americans, former prisoners, crash sites and the like -- the bulk of them duplicates, but some resolving a few M.I.A. cases.  The new flow of material is largely thanks to the go-between efforts of a historical researcher, Ted Schweitzer, whose successful private forays into Vietnamese military museums led to his being hired by the Pentagon as a consultant. General Vessey in Hanoi exacted an explicit pledge to formalize the working arrangement already under way.  Both sides have much to gain. Vietnam, no longer Soviet-backed, needs outside help to modernize the country, but Washington is blocking loans. The United States wants to outflank Japan, which is about to break ranks and offer Hanoi aid. American companies don't want to lose out on what could be a new Asian tiger.

"      At the center of a major breakthrough in American efforts to resolve cases of servicemen missing since the Vietnam War is an American researcher who served as a conduit for Hanoi and was paid by the Pentagon as a consultant.  Those who know the researcher, Theodore Schweitzer, say they are not surprised that a man they describe as an adventurer should be identified this week as the principal link in the transfer to Washington of a trove of Vietnamese photographs and documents on American servicemen.  That windfall of material and Hanoi's pledge to turn over all documents, pictures and personal effect relating to American servicemen led President Bush to announce on Friday that the United States could begin to write ""the last chapter of the Vietnam War,"" an accounting that Administration officials say could lead to a normalization of relations after 20 bitter years in which Vietnam repeatedly denied it had any more information on the missing.  But Mr. Schweitzer, working in Hanoi's military museum archives since February, uncovered and passed on to Washington, apparently with Vietnamese Government approval, enough material to significantly speed up the resolution of many cases of missing Americans.  'Old Indochina Hand'  The 50-year-old Mr. Schweitzer, who has spent much of his adult life in Southeast Asia or on projects involving Vietnam, has been working in Hanoi since February or March on a book about the Vietnamese Army. Officials say he made contact with the Pentagon and offered to share information that he could not get published elsewhere.  Pentagon officials call him a valuable consultant whom they have supplied with computers and an expense account. They describe him as an ""old Indochina hand"" who happened to be in the right place at the right time, and say they have no qualms about the authenticity of the material they are receiving.  In interviews with representatives of international organizations or government agencies that knew of his work, others offered differing accounts of Mr. Schweitzer's activities in southeast Asia over more than a decade, but they declined to be quoted directly. They wondered how he gained the confidence of Hanoi, where few American scholars get open-ended privileges to work.  Many of his former associates also declined to speak for the record about Mr. Schweitzer, who appeared at the Pentagon and the White House Rose Garden this week. The Pentagon, which coordinated all queries about him, declined requests for interviews with Mr. Schweitzer, although he did appear briefly on an ABC News broadcast Friday, speaking only about his work in Hanoi.  Campaign for Medicines  Over the years, he has told of undercover intelligence missions in Vietnam during the war and of an assignment to burn American Embassy records in Phnom Penh in the face of the advancing Khmer Rouge. Government intelligence agencies will not comment on agents and operations as matter of policy. But the Pentagon said this week that it did not know of him until he approached officials this year through intermediaries.  The Vietnamese knew him as the head of an independent campaign in the 1980's to supply medicines to the country, for which they were grateful. Born in Missouri, Mr. Schweitzer married a Thai and worked in the early 1980's in the southern Thai port of Songkhla for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  In an interview with an Italian television network in 1988, Mr. Schweitzer left the impression that he was still working for the refugee group. In fact, he had left the agency more than seven years earlier.  He did receive commendations from the United Nations organization for risking his life to save Vietnamese boat people from pirates. But officials working in Thailand at the time said that he had ""embroidered"" the facts in recounting his exploits on behalf of Vietnamese boat people for a ""Drama in Real Life"" article in Reader's Digest in January 1986.                               --------------------   Hanoi Urges Normal U.S. Ties  HANOI, Vietnam, Oct. 24 (Reuters) -- The Vietnamese Government urged the United States today to normalize diplomatic relations and stop linking such ties to a resolution of the fate of American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War.

"    Confronted with evidence that its secret archives could shed light on the fate of Americans missing since the Vietnam War, Hanoi has finally opened those records. The Bush Administration can best reciprocate with two overdue steps of its own: Lift the U.S. veto on international bank lending to Vietnam, and establish diplomatic ties.  America's punitive policies toward Vietnam have done little to advance U.S. interests. Successive Administrations barred Americans from most commerce with Hanoi and pressed allies for similar restrictions. This boycott isolated Vietnam from the democratic ferment fostered by foreign trade and investment in Eastern Europe and China.  Hanoi blames America for this isolation. But Hanoi's own perverse behavior is as much to blame.  Vietnam might have achieved normalization in the Carter years. Instead it demanded billions in reconstruction aid, not acknowledging its own brazen violations of the Paris peace agreements. Although Hanoi can claim some justification for invading Pol Pot's Cambodia in 1978, it can claim none for a 10-year occupation. And its long insistence that it was fully cooperating in the search for missing Americans now stands exposed as a lie.  Still, if Hanoi opens its archives the case for ending the boycott is strong. Vietnam now welcomes foreign investment and private entrepreneurship. It makes no sense to undermine those reforms by blocking World Bank loans, or to handicap U.S. businesses interested in this new market.  The case for diplomatic ties is also compelling. New political and economic channels can increase opportunities for raising issues that concern Americans. If both sides pursue this opening, the much-delayed Vietnam peace may finally be at hand.

"      A Vietnamese-speaking Russian named Irina Zisman is now touring the United States to the applause of Vietnamese-Americans and the consternation of Hanoi. Ms. Zisman recently began a prime-time evening broadcast on Radio Moscow that beams pro-democracy messages to Vietnam through the same powerful Siberian transmitters that once relayed programs on the glories of Communism.  Hanoi's stunned officials have branded the broadcasts subversive, but their protests to Moscow have been unavailing. For them, the experience has been a painful illustration of how the world has changed; it also offers a clue to Hanoi's motives in pledging, after 20 years of obfuscation, to finally reveal what it knows about Americans unaccounted for in Indochina since the war.  Without weakening in any way its absolute commitment to Communism, Administration officials say, Vietnam is signaling that it realizes there may never be a better chance to win American diplomatic recognition and unlock international economic assistance that Washington has blocked. Withholding information is no longer a workable policy for Vietnam, which remains disastrously underdeveloped by Asian standards and is now running into trouble with both Moscow and Beijing.  There is also some added reason to move fast. For years the Bush Administration has told Vietnam it could obtain normal relations with the United States in return for cooperation in ending the Cambodian civil war and better accounting for American servicemen missing in Indochina. Now, tantalizingly close to the end of that road, Hanoi cannot be sure that a new Congress or perhaps a Democratic Administration will not revise the road map by raising additional issues of political pluralism and human rights. Such a course is advocated by Vietnamese-American organizations and some politicians in both major parties. And if Bill Clinton wins the Presidency it is far from certain that recognizing Vietnam would get high priority in any event.  Internationally, Vietnam has not only lost its political, economic and military lifelines to the former Soviet bloc, but it has also been thrown into renewed confrontation with China, with the latest friction points being conflicting claims to offshore islands in the South China Sea and the activities of smugglers. ""Vietnam has become totally isolated strategically,"" said Robert S. Ross, an assistant professor of political science at Boston College who has recently returned from five months in China. ""The Chinese are now trying to extract Vietnamese humility in many ways.""  ""It was the Soviets who basically allowed the Vietnamese to defy China,"" said Mr. Ross, referring to the period in the 1970's when Leonid I. Brezhnev supported Vietnam even at the expense of Soviet-Chinese relations. Mikhail S. Gorbachev reversed the policy, and after the Chinese-Soviet summit meeting in 1989 Vietnam was cut adrift. ""It had little alternative but to accommodate itself to Chinese authority,"" Mr. Ross said.  Pressure From U.S. Companies  Dependence on China did not contribute much to Vietnam's economic development beyond some increased trade, however, and now Bush Administration officials are being pressed by American oil companies and other industries eager to do business with Vietnam. Administration analysts think Hanoi would be receptive, and say they don't believe Hanoi wants to trade dependence on China for dominance by Japan in its search for economic partners. Such a message was apparently transmitted between the lines in recent talks between Vietnam's leaders and an American delegation led by President Bush's special envoy, John W. Vessey Jr.  ""There is concern about both Japan and China throughout Southeast Asia,"" said Evelyn Colbert, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the region. But she said some analysts overestimate how much the fear of China is a motive for Vietnam's developing openness with the United States. She said the Vietnamese ""woke up and saw that their economic system wasn't functioning"" and may simply have come to realize that to improve their economy they would have to change their relationship with the United States. And that, of course, would have to start with a certain amount of candor about the missing servicemen.  ""I like to think that Vietnam's cooperation has something to do with those of us who in one form or another have been telling them over and over and over again, you've got to do something about this issue if you want to get normalization,"" said Ms. Colbert. ""They were told by many people, including their friends, that this demand may be unreasonable, but you have this bad public image because of it.""  John McAuliff, executive director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, an organization that has been forging private links to Vietnam, says the Bush Administration has also shown a change of approach, ""sending a signal to Vietnam that they are serious about solving the problem without recrimination."" In addition, the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs and the Pentagon played a part by narrowing the number of cases on which the Vietnamese could reasonably be expected to provide information.  ""This is something the Vietnamese can respond to,"" Mr. McAuliff said, but he added that Washington must seize the moment too. ""We would hope that once the election is over,"" he said, ""whoever is elected could use the interregnum period for responding appropriately to the Vietnamese, to the legitimate pressures from American business and to pressure from our allies to cease using trade and the lending organizations as clubs to hit the Vietnamese for political reasons.""

"      In months of analyzing hundreds of Vietnamese archival photographs, the Pentagon has been able to resolve with any certainty only four new cases of Americans unaccounted for since the war.  In all cases, the servicemen have been confirmed dead, officials said, and the families have been told. Analysts are close to identifying at least another three others, according to the Pentagon, but the photographs have yielded more clues than conclusions.  Pentagon officials said that so far none of the material had indicated that any Americans survived the war in captivity.  Working at the headquarters of the Defense Intelligence Agency in Arlington, Va., a team is trying to identify some of the more than 2,260 Americans the United States says are unaccounted for. More than half are known to have died, but their bodies have not been recovered. There are varying degrees of information, some of it contradictory, about the rest.  American Team to Vietnam  A team of American archivists and analysts went to Vietnam this weekend to take Hanoi up on its offer of greater access to records concerning Americans captured or killed during the war.  Accompanying the team, officials said, was Theodore Schweitzer, the American researcher and Pentagon consultant through whom much of the new archival material was funneled over the last year.  On Friday, in another demonstration of greater cooperation with the United States, the Vietnamese allowed another group of Pentagon officials to visit the secret headquarters in southwestern Vietnam from which Hanoi ran its war in what was then South Vietnam.  The leading Communists at the headquarters, near the Cambodian border in Tay Ninh Province, once included Nguyen Van Linh, later Secretary General of the Communist Party, and Vo Van Kiet, who is now Prime Minister.  Breakdown of Photographs  At a recent briefing for reporters, Pentagon officials supplied a breakdown of the new archival material. In studying the 4,800 photographs, officials said they eliminated duplicates, leaving about 1,800 images. Of these, 600 were identified as copies of photographs the Pentagon had already collected since American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1973.  Officials say that the 1,100 to 1,200 remaining photographs include copies of identification cards and newspaper clippings. The Pentagon said these prove how meticulously the Vietnamese kept records on Americans.  Of the photographs already analyzed, 178 were of people alive in captivity at the time, 160 of whom have been identified as known prisoners. All but two came home in prisoner exchanges. Two died in captivity, and their remains were returned.  There are 63 photographs of bodies or body parts, containing 31 individuals. Twenty-three of them have been tentatively identified. Five were on the missing list, and six on the list of men known to have been killed but whose bodies have not been recovered. Twelve were of servicemen whose remains have been returned. Eight are still being studied.  The wealth of clues provokes questions about whether the ""discrepancy list"" of cases judged to be the most easily resolvable in Hanoi should be maintained.  Mary Backley, director of operations for the National League of Families of P.O.W.s-M.I.As, said the organization had always opposed the list.  ""We don't want to narrow the universe to the extent that it would provide an out for the Vietnamese,"" she said. ""The archives have the potential to account for many more Americans.""  A Defense Department official said that there may be many more than the 135 discrepancy list cases that could be resolved, based on the new material. Other officials in the Pentagon and State Department, believe that insufficient attention is often given to cases that may be compelling, but do not appear on the priority list presented to the Vietnamese.

"   , Vietnam, Nov. 14   Up a musty stairwell in a museum commemorating the triumphs of the People's Army of Vietnam, a team of American investigators sit hunched over laptop computers and a camera tripod, trying to end what for many American families is the continuing torment of the Vietnam War.  Every half hour or so, a group of Vietnamese museum workers slowly make their way up the steps, lugging another assortment of relics collected from the enemy, the United States, in that long-ago war.  The relics examined by the Pentagon investigators one morning this week included an American-issue military parachute, a pocket flare gun, an airman's helmet with the wearer's name on it, a blue-felt Air Force captain's cap, a plastic flap from the fuel tank of an American military jet, a single pink cotton handkerchief and a pair of red-and-white socks -- all of it hidden away for years in unlit storerooms in the Museum of the People's Army, the national war museum in Hanoi.  2,265 Still Missing  This, the American investigators say, is what they have been waiting for.  If they are correct, these bits and pieces of metal, rubber and cloth -- along with thousands of black-and-white photographs stored elsewhere in the museum -- will allow the United States to determine the fate of many of the 2,265 Americans who are still officially listed as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.  It was only last month, after an American researcher alerted the Pentagon to the treasure trove in the museum, that the Hanoi Government agreed to allow a Defense Department team to come in to study the full collection.  Breakthrough Is Seen  The commander of the American investigators now working in Vietnam, Lieut. Col. Jack Donovan, described Vietnam's new open-access decree as a breakthrough.  ""I've heard this described as the central biggest development since 1973 in terms of accounting for missing Americans,"" he said. It was in 1973 that United States ground forces pulled out of Vietnam.  Until last week, Americans investigators had only guessed at what might be found in the war museum, three blocks from Ho Chi Minh's mausolem in the heart of the Vietnamese capital. Only a small fraction of the articles were actually on public display in the museum, which draws a steady stream of visitors. Now they know it contains personal items and military gear taken from scores, and perhaps hundreds, of American soldiers, pilots and sailors who were captured or killed in North Vietnamese territory.  ""My gut feeling is that our work is going to be very valuable,"" said James Minihan, a 26-year-old Navy petty officer from Jacksonville, N.C., who spends his days at the museum tapping away on the keyboard of a laptop computer, cataloging the relics as they are placed on the floor on a white sheet of paper and photographed. ""The Vietnamese have kept very complete records on this material.""  Vietnam is eager for normal diplomatic relations with the United States and is desperate for Washington to lift the economic embargo it has imposed since the end of the war. Since 1988, it has allowed Pentagon investigators into the country to search for the remains of Americans missing from the war. The Defense Department opened an office in Hanoi last year.  No Single Depository  There is no single repository in Vietnam for wartime army records and artifacts gathered from American soldiers. Instead, records and relics are scattered throughout the country in dozens of war museums and archives, some built by individual provinces and cities to commemorate their local contribution to the war against the Americans and, earlier, against the French.  The Americans, who until last month had been granted access to only a few museums and archives in Vietnam, are now discovering how meticulous the Vietnamese record-keeping was.  In the Army Museum in Hanoi, the well-preserved relics range from military penknives and wristwatches to bicycle-sized chunks of jagged metal from the wings of B-52 bombers shot down over North Vietnamese territory. Virtually all of the items inspected so far have been carefully tagged to show where and when they were found.  The artifacts may help the Pentagon determine exactly where individual soldiers died and how, or where American planes went down and whether their pilots survived. That in turn will help American search teams decide which areas of the Vietnamese countryside should be combed for human remains.  'Pieces of the Puzzle'  ""The end result of work does not take place here in Hanoi,"" said Chief Warrant Officer Gary Fulton of West Des Moines, another of the investigators working at the museum. ""We're getting pieces of the puzzle that will take us back out into the field.""  As he spoke, a Vietnamese museum worker carefully laid an American aviator's helmet on the paper-covered floor so it could be photographed from several different angles.  ""That could be valuable,"" said Chief Fulton, motioning to a small, worn name tag that had been affixed to the outside of the helmet, apparently by the airmen who had once worn it. Mr. Fulton showed the helmet to a reporter on condition that the name not be used.  Some of the relics inspected by the investigators will be of no use in determining the fate of missing Americans.  They were taken from prisoners of war who were freed by the Vietnamese years ago, or they are so innocuous that it will be impossible to link them to any one person.  ""We were given a brown leather wallet -- empty, no identification, no pictures inside,"" said Petty Officer Eric Frandsen, 28, of Lansing, Mich., the team's photographer. ""I photographed it. I don't know how valuable something like that would be.""  Many Bear Identification  But many other artifacts turned over so far by the Vietnamese do bear a name, a serial number or some other notation that could help American investigators tie them to a missing soldier or pilot, or to a particular battle, crash or ambush.  The Pentagon team has inspected American-issue military parachutes and life vests in recent days that, while they have no name tags, are stamped with a series of inspection dates, which should make it possible to determine with some accuracy when the survival equipment was used by a serviceman.  The names and other details can be checked against information stored in the laptop computers carried by the American investigators. The computers hold a detailed electronic dossier on each of the 2,265 Americans -- 2,262 men, 3 women -- who remain missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Of these the vast majority are assumed to have been killed in combat, and are listed as missing because circumstantial evidence of death has yet to be backed up with physical proof.  The Pentagon investigators are still in the very early stages of their work, and they are reluctant to guess how long the inspections in Hanoi and elsewhere in the country will take.  Wary of Raising Hopes  They are even more reluctant to estimate how many of the 2,265 cases of missing Americans might be solved by their work. They say their optimism, which is palpable here, might raise false hopes among the families of the missing,  ""This work is going to help us answer questions concerning the fate of a number of missing Americans,"" said Robert J. Destatte, a Defense Intelligence Agency analyst whose career has been dedicated since 1979 to the search for missing Americans. ""I'm confident we're moving in the right direction. But it's going to be a long process.""  Some of his colleagues say the search for missing Americans is likely to continue for years.  The Vietnamese Government has already provided the Bush Administration with the thousands of photographs of dead Americans taken by Vietnamese military photographers during the war and stored in the People's Army Museum.  Librarian Was the Key  The exact sequence of events that led Hanoi to turn over the photographs and to announce last month that it would grant the Pentagon full access to the war archives remains a mystery, although it is one clearly linked to the unusual relationship between the Vietnamese Government and an American researcher, Ted Schweitzer, who was given access to photographic archives at the Army Museum earlier this year.  According to the Vietnamese, Mr. Schweitzer, a 50-year-old librarian, was allowed to rummage through the museum's collection after he told museum directors that he was writing a book about the war. Vietnamese officials say they were later surprised and irritated when he turned over the results of his research to the Pentagon.  During a search of the archives, Mr. Schweitzer found thousands of photos of American servicemen who had been captured or killed by the Vietnamese. Last summer, after telling associates that he had failed to interest New York publishers in a book, Mr. Schweitzer turned the photographs over to the Defense Department.  Mr. Schweitzer is now back in Hanoi, this time as a Pentagon consultant. But the other American investigators here say they rarely see him and know almost nothing about him. He did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.  Hiding Material Denied  Mr. Schweitzer's disclosure of the photos raised new questions about whether Hanoi has been hiding information that might have resolved the fate of missing Americans years ago.  Le Van Bang, director of American affairs at the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, said that material in the museums had always been available to the United States, but that Pentagon investigators had chosen to conduct their investigation on a case-by-case basis -- requesting information about a specific soldiers instead of requesting access to everything in the museum archives. ""We were not hiding anything,"" he said.  But Pentagon investigators working in Vietnam say the recent disclosures prove that they have been misled for years by the Vietnamese. They add, however, that the new Vietnamese pledge of cooperation is so important that there is nothing to be gained by attacking the Vietnamese publicly.  ""If there was a misunderstanding with the Vietnamese, it is not so important now as the fact that we have an agreement that pleases everybody,"" Mr. Destatte said. ""Certainly it pleases everybody on our side.""

"   , Vietnam, Nov. 16   Members of a Senate panel investigating the fate of Americans missing from the Vietnam War hailed what they said today was a new spirit of cooperation from Vietnam and suggested strongly that President Bush might soon relax an economic embargo against the Hanoi Government.  The comments by the senators followed a meeting in Hanoi with a senior official who pledged that Vietnam would provide ""the clearest possible answers"" to questions about the 2,265 Americans still unaccounted for.  ""We are at a critical juncture,"" said Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and Vietnam veteran who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs. ""We are definitely on a road leading to normalization.  ""It's my sense that the President may be in a position, if we get adequate cooperation and if we can speed this process up, to make positive moves with respect to the embargo. I think that the Government of Vietnam has made a decision to help us get answers.""  Letter From Bush  The embargo has barred United States investment in Vietnam, has discouraged other foreign investment and has prevented the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other large international financial institutions from assisting Hanoi in rebuilding an economy that is only now beginning to recover from the war.  Senator Kerry said he was carrying a letter from President Bush to President Le Duc Anh. The Senator said he believed it was the first direct communication from a United States President to his Vietnamese counterpart since the fall of South Vietnam in 1975.  While Senator Kerry did not make the contents public, Congressional officials said they understood the letter made clear that President Bush, in his final weeks in office, was willing to move quickly to improve relations in exchange for further cooperation on the question of missing Americans.  Senator Hank Brown of Colorado, the Republican on the three-member delegation, said that ""if there is a perception that we have had positive meetings this week, then you'll see the White House act"" on the embargo.  The Pain of the Embargo  Vietnam is eager to begin normal diplomatic relations with the United States and is desperate to see Washington lift the embargo, which was imposed against the North Vietnamese Government in 1964 and against all of Vietnam in 1975.  The Vietnamese are aware that they are operating against the clock -- specifically, they want Washington to lift the embargo before the transfer of power in the White House in January.  Vietnamese officials say their best of hope of ending the embargo quickly rests with President Bush, since President-elect Bill Clinton has already told veterans' groups that he feels no pressure to improve relations with Vietnam while there are unanswered questions about the fate of missing Americans.  Last month Hanoi announced that it would provide Defense Department investigators with full access to military museums and war archives.  Senate Report Due Soon  Defense Department officials have described the announcement as a breakthrough in their efforts to determine what became of the Americans. The museums and archives are believed to hold thousands of artifacts collected from Americans -- as well as photographs of some of them -- after they were captured or killed in territory held by North Vietnamese forces.  Senator Kerry, Senator Brown and Senator Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, are representing the committee on a five-day tour of South Vietnam and Laos, the panel's last scheduled trip to Southeast Asia before it completes its work at the end of the year and submits a final report.  The Senators are expected to meet Tuesday with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, and to tour military installations in Hanoi where Americans were once rumored to have been held.  In a meeting today with the senators, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai pledged that ""any request, any question you raise, we will give the clearest possible answers.""  20 Years Is 'Long Enough'  ""It has been 20 years now since the end of the war,"" he said. ""That is long enough. That is why we should accelerate our cooperation.""  The Senators also met with the senior officials directly involved in assisting the Pentagon in searching for information about missing Americans.  Although the meeting did not resolve the fate of any of the Americans unaccounted for, Senator Kerry said the spirit of conciliation may signal an important shift in Hanoi's policies. It was the first time the Vietnamese had opened such a meeting to reporters.  ""This is the first time we've ever had a discussion in the open like this -- about substantive cases, about real facts,"" Senator Kerry said.

"   , Vietnam, Nov. 17   Three Senators and a group of Pentagon officials were allowed today to tour long-secret areas of Vietnam's military headquarters and to rummage through a storeroom of museum artifacts that could hold clues to the fate of Americans missing from the Vietnam War.  The visits were evidence of what Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet of Vietnam described today as his nation's determination to ""resolve all aspects of the issue of missing Americans"" and to establish full diplomatic and economic ties with the United States.  In the dank storeroom in Hanoi's central war museum, Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on M.I.A.-P.O.W. affairs, opened a dust-covered wooden closet and found stacks of neatly folded olive green flight suits that, according to the Vietnamese, had been worn by American airmen shot down over North Vietnamese territory.  Defense Department investigators had not been granted access to the storeroom until today, and they appeared startled by Senator Kerry's discovery.  Hanoi's 'Enormous Effort'  At least some of the flight suits bore name tags and, according to investigators, could provide the United States with important evidence in trying to determine the fate of pilots and other airmen who are among the 2,265 Americans still listed as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.  After touring the museum, Maj. Gen. Thomas G. Needham, who oversees Pentagon teams investigating the fate of missing Americans throughout Indochina, said that Vietnamese cooperation ""has markedly increased almost every day."" ""We've no reason to believe that we're not getting the information we want,"" he said.  Senator Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican who is a member of the select committee, said today in Hanoi that he detected an ""enormous effort by Vietnam to change -- to work toward friendship, to work toward cooperation.""  The three Senators -- Mr. Brown, Mr. Kerry and Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat who is also a member of the committee -- are making the panel's last scheduled visit to Vietnam before the committee is to complete a final report and go out of business in January after a 17-month investigation.  Tour of the Citadel  The report is expected to judge the quality of Vietnamese cooperation in resolving the question of Americans missing from the war. The Senators hinted this week that President Bush, as one of his final acts in the White House, will relax a 17-year American trade embargo that has discouraged foreign investments in Vietnam.  Calls by Americans to relax the embargo have accelerated since Vietnam's announcement last month that it would allow American investigators full access to military museums and archives holding information about Americans.  Today's visit to the Hanoi war museum, the Museum of the People's Army, came after the three Senators and a team of Pentagon officials toured the Citadel, a complex of buildings that serves as Vietnam's military headquarters.  Over the years, American intelligence reports gathered from Vietnamese refugees have suggested that American prisoners might have been held in the Citadel long after the end of the Vietnam War. But Senator Kerry said after touring the building that ""we found significant information"" discounting at least one such report, asserting that a group of about 30 Caucasian men was seen there in 1986.   Senator Is Impressed  Vietnamese officials, hopeful that President Bush will relax and perhaps even lift the economic embargo before he leaves office in January, appeared anxious today to convince the Senators and Pentagon officials that Hanoi was cooperating fully in the search for missing Americans.  Senator Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, said he was very impressed with the Vietnamese efforts.  ""I think the cooperation, at least in the couple of of days we've been here, has been as much as we can ask for,"" he said. ""Everything we've asked for has been done.""  The Senators also met today with Prime Minister Kiet, who later told reporters that American and Vietnamese officials ""understand each other very clearly and well.""  Senator Kerry was presented by the museum's director, Col. Pham Duc Dai, with several wartime artifacts and documents, including a handful of Social Security cards and one identification card that had been collected from captured or killed American soldiers.  The Senators were given a blue and gold airman's helmet that, the Vietnamese said, had been worn by Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who is a member of the select committee and who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for more than five years. Inside the helmet were the initials ""J. M.""  ""I would think there must be piles of this stuff elsewhere,"" Senator Kerry said, pointing to the other wartime relics that were turned over to the American delegation today: items of military clothing, what appeared to be an American pilot's charred log book, a handbook titled ""Survival"" on American military search and rescue techniques.

"   , Vietnam, Nov. 18   Documents and wartime artifacts released this week by the Vietnamese Government have allowed American investigators to determine that four soldiers listed as missing from the Vietnam War did in fact die, the chairman of a Senate investigating panel said today.  The soldiers were apparently killed in an ambush by North Vietnamese forces in July 1967 in the central province of Quang Ngai.  Their fate was unclear until this week, when an aging Vietnamese colonel provided the panel with his 1967 war diary, which described the ambush and the effort by local villagers to hide the bodies of the four soldiers from American search-and-rescue teams.  'We Know What Happened'  ""At least in our judgment, we believe we can say we know what happened,"" said Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs. ""We believe they died, although we don't have their remains yet."" The names of the four soldiers were not released.  ""In addition to those four people, I've been informed that there are answers as to other people,"" he added.  At a news conference here, Senator Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, said extensive new cooperation from the Vietnamese Government in resolving the fate of missing Americans must be met with a gesture by the United States, which has maintained a crippling trade embargo on Hanoi since the end of the war.  Vietnamese cooperation has been ""significant,"" the Senator said, ""and I think the United States needs to recognize that significance.""  ""Those of us who are on this trip are strongly inclined to urge the President to take certain actions,"" he said. ""This cannot be a one-way street. I think it would be inappropriate of the United States not to act.""  Senator Kerry has suggested strongly that President Bush is on the verge of relaxing the embargo.  He said today that the cooperation provided by Vietnam in recent days led him to think that President Bush need not wait to act until after the committee has released its report. ""It's my sense that if the President believes cooperation has been forthcoming,"" he said, ""I don't think he would necessarily wait.""  Senator Kerry, whose committee is supposed to complete its work before early January and then file a report, said he would encourage the Defense Department to revise its standards for resolving the status of the 2,265 Americans who are still officially listed as missing.  He and the two Senators traveling with him, Hank Brown, a Colorado Republican, and Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, have suggested that the standards are unrealistic because they allow resolution of a case only if the body of a missing American is found or if the missing person is found alive. In many cases, investigators say, remains will never be recovered.  ""We are going to have to talk to the Secretary of Defense about this whole category of standards,"" he said. ""There are 2,265 cases, but in point of fact we know that about 450 of the losses were over water. We know that another significant number are incidents in which there was such an explosion that there was nothing left.""  The Colonel's Diary  On Tuesday the senators were presented with war artifacts that appeared to hold clues to the fate of missing Americans.  The diary was presented to Senator Kerry by Col. Pham Duc Dai, director of all Vietnamese military museums, who said he saw the 1967 ambush in which the four soldiers were killed.  ""I saw the ambush and all four soldiers were killed right then,"" the colonel said. ""Fifteen minutes after, American helicopters were flying very near, trying to find them. So the children came out and they laid on the bodies of the dead soldiers -- covered the bodies of the soldiers with their own bodies -- so that the helicopter pilots could not find them.""  Colonel Dai said the bodies were never found because they were placed in a nearby river and weighted down with rocks.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   A generation ago, the Vietnamese learned how American public opinion could help end a war that bullets and bombs and the sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of lives seemed incapable of drawing to a close.  Now they are trying to apply that lesson in reviving a peacetime economy that remains among the most backward in Asia -- backward in no small part because of a 17-year-old trade embargo that is one of the last vestiges of the Vietnam war.  The Vietnamese want the embargo lifted. And this time, on the battlefield of public relations, Hanoi enjoys the support of former adversaries in the American Government and business establishment; many there think it is time to normalize relations. This time, Hanoi's leaders know, it is elements of the American public who must be persuaded.  The Vietnamese say their decision last month to open up war museums and military archives to inspection by the United States Government was entirely a humanitarian gesture intended to help the Defense Department determine what happened to 2,265 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina.  But as they met with a delegation of senators and Pentagon officials who traveled to Vietnam last week to discuss the search for the missing, Vietnamese leaders pressed hard for the Americans to urge President Bush to lift the trade embargo before he leaves the White House in January.  Vietnamese officials don't deny that they sometimes choreograph events with an American audience in mind.  The most poignant moment for the Senate delegation came at Hanoi's central military museum, as an aging Vietnamese army colonel, surrounded by American television cameras, turned over memorabilia taken from American soldiers during the war: prayer booklets, high school identification cards, family photographs, as well as the airman's helmet worn by Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who spent five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.  The colonel also gave the senators his wartime diary, which appeared to hold answers to the disappearance of four American soldiers in a central Vietnamese province in 1967. The diary says the soldiers were ambushed, their bodies hidden from rescue teams.  What has gone largely unmentioned in the excitement over the archival treasure trove is that the Vietnamese, after years of saying they were cooperating fully in the search for missing Americans, are making this material public only now.  Adventurer in the Archives  Diplomats in Hanoi and American officials offer no single theory about why Hanoi took so long to open the archives and why the first of the artifacts were given months ago to an American adventurer, Ted Schweitzer, instead of to Defense Department investigators.  According to accounts from American officials, Mr. Schweitzer received permission from Hanoi's central war museum to go through its archives for material on a book on the war. Mr. Schweitzer came across thousands of black and white photographs of Americans captured or killed during the war. He turned the photos over to the Pentagon, apparently with the knowledge of at least some elements of the Vietnamese Army.  ""Vietnam has a factionalized, bureaucratic Government,"" said an Asian diplomat, ""I think one faction within the military wanted to hold on to this material while another faction wanted to get the photos out in time for President Bush to lift the embargo. They saw Schweitzer as a means of getting around official channels."" Another theory says the Vietnamese just didn't realize the value of the photos until Mr. Schweitzer saw them.  Whatever the explanation, the Bush Administration, Congress and American business leaders seem eager to use Vietnam's full-access pledge to ease the American economic embargo imposed after South Vietnam fell in 1975. In a letter last week to President Le Duc Anh, President Bush hinted strongly that he would relax the embargo in exchange for continued cooperation.  Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and Vietnam veteran who is the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, said it would be counterproductive now to protest over Vietnam's long delay. ""If we shut down our investigation because we get angry about what we didn't get in the past, we deny our families the answers they want,"" he said.  American investigators say they, too, have no desire to feud with the Vietnamese. ""We're delighted with this new cooperation,"" said Lieut. Col. Jack Donovan, the senior Defense Department investigator now in Vietnam. ""I'm too busy to be angry about the past.""  The Vietnamese want to talk and, more important in Hanoi, they want to trade -- a desire shared by scores of American corporations that see Vietnam as the last great untapped business opportunity in Asia, a nation of 70 million people known for their industriousness and high educational standards, and whose labor is as cheap as any on the continent. The average household income in Vietnam is still less than $300 a year.  Boeing wants to sell jets to Vietnam. Citibank wants to do banking. Mobil Oil wants a chance to bid on tracts for offshore oil drilling. All have sent representatives to scout out future business. An end to the embargo would also permit the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to pour billions of dollars into basic service projects in a nation still largely without telephone service, reliable electricity and paved roads.  This month Japan said it would resume development aid to Vietnam. Business people from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and France have been investing in Vietnam for years. If the United States does not move quickly to establish diplomatic ties, American business leaders fear, they will lose the Vietnamese market forever, surrendering a country once thought so important to American interests that the United States went to war over it.

"      As the United States and Vietnam take tentative steps toward ending their 17-year diplomatic and economic separation, groups of veterans and relatives of military personnel missing in Southeast Asia have begun a battle to delay the reconciliation.  For the moment, their target is Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.  Mr. Kerry just completed a five-day trip to Southeast Asia, where he praised the Vietnamese for their cooperation in helping to determine what happened to the 2,265 Americans whose fate during the Vietnam War has never been determined.  Suggests Easing of Embargo  In response to what he considers unprecedented Vietnamese cooperation, Mr. Kerry said at a news conference today that the United States should show its good will by easing its trade embargo against Vietnam.  But fearful that photographs of Vietnamese officials' turning over helmets, wallets, diaries and other personal effects to Mr. Kerry will lead to an impression of Vietnamese compliance and a rush to normalize ties, a group of advocates have tried to discredit him.  Leaders of these organizations today accused Mr. Kerry, who served in Vietnam, of coaching witnesses who appeared before his committee in an effort to discredit satellite photographs these advocates say prove that Americans are still being held in Laos.  ""The Vietnam veterans and family members feel we have been betrayed by Senator John Kerry,"" said Thomas Burch, leader of the National Vietnam Veterans Coalition.  The allegations are not new -- and have been denied by Mr. Kerry -- and the groups making them are considered by some in the P.O.W.-M.I.A. movement to be more on the fringe. But that does not mean other more mainstream groups do not view with alarm Mr. Kerry's actions and reports that the Administration may move to build closer relations with Vietnam.  Last week, Roger A. Munson, national commander of the American Legion, wrote to Mr. Bush to urge him to ""hold the line"" on favorable actions toward Vietnam. Legion officers say that although the Vietnamese have released thousands of photographs and other artifacts and allowed committee aides to interview some soldiers who fought in the war, the increased cooperation has only led to possible identification of a handful of servicemen.  Without the threat of the continued trade embargo prodding them, Legion officials say, the Vietnamese will have no incentive to continue to cooperate.  ""We feel lifting the trade embargo is going to far,"" said John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion. ""It's the only leverage we have to resolve the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue.""

"    SON, Vietnam   Me Thi Ha believes she is a widow. But apart from the faded, red-bordered Government certificate proclaiming her husband a ""Vietnamese martyr in the struggle against America,"" she has no proof of his death.  Mrs. Ha worries about calling herself a widow because she still does not know how or when or where her husband died, and she says she probably never will.  ""Of course I understand how the Americans feel,"" she said. ""When I read in the newspapers how the Americans come here to search for the missing soldiers, I know exactly the pain of the families. We share the same grief.""  Missing and Presumed Dead    In Vietnamese homes, the red-bordered certificates are typically displayed in the finest wooden frames the families can afford, and as household decorations they are as common here as wall calendars and family photographs. Like the families of many Vietnamese soldiers, Mrs. Ha received the certificate instead of a body that the Vietnamese Army could never find.  According to the Hanoi Government, her husband, Capt. To Van Thinh, and more than 300,000 other Vietnamese soldiers are still missing and can only be presumed dead from what many Vietnamese in the north still call the War Against America.  About a million and a half Vietnamese were killed in the war -- 185,000 South Vietnamese soldiers, 924,000 North Vietnamese and Vietcong and 415,000 civilians. About 58,000 Americans died.  More than three-quarters of the Vietnamese missing are from central or north-central provinces, although the figure of 300,000 includes Vietcong as well as tens of thousands of soldiers who served in the South Vietnamese Army.  Careful With Americans  There are death certificates on display everywhere in Lang Son, a city of merchants and small farmers on Vietnam's mountainous northern border with China, about 80 miles northeast of Hanoi. Lang Son is the capital of Lang Son Province, home to nearly 2,400 soldiers listed as missing from the war.  The Vietnamese Government, which is eager to resume diplomatic and economic ties with the United States, is careful not to offend American visitors by suggesting directly that the sacrifice of Vietnamese families was greater than that of families in the United States.  But when American investigators come to Hanoi to press the Vietnamese to cooperate in the search for 2,265 Americans still listed as unaccounted for in Indochina, the Vietnamese will turn the conversation -- slowly, carefully, inevitably -- to the fact that so many more Vietnamese are also missing.  Few Dental Records  Hanoi's recent announcement that it will step up cooperation in the search for missing Americans by opening up its war archives is thought likely to result in a relaxation of a 17-year-old American trade embargo on Vietnam.  Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs is responsible for trying to help Vietnamese families determine the fate of missing soldiers, but there is little it can do.  ""Vietnam is a very poor country, and so the people must take responsibility for this themselves -- this must be a people's campaign,"" said Nghiem Xuan Tue, a military spokesman. ""Even when we have a soldier's remains, we have none of the modern technology to identify them.""  Dental records, among the most valuable tools the Pentagon has for identifying the remains of American troops, are usually not available for North Vietnamese soldiers, most of whom had never had a dental X-ray.  Families Keep Searching  As a North Vietnamese soldier in the early 1970's, Mr. Tue fought on some of the most grisly battlefields of the south, and he said it was common for northern soldiers to be buried hurriedly in shallow dirt graves marked only by a few stones.  ""In the war there was no time to bury a man properly,"" he said. ""I buried so many myself. You would leave stones on the grave and hope to go back someday to find it."" For thousands of soldiers who were hit by bombs dropped from B-52's, he said, there were no remains at all.  While the chances of finding a soldier's remains are virtually nonexistent, nearly 1,000 northern Vietnamese families apply to the Government each month for the chance to travel south to look for clues to the fate of missing relatives.  Proper Burial Is Essential  Many go armed only with a one-page typewritten letter that was commonly sent to families by the army informing them of little more than the fact that a soldier had died; if a family was lucky, the letter mentioned a province where the body might have been buried.  During the war, communication from the southern battlefields was difficult and dangerous, and mail from soldiers did not routinely travel north. Many northern families were not notified for years that a soldier had died or was missing.  Tran Van Ke, a 64-year-old shipping clerk from Lang Son, waited five years before he learned that his son had died of wounds suffered in South Vietnam.  ""His friends came home from the war in 1975 and told us our brave son died in 1970 and that he had been quickly buried,"" Mr. Ke said, reaching up to remove a small black-and-white photograph of his son, Tran Ban Tiep, from the wall of the front room of the family home. The 1968 photo showed a boyish Mr. Tiep, then 18, in full military uniform, carrying an AK-47 rifle.  ""His friends cannot remember where he was buried,"" Mr. Ke said. ""It is my great hope that we will someday discover where he is buried.""  Ancestor worship dominates the spiritual life of the Vietnamese, and it is considered essential that the remains of the dead be properly buried and venerated.  ""If I could afford the trip, I would go south to look for my husband,"" said Mrs. Ha, a retired army cook whose only income, apart from gifts from her three children, is a $5-a-month pension. ""Even if I could not find him, I would like to try. I am not a religious woman, but I do know I would feel relief in my dreams if I know where my husband was buried.""

"      A dispute arose at a Congressional hearing today when some military intelligence officials said that some analysts had a ""mind-set to debunk"" evidence of live American veterans who were reported missing in action or imprisoned during the Vietnam War.  Critics contend that such a mindset hindered the rescue of these Americans from Vietnamese captivity, and charges such as these have spurred reports that Americans might still be alive in Indochina.  The dispute erupted today at a hearing conducted by the Senate committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. affairs, which has released documents indicating that United States officials knew that servicemen were being held even after Vietnam supposedly released all American prisoners in 1973.  The intelligence experts agreed, however, that the investigations were plagued by ""external pressures"" from Congress and the families of those missing, as well as inadequate staffing, resources and lack of coordination among intelligence agencies.  Some described an atmosphere of cynicism around the investigation. Retired Rear Adm. Thomas A. Brooks, a former chief of naval intelligence, said, ""We had been confronted with so many reports that were deliberate fabrications or grossly inaccurate that the analysts became cynical."" He said ""professional predators"" who had made money exploiting the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue had provided reports that were ""given to analysts who knew the personalities involved"" and therefore had a ""mind-set to debunk"" them.  Retired Col. Kimball Gaines, who conducted a task-force review of the P.O.W./M.I.A. office in 1986, had used the phrase ""mind-set to debunk"" to describe the viewpoint of analysts of the Defense Intelligence Agency, which initially had sole intelligence reponsibility for these issues.  But Col. Joseph Schlatter, an intelligence officer who coined the phrase while working for Colonel Gaines, told the committee that he had been mistaken. ""At the time, I felt this charge was somewhat valid,"" he said. ""Now, I state without reservation my belief that this is a bogus charge.""  He deplored the pressures on the analysts. They were ""beset by so many outside tasks,"" he said, ""that they were constantly running from one crisis to another and didn't have time to do the important pick-and-spade work.""

"      Senator John F. Kerry today condemned as ""grotesque"" and ""fraudulent"" some lucrative fund-raising strategies that exploited the hopes of families of Americans missing or imprisoned during the Vietnam War.  Those direct-mail and telemarketing campaigns raised millions of dollars, ostensibly to pay for efforts to free Americans held in southeast Asia. But Joseph Salta, one direct-mail specialist who testified, said that of the $1.9 million he had raised, only $200,000 actually went to efforts to track down Americans. The remainder was spent on his fees (17.65 percent of all expenditures) and production costs, he said.  ""I find that unconscionable,"" said Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.  At a hearing on the fund-raising methods of such groups, the Senator said many campaigns used bogus information that bred cynicism and despair and hindered the efforts of legitimate organizations. The direct-mail specialists who testified said today that the information they used in their mailings was provided by their clients.  Preying on Families  Mr. Kerry said that he would send the information to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation.  ""It shocks me and stuns me that people can stoop to these mechanisms to get money out of people,"" the Senator said.  Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said, ""Sadly, the publicity attending this issue has been a powerful attraction for far too many scoundrels.""  ""They have preyed on the anguish of families, and helped to turn an issue which should unite all Americans into an issue that often divides us,"" Mr.  McCain said. ""What they have done rivals the cruelty of those Vietnamese who have exploited this issue for their cynical purposes.""  The Senators also questioned Bruce W. Eberle, a direct-mail advertising specialist whose firm, Bruce Eberle and Associates, sent an emotional appeal that purported to have been written on the deck of a ship in the China Sea.  ""Just today, I heard one more heart-rending account of an American serviceman being held captive by Communists in Vietnam,"" said the fund-raising letter.

"      James B. Stockdale, who ran as Ross Perot's Vice-Presidential candidate, said today that he is convinced that no American prisoners of war were left behind in North Vietnam when the United States pulled out its ground forces in 1973.  Mr. Stockdale, a former Naval aviator who was the highest-ranking American held by the Vietnamese at the Hoa Lo prison in Hanoi, told a Senate committee that American prisoners had set up an elaborate system to account for inmates in all prisons throughout North Vietnam.  When North Vietnam released 591 prisoners as part of the Paris peace accords, he said, all those who had been identified by the other prisoners were let go. ""I have no evidence of anybody that was left intentionally or is alive,"" he added.  He stressed, however, that his knowledge related only to prisoners in North Vietnam, not those in Laos.  The retired admiral's testimony before the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs may help debunk persistent reports that Americans soldiers or aviators were left when the United States withdrew. Mr. Stockdale was the leader of Americans held at Hoa Lo, known as the ""Hanoi Hilton.""  Mr. Stockdale is given another measure of credibility because of his affiliation with Mr. Perot, one of the strongest advocates for missing American prisoners in Southeast Asia. His wife, Sybil Stockdale, was a founder of the National League of Families, the largest organization of family members of missing servicemen.                               --------------------   China to Aid Search  BEIJING, Dec. 3 (AP) -- China has agreed to receive a team that will investigate reports of American servicemen listed as missing or held prisoner in the Korean and Vietnam wars, Senator David L.

Washington has no evidence that any prisoners remain alive in China, said Mr. Boren, who is visiting China.

"      Significantly easing the 17-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam, the Bush Administration said today that it would permit American companies to sign contracts to do business there.  The move is a response to what the Administration sees as greater Vietnamese cooperation in the search for the 2,264 American servicemen still listed as missing from the Vietnam War and makes renewed diplomatic ties increasingly likely.  ""I don't think there is any question that we are moving towards normalization of relations,"" said Larry Rivers, executive director of the Washington office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ""It's now only a question of when that occurs.""  May Be Just a First Step  So far, the Bush Administration has not said whether it would end the trade embargo or normalize relations before it leaves office on Jan. 20, though some experts who would like to see increased trade believe further steps in that direction are possible.  Like Mr. Bush, President-elect Bill Clinton has said he would not establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam as long as he believes Hanoi is withholding information on missing Americans. Aides to Mr. Clinton said they were not informed of Mr. Bush's announcement in advance.  The Administration's announcement does not mean a complete rapprochement. American companies can only sign contracts, open offices and hire staff in preparation for conducting business in Vietnam if the embargo is removed. At present, the broad prohibition against most trade with Vietnam remains.  A Strong Signal  Still, today's action signals a clear warming toward Vietnam after decades of bitterness and distrust.  ""This is a clear indication that the United States Government is sincere about economic and diplomatic normalization,"" said Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, which has lobbied for an easing of policy. ""We are beginning to let the war pass and build a new relationship with Vietnam. ""  Pressure on the Bush Administration has mounted in recent months as Hanoi has become more cooperative in investigations into the fate of the missing servicemen.  Welcomed by Key Senator  A number of people involved in the issue, including Senator John F. Kerry, chairman of the Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, have urged the Administration to reciprocate.  Senator Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, issued a statement saying he hoped the announcement ""leads to further progress in obtaining additional answers about the fate of Americans still listed as missing.""  Senator Kerry and Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican and the committee's vice chairman, are to leave Tuesday for another trip to press Hanoi for more information.  Worried About the Competition  Last month Japan extended a $380 million development loan to Hanoi; Japan and France have offered to repay Vietnam's loans from the International Monetary Fund. United States companies are concerned that increased economic ties between Tokyo and Hanoi might mean that they will lose out to Japanese companies in the Vietnam market.  ""A lot of people believe that there is more money to be made in Vietnam in the next 10 years"" than in China because of Vietnam's ""affinity with the West, the country's crushing needs and its highly educated populace,"" said Gerald Warburg, spokesman for the Multinational Business Development Coalition, a group of corporations that, like many business and trade organizations has lobbied for a relaxation in Washington's policy.  Veterans' organizations are split, however: the V.F.W. supports the move; the American Legion says Hanoi has not done enough to warrant easing the embargo.  ""I first went to Vietnam in July of 1991,"" said Mr. Rivers, of the V.F.W. ""I went back last month, and what was going on in '91 compared to what is going on in '92 is light-years away. The Vietnamese have a new sense of urgency. They have made a conscious decision to try to get this issue resolved.""  But John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion, said he was not impressed.  ""We're just totally disappointed and outraged at the President's announcement,"" he said. ""We don't believe that Vietnam's cooperation on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue has been as substantive as it has been cracked up to be.""

"    In the remaining weeks of his term, President Bush can finish the last chapter of the Vietnam War. More than 17 years after the end of formal hostilities, the groundwork has at last been laid for mutually profitable economic cooperation and normal diplomatic ties.  Mr. Bush has already made a good start by freeing U.S. companies to bid for future business in Vietnam. But Americans are still prohibited from doing such business, Washington still opposes loans to Hanoi from development banks, and diplomatic relations remain ruptured.  Mr. Bush's move on contracts was made possible by a dramatic shift in Hanoi. Vietnam now actively cooperates in looking for information about Americans missing since the war. Besides giving American researchers access to its military museums, Hanoi now publicly urges its citizens to report any remains they may uncover.  Pentagon witnesses told the Senate Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs this month that Washington had no evidence of any live Americans still in captivity. Even so, two committee leaders, John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Robert Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, flew to Vietnam this week to follow up on specific questions concerning a small number of Americans captured alive and never returned.  The Senators also seek further progress on remains, and hope to speak candidly with top Vietnamese leaders. They report to the White House next week. If all goes well, the Administration seems disposed to take further conciliatory steps.  No one, either on the Senate committee or in the White House, is yet talking about full diplomatic relations. Even Hanoi is far more interested in removing economic barriers than in exchanging ambassadors. But in truth, there is nothing to be gained from prolonging the diplomatic freeze past Inauguration Day.  The Administration has wisely declared that its goal is to reward and encourage Vietnam's new cooperativeness, not punish past delays. No major P.O.W.-M.I.A. issues remain unresolved. On Cambodia, the other U.S. test for normalization, Washington says that Vietnam is cooperating fully with U.N. peace efforts.  Normalization wouldn't eliminate U.S. leverage over Vietnamese behavior; Washington would still have the power to grant, withhold or condition most-favored-nation tariff status.  To defer rapprochement until after Bill Clinton becomes President is to invite recriminations from some veterans' groups that resent Mr. Clinton's efforts to avoid the draft. That World War II veteran and Vietnam hawk George Bush could do his country a patriotic favor by finally, honorably, ending America's longest war.

Previously, Vietnamese officials had said that only Laos could disclose information about incidents in their country, Senator Kerry, the chairman of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, said. But when he visited Vietnam on Thursday and Friday, Senator Kerry said, officials agreed to discuss incidents in Laos.  ""I think every American wants to see this issue resolved,"" he said during a stop in San Francisco.  His committee is to give the full Senate a progress report on Jan. 5 on the issues of prisoners of war and soldiers missing in action.  Senator Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that during this visit he had talked to Vietnamese officers who had interrogated American prisoners.  He said the next step would be to get transcripts from the interrogations of 38 P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, which could reveal additional information about other missing soldiers.  The committee has focused on locating 135 soldiers, but for the most recent trip the list was pared to the 38 who are considered most difficult to track.

"     M.I.A. Or Mythmaking in America. By H. Bruce Franklin. 225 pp. Brooklyn: Lawrence Hill Books. $17.95.  WHEN President Bush declared last year that ""we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all"" in the sands of the Middle East, he was acknowledging the staying power of a war that had ostensibly ended 16 years earlier. The subsequent flap over Gov. Bill Clinton's 1969 letter about his draft status demonstrates once again that the war in Vietnam and its spinoffs in Laos and Cambodia are far from a spent force in American life. Wars live on, first as tragedies, then as myths. H. Bruce Franklin's ""M.I.A."" casts strong light on the Indochina war's ghostly and ghastly afterlife.  When so-called primitive people insist on holding a strong belief contrary to evidence, anthropologists label the belief a myth and ask why people believe it, who mobilizes it and why. In a similar spirit, Mr. Franklin's meticulously researched book asks why a majority of Americans, according to public opinion polls, believe that prisoners of war are still being held in Indochina, and why many Americans are certain that the United States Government is lying about them. Why, he asks, if 8,177 Americans are still unaccounted for from the Korean War and some 78,750 from World War II -- without ever generating rescue missions, commemorative movies or a wave of paranoia -- should there be a long-running national obsession with some 2,273 unaccounted-for Americans in Vietnam?  Mr. Franklin, the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University, begins by casting persuasive doubt as to whether there remain any prisoners of war or servicemen missing in action abandoned in Indochina. But ""M.I.A."" is not, he cautions, a disproof of the undisprovable (try proving that Elvis isn't alive and well in Katmandu). Rather, he has written a history and an analysis of a faith. ""Because the evidence overwhelmingly indicates virtually no likelihood that there are any American prisoners of the Vietnam War still alive in Indochina,"" he writes, ""it is appropriate to treat the object of this faith as myth.""  By 1969, Americans had been captured and lost in the war for six years without loud outcry from Washington. The change came when Richard M. Nixon took office. ""Throughout President Nixon's first term,"" Mr. Franklin writes, ""the issue of P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s would serve mainly as an indispensable device for continuing the war, functioning on the domestic front as a potent counterforce to the antiwar movement while providing an ingenious tool for building insurmountable roadblocks within the peace talks.""  With White House and Congressional backing, many wives and parents of missing men mobilized. Later, the former leader of one group told Mr. Franklin: ""Nixon . . . just used the P.O.W. issue to prolong the war. Sometimes I feel guilty because with all our efforts, we killed more men than we saved.""  Once the fighting was over, the campaign in behalf of P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s had another political function: to justify the failure of the United States to comply with promises to aid postwar Vietnam. In 1973, according to Mr. Franklin, the Vietnamese and Laotian Communists ""actually released or accounted for 15 more prisoners than the Defense and State departments had listed as likely prisoners, even though both agencies had attempted to inflate their figures."" American figures ratcheted upward. The myth had it that only Asian Communist viciousness could explain the discrepancies in the numbers.  Enter Hollywood's formidable myth-making machinery. Mr. Franklin notes that the Oscar-winning 1978 movie ""The Deer Hunter"" featured scenes of Vietnamese Communists forcing captured American soldiers to play Russian roulette -- which, for all the atrocities they actually imposed on American prisoners, is one they had never perpetrated. Then, in 1982, President Ronald Reagan, who had played the eponymous Korean War hero in the 1954 film ""Prisoner of War,"" reportedly sanctioned a P.O.W.-seeking raid into Laos by a retired Special Forces officer, Col. James (Bo) Gritz. In a sort of Hollywood-Washington co-production, Mr. Franklin writes, Colonel Gritz raised funds from the actor William Shatner, who got film rights, and from the actor Clint Eastwood, who was assigned to communicate directly with President Reagan. Colonel Gritz's group failed to turn up any evidence of P.O.W.'s, but the Reagan Administration persisted in milking the issue.  In this climate, Hollywood found it had stumbled on a winning formula. ""Uncommon Valor"" (1983) proved a surprise success at the box office with a replica of Colonel Gritz, portrayed by Gene Hackman, bravely pursuing his raids despite the treachery of civilian Government agents. The cult of the rescue mission bulked still larger in the comic-strip superhunk bodies of Chuck Norris in ""Missing in Action"" (1984) and, of course, Sylvester Stallone in ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" (1985), who grunted, ""Do we get to win this time?"" Bulging muscles and hand-held machine guns were the retort to civilian backstabbers. Only in October 1985 -- when the belief in live P.O.W.'s had been, thanks to ""Rambo,"" market tested -- did the national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, become the first postwar White House official to maintain that ""there have to be live Americans there.""  If the current use of the P.O.W. myth is new -- to avert normalization of relations with Communist Vietnam -- the stuff of the P.O.W. myth is old. As Mr. Franklin makes clear, citing the literary historian Richard Slotkin's book ""Regeneration Through Violence,"" the sagas of the 1980's recycle old stories. The half-Indian John Rambo was the Reagan-era incarnation of a hunter-hero myth with roots in the 17th century.  For three centuries, up through ""America Held Hostage"" and beyond, America's storytellers have told tales of captivity and rescue -- chronicles of embattled innocence and avenging potency. Still unwilling to come to grips with the origins and the terrible legacy of the Vietnam War, many Americans comfort themselves with legends. But as Mr. Franklin's book makes clear, the believers are themselves held hostage to wishfulness. One reads his account wondering what is really missing in action in Vietnam.

"   , Vietnam, April 16   The American Telephone and Telegraph Company signed an agreement with Vietnam today on reopening telecommunication links that have been severed since the end of the Vietnam War.  The memorandum, signed by Vietnam's state telecommunications company, paves the way for the first link since the South Vietnamese Government fell to Communist forces from the North in 1975.  ""I believe that it is a major step forward for the two countries for the role that telecommunications will play in further improving relationships between our two countries and enabling citizens to speak to one another again,"" said James Hansen, A.T.& T.'s managing director for Southeast Asia.  Washington cut relations with Hanoi and imposed economic sanctions in 1964. It extended the measures to a reunified Vietnam in 1975. But in October, the United States said it was ready to move toward lifting the embargo and resuming diplomatic ties with Hanoi. It said Monday that it would modify the embargo to allow A.T.& T. to re-establish telecommunications links.  LOAD-DATE: April 17, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 16 1992 ,11
"   , Thailand, April 19   Soldiers who deserted during the Vietnam War may account for a number of reported sightings of Americans in Indochina after prisoners of war were returned in 1973, a United States Senator said today.  Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said at a news conference that there was evidence of ""a significant enough number"" of deserters to take into account when evaluating reports of sightings of American servicemen unaccounted for after the Vietnam War.  All American prisoners of war were supposed to be returned in 1973 under terms of the Paris peace accords, but some people believe that of the almost 2,300 Americans listed as missing some are still held captive.  Mr. Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, and four other members of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs are to begin a visit Monday to Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos.  Mr. Kerry, chairman of the committee, said the panel could identify no specific cases of American deserters who might still be alive. But he said it did have information about deserters and others who may have remained in Indochina after the war.  ""There is some evidence, still being measured, that some people were still alive in Laos after the 1973 accords,"" Mr. Kerry said, though he would not provide any details.  During their trip, the committee members plan to visit some caves in Laos where American prisoners are known to have been held.

"      The United States further relaxed its 28-year-old economic embargo against Vietnam today, saying it would allow commercial sales of items like food, medicine and farm machinery that meet basic human needs.  The State Department said that Washington would also lift restrictions on projects sponsored by American non-governmental and nonprofit groups.  The spokeswoman for the department, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said the Bush Administration decided to ease the embargo ""in response to Vietnam's strengthened commitments to take positive actions on P.O.W.-M.I.A. issues and its support of the United Nations political settlement process in Cambodia.""  ""It is in keeping with the established U.S. policy of a step-by-step process for normalizing relations with Vietnam,"" she said in a statement.  The Bush Administration began improving ties with Hanoi last October after approving a peace settlement for Cambodia, which was invaded by Vietnamese troops in late 1978.  The economic embargo was imposed on North Vietnam in 1964 and was extended to the south in 1975 when the American-backed government there fell to the Communist north.  Last week a delegation of United States senators visited Vietnam to inspect a prison camp and several military bases where they believed American servicemen might be held. The Vietnam War ended in 1975 and the United States says 2,266 servicemen are still unaccounted for.  Most of those servicemen are believed to be dead, but there have been unconfirmed reports that Americans were seen alive after the war.  The senators said they found no evidence during their trip that any missing American servicemen were still alive. They praised Hanoi's cooperation and said they were were hopeful that the issue could be resolved soon.  For many Americans, this issue remains a highly emotional barrier to improved relations with Vietnam.  Over the last year, scores of United States experts, working with Vietnamese officials, have dug up graves and interviewed villagers about servicemen missing from the war.  Economic competition is also a factor in the improvement of relations. Many businessmen from Japan and other nations have been moving eagerly into Vietnam, and American businesses fear they will be at a disadvantage in a fertile new market.

"      Eight large United States corporations, among them four oil companies, asked President Bush today to lift restrictions on business with Vietnam and allow Americans to compete in its growing market.  ""The United States economic sanctions with respect to Vietnam have become unilateral, with our allies and trade partners investing heavily and trading vigorously,"" said the letter from executives of Caterpillar, Boeing, Hunt Oil, Chevron, Amoco, Phillips Petroleum, Windmere, American International Group and the Coudert Brothers law firm.  ""Accordingly,"" the letter continued, ""the effect of the American embargo is not to deny Vietnam access to Western technology and financing, but rather to penalize U.S. companies to the benefit of foreign competitors. The United States is rapidly losing ground and is forfeiting to foreign competition a market where we could have a competitive edge.""  The executives requested a White House meeting to press their case.  In April, after a trip to Vietnam by an Assistant Secretary of State, Richard Solomon, the Administration concluded that Hanoi was making greater efforts to solve the cases of Americans missing or unaccounted for since the Vietnam War, and permitted telephone service to resume.  At the same time it also allowed American businesses to sell goods of a humanitarian nature -- medicines, food and clothing -- to the Vietnamese. But all other trade is prohibited.

"      At a time when the United States is moving steadily but slowly toward lifting an embargo and establishing diplomatic relations with Vietnam, Hanoi has chosen to send a strong if perplexing message to its people against fraternizing with Americans.  In mid-May, a southern Vietnamese lawyer who had aided homeless orphans with the backing of leaders of the American antiwar movement was sent to prison for 12 years for maintaining ties with United States citizens. His crime -- an ""anti-socialist act"" -- was trying to go into business with an American who advocates ending the embargo against the Vietnamese. He was arrested with another Vietnamese and Michael Morrow, a former American journalist who uncovered the story of the My Lai massacre.  The case might have gone unnoticed here if the lawyer had not been Doan Thanh Liem and the charity he assisted and later directed had not been the Shoeshine Boys project.  The project, begun in 1968 by an American conscientious objector, Richard Hughes, captured the imagination of Americans who were dismayed by the war. In Saigon and Danang, Mr. Hughes set up homes for boys, some of them severely handicapped, who had known nothing but rough life on the streets. After Mr. Hughes left Vietnam in 1976, the project was ended, and the balance of the money he had raised was used for another program for homeless children.  The official hounding of Mr. Liem after the fall of Saigon in 1975, culminating in his arrest in 1990 and his trial last month, has provoked in recent weeks a volley of letters to Hanoi from leading members of Congress and George S. McGovern, the former Senator and Presidential candidate who was an outspoken critic of the war.  A May 18 petition to the Vietnamese Communist Party's Secretary General, Do Muoi, from dozens of American intellectuals and celebrities reads like a who's who of the antiwar movement. Among the signers are Ed Asner, Daniel Berrigan, Noam Chomsky, Jane Fonda, Frances FitzGerald, Tom Hayden, Seymour Hersh, Ron Kovic, David Rabe, Oliver Stone and Cora Weiss.  ""If nothing else, it is severely damaging to Vietnam's efforts to rebuild and finally join the international family,"" said the petition to Mr. Muoi. ""It is time, Mr. Secretary, for all of us to realize our dream that the war be truly ended, that all the wounds be healed, here and in Vietnam, and that suspicion and misunderstanding become a thing of the past.""  The cases of Mr. Liem and Do Ngoc Long, another former manager of the Shoeshine Boys project who is also under arrest, are painful for Americans who consider themselves friends of Vietnam, Mr. Hughes said in an interview Sunday from his home in Manhattan. He is now an actor with the Circle Repertory Company and other theaters.  Mr. Hughes, branded a Central Intelligence Agency spy by hard-liners in Hanoi who seem to fear Western influence more than they want economic liberalization, said that for years Americans who had been in the antiwar movement chose to ignore repressive actions by Hanoi by saying they had to be understood ""in a political context.""  ""I've reached a point where I said to Vietnam, this is no longer acceptable,"" said Mr. Hughes, who was forced to leave the country in August 1976, a year after the fall of Saigon.  ""Vietnam was never about Vietnam,"" he said. ""Vietnam was the defining event of a generation, but it was something to service everyone else except the Vietnamese.""  Mr. Hughes said Vietnamese had told him that some officials are embarrassed by the treatment of his former aides, Mr. Liem and Mr. Long.  The two men were arrested in April 1990 along with Mr. Morrow, who planned to set up a consulting company to advise American businesses in Vietnam. Mr. Long, an economist, and Mr. Liem, the lawyer, had hoped to become partners in the joint venture.  Mr. Morrow was released after three weeks of detention in Ho Chi Minh City.  A month later, Mr. Muoi was again pleading publicly for help from industrialized nations in rebuilding Vietnam.  LOAD-DATE: June 7, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",June 7 1992 ,11
"   , Vietnam   Old-guard Communists still wield power here in what remains a sternly ruled one-party capital. Red banners proclaiming fidelity to the legacy of the late President Ho Chi Minh are strung across the streets of this lovely city of traditional Vietnamese and French colonial architecture.  But after decades of reticence toward foreigners and uniformity of expressed views, people in Hanoi now speak in many and varied voices.  They engage visitors in open conversation in the streets, eager to practice their English, which young and old are earnestly studying as the key to a better future. And, in a practice unthinkable until recently, they invite foreigners into their small apartments in rundown buildings and disclose views that belie the image of single-minded heroism and austerity cultivated under Communist rule in northern Vietnam since 1954.  A scholar in his 60's, who fought against the French in the 1940's and has been a Communist Party member since then, laughed when asked how people squared Vietnam's new enthusiasm for capitalism with equally ringing affirmations, anchored in the Constitution revised this year, of the leading role of the Communist Party.  A Different Look at War  ""It reminds me of my grandfather, a very strict mandarin,"" he said in the melodious French of the old Indochina. ""When I was a boy, he sent me letters, very severe letters. 'If you don't obey your father and teachers, I don't recognize you as my grandson,' he wrote. His strictness shocked me. But later I learned that he had mistresses in every town.  ""This is just like the party speeches,"" he added. People laugh at them. With my friends, whenever somebody mentions the differences between what we say and what we practice, all we can do is burst out laughing. The people in the countryside feel the same way. They are even more practical than pragmatists. They expect politicians to make speeches they don't mean.""  Bao Ninh is the 40-year-old author of a best-selling novel that for the first time describes the war between South and North not as a heroic struggle by noble Communists against American puppets but as bitter savagery between brothers, with the destructive participation of a foreign superpower.  The novel, ""The Sorrow of War,"" won last year's national prize of the Writers Association despite criticism of its determinedly nonheroic character. The writer was spared personal attack largely because in the novel he drew on his own experience. Drafted at the age of 19 in 1971, he took part in heavy fighting as a member of a reconnaissance company until the end of the war in 1975.  ""There was bitterness,"" Bao Ninh (that is a pen name for Hoang Phuong) said in an interview in his crowded apartment in a Soviet-style tenement block. ""True, the Americans were fierce with their bombs and sophisticated weapons. And the latter part of the war took on the dark color of civil war.  ""But today,"" he continued, ""we feel no hatred toward the Americans -- that is the truth. And when I meet a corporal from the Saigon forces, I feel closer to him than to a captain from our side.""  A View of Postwar Vietnam  Bao Ninh, himself a corporal, spoke of postwar Vietnam.  ""We soldiers from the North feel sad today,"" he said. ""We struggled for the liberation of the whole nation, but we achieved the poverty of the whole nation. We feel sorry for the southerners who had to become boat people, and for the nation that has become tattered, and the soldiers from the South that could find no work. We feel sorry for those who spent years in re-education camps.""  Bao Ninh and his father, Hoang Tue, a linguistics scholar, disagreed with the official view that the North's victory was a triumph of Communism.  ""It was a victory of the national spirit,"" the writer said. ""The soldiers' feeling was that the Saigon army belonged to the Americans. Our aim was not to smash them to bits but to gain victory for peace. The simple soldier never thought of Communism. Maybe that was in the minds of the leaders. We wanted to get the war over with.""  Bao Ninh, who served after the fighting ended in a unit that gathered the remains of fallen North Vietnamese soldiers, spoke sympathetically of the desire of American families to retrieve the remains of those still missing in Vietnam. But father and son condemned what they called the political use of the issue in the United States to delay normalization of relations with Vietnam.  The writer spoke feelingly of the far greater number of Vietnamese families who do not know if or where their sons or husbands were buried.  ""Our Government is so poor,"" he said. ""We would like to demand that Vietnamese mothers, too, can go to burn incense sticks on their sons' graves. But we know the Government can't afford it.""  In the bookstores of Hanoi, plaster busts of Ho and medallions with profiles of Marx and Lenin still make up the decor. But while this trinity accounted for most of the books on sale in the past, now not even the collected speeches of the father of the Vietnamese revolution are available.  'Scarlett' Is the Rage  Instead, there are pirated translations, between garish covers, of American, British or French best sellers. ""Scarlett"" is the rage of Hanoi, but English language textbooks and computer manuals outsell all other categories.  Even in officially arranged interviews -- in the past no more informative than editorials in the party press -- candor is now the rule.  Le Dang Doanh, deputy director of an official economics research institute, went so far as to put Marx's teaching in doubt. ""He elaborated an idyllic society, without motivation,"" he said. ""Too nice to be true. I'm far from declaring Marx is dead, but I'm absolutely against accepting Marxism as the Holy Bible.""  But asked whether he felt free to publish such heretical thoughts, Mr. Doanh thought briefly. ""It would be unpopular to write this,"" he said with a smile.

"      The Defense Department recently brought a Vietnamese Government film maker to the United States because he said he had new information about Americans still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, officials say. But the film maker, Trung Hieu, failed to produce any useful material, and is now seeking political asylum.  The case is likely to set off a new round of raised hopes and charges of fraud by opposing forces on this emotionally charged issue, just before a crucial round of public hearings is held by the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.  The committee, headed by Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and Vietnam veteran who opposed the war after his return home, had hoped to defuse the issue in a year of thorough investigations.  Mr. Hieu was first interviewed in Bangkok by Defense Department officials tracking the 2,266 Americans still officially missing in Indochina. They decided that Mr. Hieu, a documentary maker for Hanoi during the war and after, might have had important information worthy of a closer examination in Washington.  Claim of Other Information  ""The United States Government and the Department of Defense are always open to any credible information people may have regarding prisoners of war and those missing in action,"" a senior Administration official said. ""Based on the claims that this man made that he had photographs that would be useful to us, we facilitated his travel to the U.S.""  ""The information he had did not prove useful,"" the official said. ""He now claims to have other information, but he seems to be unwilling to provide it.""  Mr. Hieu, who is staying at an undisclosed address in the Washington area, would not be interviewed on Wednesday or today.  David Crosland, former general counsel and acting director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now in private law practice, has agreed to represent Mr. Hieu, whose American visa expires on Friday.  The Vietnamese film maker has told at least two Americans that the Defense Intelligence Agency, the intelligence arm of the Pentagon, had tried unsuccessfully to recruit him in Bangkok for work in Vietnam, and that American agents in Bangkok had helped him get a United States visa. Administration officials would not comment on the recruitment charge.  Mr. Hieu, who is reported to be about 54 years old and a longtime employee of Hanoi's Ministry of Culture, was interviewed on Monday by staff members of the Senate committee. He returned to give more testimony today.  Among officials, Congressional aides and private veterans' organizations, the story of Mr. Hieu and his trip here set off memories of an earlier case in which a Vietnamese refugee in Hong Kong who had been a mortician was brought to the United States with his family because he said he had knowledge of a warehouse in Hanoi where the remains of 400 Americans were stored. His testimony has been the subject of fierce controversy ever since.  On Tuesday, Mr. Hieu went to the office of Representative John Miller, Republican of Washington, to ask for asylum, unaware that members of Congress do not have this power. Staff members advised him to seek legal help.  Vietnamese officials at Hanoi's United Nations Mission in New York say that while they are aware of Mr. Hieu's work in Vietnam, they had no information on reports that he was trying to stay in the United States.  Helped by M.I.A. Group  In the last few days, Mr. Hieu has been helped by Ted Sampley, a North Carolina contractor who heads the Homecoming II Project, which raises money to publicize the cause of those who believe American prisoners may still be alive in Vietnam. The project has also offered rewards to Indochinese who can provide information on Americans they believe remain in custody in Laos, Cambodia or Vietnam.  In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Sampley said he first met Mr. Hieu on Monday at the Capitol Hill Quality Inn. He said the Vietnamese, who said he had brought negatives and videotapes with him from Hanoi, asked only for access to American relatives of missing servicemen. The Homecoming II Project is planning a national meeting on July 23 at which many families will be represented.  Beyond that request, Mr. Sampley said, Mr. Hieu asked for ""absolutely nothing."" Payment for the use of the material was never mentioned.  The Homecoming II project has hired a lawyer for Mr. Hieu, Mr. Sampley said.  He said Mr. Hieu had told him that he had -- or knew where to find in Hanoi -- pictures of American plane crashes that clearly showed victims or survivors.

"    Just when Washington seems ready to acknowledge that the Vietnam War is over, Hanoi is cruelly stirring its ghosts.  Last month Doan Thanh Liem was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment for anti-Socialist activity. The case against him grew out of his efforts to attract Western businesses to Vietnam, in conjunction with Michael Morrow, an American who has long worked for reconciliation with Hanoi.  During the war years, Mr. Liem won renown for his work with homeless children in Saigon and Da Nang in a project called the Shoeshine Boys. At the time, he worked closely with Richard Hughes, an American conscientious objector and war critic.  Hanoi's hard-line Communists have always had trouble making a distinction that came easily to Mr. Liem -- between the conscientious actions of individual Americans and Washington's official policies. For example, Hanoi assumed that Mr. Hughes must have been an intelligence agent because Washington did nothing to suppress his antiwar work. Mr. Morrow's private efforts to reconcile the two countries seem likewise to have aroused Hanoi's suspicions.  And now Mr. Liem, a victim of guilt by association, faces cruel punishment. It has taken Washington a painfully long time to get over its Vietnam defeat. How much longer will it take Hanoi's hard-liners to get over their victory?

"      President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia said today that some Americans captured during the Vietnam War were apparently transferred from Hanoi to labor camps in the Soviet Union. He added that some of them may still be alive, possibly in psychiatric hospitals.  Mr. Yeltsin made his statements in an interview with NBC News as he flew from Moscow to Washington for a summit meeting with President Bush on Tuesday.  If the assertions made by Mr. Yeltsin are true -- he said they were based on a first impression drawn from the recent release of Soviet archives -- the information could profoundly change the history of the contentious issue of American prisoners of war.  The White House said tonight that it could not comment on the substance of Mr. Yeltsin's statement.  ""We have been discussing the P.O.W. issue with the Russians for quite a while,"" Doug Davidson, a White House spokesman, said tonight, ""and it will be on the agenda with President Yeltsin on Tuesday.""  Some Administration officials say they believe that earlier statements by Mr. Yeltsin and his aides on these issues may have been intended to shore up his position in Russia and to discredit the former Communist Government and hard-liners who oppose him.  The new information, which Mr. Yeltsin said was still being investigated more fully, could also pose political problems for President Bush. Ross Perot, who is seeking the Presidency in this year's election, has been sympathetic to lobby of families who have kept this issue alive since American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1973. Mr. Perot has said on numerous occasions that he believes prisoners could still be alive despite the denials of the Vietnamese and skepticism expressed by the Pentagon, and he has traveled to Hanoi to discuss the issue.  Moscow Had Denied Transfers  Last year, President Bush raised the issue with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev before the Soviet leader stepped down. Moscow repeated its denial that Americans had been brought to the Soviet Union from Vietnam, as some former American intelligence analysts and others have charged.  Mr. Davidson said that reports that Vietnam-era servicemen were being held in the Soviet Union were not new, and that the American Embassy in Moscow had been pursuing the assertions through diplomatic channels.  Richard L. Armitage, who as a senior Defense Department official negotiated this issue with the Vietnamese in the mid-1980's, said in an interview tonight that ""if this is true, it is a fantastic breakthrough and a very positive development.""  Mr. Armitage, who now directs American assistance to the former Soviet republics as the State Department's Deputy Coordinator for the new independent states, said that to his knowledge the United States had no information like Mr. Yeltsin's assertion despite recent fact-finding trips to Russia by American officials trying to close the book on the issue.  Focus on Vietnamese  ""If true, this also casts further doubt on the assertions of the Vietnamese that they didn't transfer prisoners,"" he said. ""It makes on wonder how forthcoming they are being.""  Family members of Americans unaccounted for since the Vietnam war have accused successive Administrations of covering up information on prisoners who may have been left behind in Indochina.  ""I feel that with Yeltsin's information we family members can challenge the Department of Defense to declassify all P.O.W.-M.I.A. documents from 1945 and including the Vietnam war,"" said Dolores Apodata Alfond, a founder of the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, a group representing relatives of people missing from all wars since World War II.  Ms. Alfond's brother, Maj. Victor J. Apodata, was shot down over Vietnam on June 6, 1967. In 1986, a former National Security Agency broadcast monitor, Jerry Mooney, told Congressional investigators and family members that Major Apodata had been traced by radio interception as ""Moscow bound"" after his capture.  On Friday, Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged for the first time to a Senate committee that is examining the prisoner issue that the Soviet Union had imprisoned Americans during World War II, when Washington and Moscow were allies, and had sent to labor camps and psychiatric wards an unknown number of Americans who were shot down during the Korean War or who were on aerial reconnaissance missions during the cold war.  Those comments, included in a letter, were described as ""an acknowledgement of unprecedented proportions"" by Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.  In his interview today with the television network today, Mr. Yeltsin was asked:  ""For years there have been rumors in the United States that American P.O.W.'s from the Vietnam War were transferred from Vietnam to the Soviet Union. Do you know that to be true?""  Mr. Yeltsin, according to NBC, answered:  ""Our archives have shown that it is true, some of them were transferred to the territory of the former U.S.S.R. and were kept in labor camps. We don't have complete data and can only surmise that some of them may still be alive.""  Answering questions from the NBC reporter, Stone Phillips, Mr. Yeltsin said these cases were under investigation.  Since Friday, when Mr. Yeltsin's unexpected letter was delivered to the Senate by Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, who heads the Russian half of a joint commission set up in May to investigate the issue of prisoners and missing Americans from World War II to the present, families of missing servicemen have renewed criticisms of successive administrations for their handling of this matter.  In Washington today, General Volkogonov said that the Russian authorities were investigating whether an American man reportedly sighted in the Ural Mountains might be one of hundreds of American citizens missing since World War II.

"      President Boris N. Yeltsin today bolstered his assertion that American prisoners of war were transferred to the Soviet Union from Vietnam, saying Russia had a list of names under investigation that included United States servicemen captured in Indochina.  His statement introduced more confusion into the debate over Americans unaccounted for from half a century of conflicts involving the former Soviet Union and its allies. Administration officials and Congressional leaders said this was the first time they had heard of such a list.  Administration officials said they had no information to back up Mr. Yeltsin's assertions, which included speculation that some Americans, brought to Soviet labor camps or psychiatric hospitals, may still be alive.  A Congressional hearing to explore the issue was canceled today after the Administration declined to let Malcolm Toon testify. Mr. Toon, who heads the American contingent of the Russian-American commission investigating the missing, is preparing to go to Moscow to examine old Soviet files. The Administration would rather he testify after his return.  22,554 Names Investigated  Mr. Yeltsin, speaking to reporters after a lunch with Congressional leaders, described the work being done by the Russian side, saying, ""Among the 22,554 names that the commission has so far investigated, there were names of the American prisoners of war in Vietnam which the Vietnamese at that time transferred to the former Soviet Union.""  Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of Oregon and deputy chairman of the committee, said, ""What is significant is that he very specifically singled out Vietnam.""  At a news conference today, Mr. Yeltsin said: ""The most important thing is that we know the numerical picture. We know how many people there were on the territory, how many were left, what camps the P.O.W.'s were held in, the citizens of the United States, which war they were from.""  ""We know who died, where they are buried,"" he said, speaking through an interpreter. ""What we still don't know, we don't know a certain number of people, really, where they belong, and we have no, simply no information about them. And this is why we say that maybe some of them are still alive and still in Russia, and this is where we say we'd like to find further documents on these people.""  'I Will Find Him'  Mr. Yeltsin earlier told a joint meeting of Congress: ""I, as President, pledge to you: If we had detained a single American, he can be found, and I will find him and return him to his family.""  Douglas Pike, director of the Indochina Studies and the Indochina Archives at the University of California at Berkeley, said, ""There were persistent stories throughout the war that the Vietnamese were turning over P.O.W.'s to the Russians."" But he said many of the stories did not check out.  Nevertheless, Mr. Pike, a Foreign Service linguist in Vietnamese who was assigned in the late 1970's to the Pentagon's International Security Agency as a ""Hanoi watcher,"" said he was inclined to believe that some Americans had probably been turned over to Russians.  Mixed Emotions for Families  Among the families of American service personnel who are unaccounted for, the developments have engendered a variety of emotions, from concern that false hopes will be raised to outrage that the Russians may produce more information than American officials have made public over decades.  All over the United States, families have been amassing small libraries of information. They say that nothing Mr. Yeltsin said has surprised them.  A Seattle journalist, Mark Sauter, who has just completed a book on the issue of half a century of missing Americans, has found letters and memos in public records that show repeated efforts to limit or block the circulation of information on United States servicemen or women taken into custody and thought to be in Soviet hands after several wars.  Relatives of missing Americans appear not to want Mr. Yeltsin to pay a price in Congress for his candor on this issue, however.  ""Family members are not interested in withholding aid from the Russians,"" said Dolores Apodaca Alfond, head of the National Alliance of Families, a group representing the relatives of people lost in all conflicts since World War II. ""We don't blame the Russians for what's happened in the past. We just want the truth.""                               --------------------   Inquiry Into a Sighting  MOSCOW, June 17 (Special to The New York Times) -- A Russian-American team of investigators is to fly Thursday to a distant prison camp in the Komi Autonomous Republic in Russia to investigate a report of a sighting of an American prisoner, American officials said tonight.  The chairman of the Senate Select Committee, Senator John F. Kerry, said in a telephone interview that the case involved someone missing from the Korean War period.  The Associated Press reported the object of the search was First Lieut. Robert Martin, a pilot captured by North Korea and sentenced to one year in prison for striking an interrogator.  American officials in Moscow said the investigators would fly to Pechora, about 950 miles northeast of Moscow.

"      When evidence that American servicemen were detained in Soviet labor camps in the 1940's and 50's was turned over to a Senate committee last week by the Russians, and President Boris N. Yeltsin suggested that the practice may have extended into the Vietnam era, an obvious question was: For what purpose would Americans have been brought to the Soviet Union?  Some groups and relatives who monitor the missing say that if Moscow did obtain such servicemen from the North Vietnamese, it may have been to learn more about advanced American military technology.  Other groups challenge the high-tech theory. Ann Mills Griffiths, head of the National League of Families, which represents the Vietnam-era missing, said that exhaustive computer crosschecks of the 2,266 people unaccounted for in Indochina -- especially the approximately 135 ""discrepancy cases"" where officials believe the Vietnamese may be withholding information -- have never revealed a pattern of experience with high technology.  Douglas Pike, a specialist on Vietnam at the Pentagon in the late 1970's who is now director of the Indochina Studies Program at the University of California at Berkeley, said Americans with special knowledge were kept from flying into areas where they might be captured. The Pentagon closely watched personnel who might be of unusual interest to Hanoi, Moscow or Beijing, he said.  He added that it was not unlikely that some American prisoners may have been moved from Hanoi to Moscow, although he questioned why they could not have been ""deprogrammed"" by the Russians in Vietnam. The Russian and Vietnamese presses have been trading charges on the issue in recent years, he said, but he remains skeptical.  The solid explanations, of course, will probably have to wait for years, for the opening of more Russian archives.

"      A Russian document given to a Senate committee discloses that 125 servicemen previously listed as dead or missing in the Korean War actually survived and were turned over to Soviet interrogators in North Korea, leaders of the Senate Select Committtee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs said today.  An unknown number of those servicemen were later transferred to Chinese custody and may have been sent to China, the Senators said. North Korea, China and the former Soviet Union consistently denied that any captured Americans were turned over to Soviet or Chinese officials.  At the Chinese Embassy here, Hu Ping, the spokesman, said Beijing had no comment on the report. North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not return calls made to Pak Gil Yon, the chief delegate, or Hyon Hak Bong, the mission spokesman.  The Russian list reflects what Moscow knew in the 1950's and does not deal with the issue of whether any of those Americans are still alive. The list also does not shed light on the question of whether any of those servicemen were taken to the Soviet Union.  The Korean War list, which is also in the possession of a Presidential commission investigating the missing in cooperation with a Russian panel, was released at a news conference by Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire and deputy committee chairman, who said that ""this information belongs to the American people.""  Minutes later, the committee also announced in a news release that it had won the declassification of more than 70 United States Government documents concerning the search for missing Americans during and after the Vietnam War.  ""We think the Korean documents are very significant because of the sources from which they come, though I'm not at liberty to disclose those,"" said Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the select committee. ""At the time they were given to us in Moscow we were told point blank that these people were given to China.""  In an interview after the two announcements, Senator Kerry, saying that information had been kept hidden from the American public for too long, said the committee would vote next week to ask the Administration to release all relevant documents from security and intelligence agencies, the White House and the Pentagon.  ""We believe this issue can be resolved only by airing it,"" Senator Kerry said. ""We are mindful of need to protect sources and methods.""  Among the American documents whose declassification was announced today are nearly 50 different and apparently conflicting lists of American prisoners of war in Vietnam; Administration policy statements ordering officials first to cover up losses and later to withhold information from families; military intelligence analyses of prisoners held in Laos -- the largest number in Indochina -- and a 1976 secret report indicating that there may have been five deserters still in Vietnam whose names have not been disclosed.  Senator Smith told reporters that in many cases families of those missing in Korea had been told that relatives had died in combat or captivity.  ""We are now told by people in the Russian Government that they were in North Korea,"" he said.  Relatives of Korean War-era servicemen can obtain a copy of the committee's analysis of the list, with the names of the 125 Americans previously thought to have died, by writing to the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, United States Senate, Washington D.C. 20510-6500.  Senator Smith said he believed that a similar situation, where not all Americans declared dead had actually perished, prevailed after the Vietnam War. He told reporters today that the committee had information, still being investigated, that Americans were seen in Indochina as late as 1989.  The debate over missing Americans, particularly from the Vietnam years, revolves around two separate issues: whether service personnel or covert agents were left behind and then deliberately ""forgotten"" by successive American Administrations, and whether any Americans might still be alive.

"      A Senate committee chairman took issue today with almost two decades of Administration assertions that all Vietnam War prisoners were accounted for when Washington and Hanoi signed a cease-fire accord in 1973. He said his committee's reading of official documents led him to believe that as many as 133 might have still been alive and in captivity at the time.  Opening two days of hearings, questioning present and former government officials whose job it was to keep track of missing Americans, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the committee, also said that from 1965 to 1972 files on people involved in covert operations, often in Laos or Cambodia, were deliberately falsified to protect secrecy.  This deception, he said, fueled conspiracy theories and fed the perception in many families ""that the Government was not dealing straight with them.""  Senator Kerry's conclusions were not challenged substantially by a panel of officials from the armed services, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon's Directorate of Information, Operations and Reports.  ""Taken together, the information available to the committee does constitute evidence that some Americans remained alive in Indochina after Operation Homecoming,"" said Senator Kerry, referring to to the final prisoner exchange early in 1973, when 591 Americans were returned by Hanoi. ""This is enough in my mind to contradict official statements made then and repeated for almost two decades.""  He said the documents showed that 244 servicemen should have been listed as captives, besides the 591 returned. Of that number, 111 were later reported to have died in Vietnam, leaving 133 Americans whose cases have not been explained.  Mr. Kerry said that there was no absolute proof that the 133 were alive at the end of the war, or that any had survived since then.  He said that evidence of American officials' pressing Hanoi at the highest levels for information on servicemen in captivity at the end of the war and immediately after indicated that the Government knew of more possible prisoners but never said so publicly.  The issue had been complicated by Vietnam's inconsistency in disclosing the names of prisoners. It did not provide them to the International Committee of the Red Cross, but occasionally made some public through various Senate offices.  Thus, when the prisoners were released it was not possible to be sure whether every prisoner was accounted for. There were many pilots, for instance, who had been seen to bail out successfully, or who had radioed their location on the ground but were not returned in 1973.  Henry A. Kissinger, who was national security adviser in the Nixon Administration in early 1973 and who negotiated the cease-fire accord, told of confronting Hanoi after the Paris peace accord with 80 names of servicemen who were believed to have been prisoners but who had not been returned in Operation Homecoming.  Mr. Kissinger has agreed to make his papers available to the Senate panel, the Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A Affairs, pending White House approval, Mr. Kerry said. The White House has not yet given that permission.  Witnesses at today's hearing, almost all of whom were at the crux of the prisoner issue in 1973, said that it was not possible to explain some of the decisions made at that time without recalling the intense desire of American politicians and the American people to put Vietnam behind them.  Adm. Thomas Moorer, Retired, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1971 to 1975, said that the atmosphere of the period made the Vietnam War ""a very painful experience.""  ""Demonstrators were pouring blood on the Pentagon steps, lying down on Constitution Avenue and blocking traffic, harassing military personnel, instigating riots such as the tragedy at Kent State University, and many young men were escaping to Canada,"" he said.

"      A special Presidential envoy to Hanoi said today that five years of discussions with the Vietnamese about missing United States servicemen have produced no evidence that any of the Americans are still alive in Vietnam.  But the envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey, also said in testimony to the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs that he had found no new information to change the perception that Americans were left behind in Vietnam in 1973, when United States forces withdrew from Indochina.  General Vessey, who was appointed by President Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by President Bush in 1989, said the Vietnamese were not cooperative enough in opening official records to answer questions about missing Americans.  135 'Discrepancy Cases'  In particular, General Vessey has been pressing for the resolution of 135 ""discrepancy cases"" among 2,266 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina. These are cases that the United States beleives Hanoi could resolve ""readily,"" he said.  ""A few of them were people we believed to have died in captivity and whose remains were not returned,"" he said. ""Most of them were people who the U.S. believed the evidence showed had survived their loss incident and were likely to have been captured and who did not return at Homecoming, and whose remains had not been returned nor had any other explanation been given."" Operation Homecoming was the name given the postwar prisoner exchange.  The committee's chairman, Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, today released further evidence that in 1973 it was widely assumed within the Nixon Administration that Americans were still alive in Vietnamese custody. The evidence was contained in a confidential memorandum in April 1973 to the Pentagon from Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker in Saigon outlining a strategy for approaching the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong on the subject of unrecovered bodies and remaining prisoners.  The memo was written three months after the Paris peace agreement, the exchange of prisoner lists with Hanoi and a public statement by President Nixon that all the Americans had come home.  80 Believed Captured Alive  The memo refers to 80 Americans, ""who, according to U.S. records, were believed to be captured alive."" It advised the United States to develop a more comprehensive list of the missing and dead ""on whom there is considered to be a reasonable probablity of obtaining information.""  In the second of two days of public hearings, officials in the State and Defense Departments who were responsible for tracking the missing at the end of the Vietnam War said that Vietnam's refusal to abide by an article in the Paris agreement relating to the accounting for servicemen, compounded by the ineffectiveness of the International Commission of Control and Supervision charged with monitoring the accord, made the active search for Americans virtually impossible on the ground.  On the American side, the continued covert United States military operations in Laos, also in violation of the peace treaty, considerably complicated the search in that country, where a large number of cases remain unresolved.  Tempers rose today in the hearing room when Senator Kerry and others on the panel questioned Roger E. Shields, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs.  A Tape and a Memo  Mr. Shields had made an oft-quoted declaration on April 12, 1973 -- which Mr. Kerry replayed on tape today -- that the United States had ""no indication at this time that there are any Americans alive in Indochina.""  Senator Kerry confronted Mr. Shields, who stood by his statement, with copies of a memo he wrote the following month in which he said that the position adopted by the Defense Department was ""no longer satisfactory."" Mr. Kerry called him ""disingenuous"" in defending his 1973 statement.  In an earlier deposition to the committee, Mr. Shields was also quoted describing a meeting in 1973 with Deputy Secretary of Defense William Clements. According to the deposition, Mr. Clements, speaking of missing Americans, told Mr. Shields, ""They're all dead,"" and Mr. Shields replied, ""You can't say that.""  ""You didn't hear me,"" Mr. Clements was reported to have said. ""They're all dead.""  Mr. Clements had earlier agreed to testify before the committee. Today Mr. Kerry said the former assistant secretary had changed his mind.  LOAD-DATE: June 26, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",June 26 1992 ,11
"    The Pentagon knew better. Hanoi knew better. Yet in April 1973, the Nixon Administration insisted it had no indication ""that there are any Americans alive in Indochina."" Those words concealed a startling fact: The Administration did have the names of 244 Americans who had been captured alive but who failed to return with the other prisoners of war Hanoi released that year.  That news and more was disclosed last week by the Senate Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs. Led by two Vietnam veterans, Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts and Republican Robert Smith of New Hampshire, the committee is giving Americans the chance to judge how successive Administrations handled the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue.  The effort deserves full cooperation from the Bush Administration. Instead, the White House threatens to withhold documents.  Returning P.O.W.'s reported that 111 of those 244 missing Americans had definitely died in captivity. What about the other 133? If there was no ""indication"" they were alive, there was also no ""indication"" they were dead.  Yet according to sworn testimony released by the committee, William Clements, then the Deputy Secretary of Defense, bluntly proclaimed, ""they're all dead."" When an informed subordinate corrected him, Mr. Clements reportedly replied: ""You didn't hear me. . . . They're all dead.""  At the least, officials twisted the truth. If their goal was to stifle public debate, their efforts backfired spectacularly and the price in credibility is still being paid. P.O.W. relatives were stonewalled along with everyone else; some later became easy marks for hustlers.  The cost may have been crueler still. Hanoi began bidding for U.S. recognition and aid in 1973. Washington might well have exploited Hanoi's need for international assistance to win a more satisfactory accounting of the missing soldiers. And additional Americans might have been located and returned alive.  Once-promising trails have grown cold. Americans who might have been under Hanoi's control in 1973 may have died or disappeared. Yet the committee is right to press forward. Ross Perot is scheduled to make a sworn deposition this week. Henry Kissinger has agreed to let the committee examine records of his negotiations with Hanoi over P.O.W. issues.  The Bush Administration, however, citing executive privilege, denies access to these records. That's perverse, for at last Americans have a chance to learn the truth about this painful legacy of a painful war. It may be too late to bring back any American prisoners. It's not too late to bring back the truth.  LOAD-DATE: June 29, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",June 28 1992 ,11
"    Following are excerpts from a letter sent by Ross Perot to President Ronald Reagan on April 8, 1987, on Mr. Perot's study of American prisoners of war in Southeast Asia.  Dear Mr. President:  My findings on the POW/MIA study are as follows:  We left POWs behind at the end of the war in Vietnam.  We knew we were leaving men behind.  The men left behind were held in Laos.  The evidence that men were held in Laos is substantial --  *There are 343 MIAs in Laos.  *During the war, Pathet Lao officials repeatedly made public statements about holding POWs, including statements made directly to me.  *The CIA listened to the Pathet Lao radio system during the war, and had detailed information about live POWs in Laos. (During my trips to Laos during the war, I was personally briefed on this point by the CIA.)  *At the end of the war, the Pathet Lao publicly stated that they would not release the men until they received the money promised in the Nixon reparations letter.  *The Paris negotiations with Vietnam did not include POWs from Laos. The Vietnamese emphasize this point.  *The Pathet Lao never released any POWs directly or explained what happened to the men they held. (A small number of men who were captured in Laos and turned over to Vietnam for detention were released by Vietnam, along with the other POWs.)  In the Spring of 1973, Congress decided not to pay the $3.25 billion President Nixon had committed in his letter.  Watergate was underway, and our government was not functioning well.  In April, 1973, the Defense Department publicly declared that there were no more living Americans being held in Southeast Asia.  *This is the most significant mistake made by our government on the POW/MIA issue.  *This was done at a time when we knew we had left men in Laos (and probably in Cambodia and Vietnam).  .  .  .  Several months ago, I recommended appointing a Presidential negotiator. I urge you to appoint a personal representative to negotiate with the Vietnamese. General Vessey is an excellent choice. He will have my full support.  POW/MIA family members and veterans groups will react positively to this action.  General Vessey must report directly to you -- not to the Secretary of State or the NSC -- if he is to have the status needed to successfully deal with Vietnam.  General Vessey's role cannot be limited to recovering the POW/MIAs and remains. This would make him ineffective with the Vietnamese. His role must be a broad one -- to resolve the outstanding problems with Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  .  .  .  During my meetings with the Vietnamese, I carefully postured the conversations so that the MIAs would be found in Laos and returned by the Loatian government. This approach allows Vietnam to avoid criticism for having held the men.  Information regarding economic conditions in Vietnam and Southeast Asia and other concerns expressed by Vietnam's leaders were conveyed to me during the meetings. This may be helpful to General Vessey. Howard Baker has this information, but I am not including it in this letter in an effort to keep it brief.  .  .  .     Best wishes,  Sincerely,  Ross Perot  Comments on Meetings With Foreign Minister Thach  .  .  .  Several times they commented, ""We won the war and yet you do not treat us with respect."" They feel that we are rude and arrogant in our dealings with them.  They resent the fact that they continue to allow us to come into Vietnam to talk with them about the POW/MIAs, and freely travel throughout their country -- and yet, we do not reciprocate in the U.S. They are subject to a twenty-five mile limit when they visit the UN. (Foreign Minister Thach was particularly sensitive about this subject.)  .  .  .  ""Your government declared your own men dead shortly after the war. How can you expect us to take you seriously about looking for men who may be alive after all these years. Why did your government declare these men dead right after the war?""  The Vietnamese do not trust our government. They pointed out several times that our government has not kept its promises. (It would be possible to get a list of the promises they feel we have not kept.)  The current team negotiating for MIA remains is ineffective. The Vietnamese believe they are minor figures in our government who have no authority, and can only ""make demands.""  .  .  .  The economy is in bad shape. People are hungry. The soldiers are hungry and are not always paid. Corruption is a serious problem.  The Vietnamese openly admit this. It appears to be their number one concern.  *They are reading economics books.  *They know they must change their economy, but they don't know what to do.  *They would welcome our help.  *They are most interested in direct assistance from the private sector, feeling that the private sector knows more about business than the government. (I believe this is their primary interest in me.)  They would like to have an economic representative from Vietnam in the U.S., studying how we do business. (This person could be located in either the Swedish or Swiss Embassy, according to them, and would keep a low profile.)  They would like to be able to have teams come from Vietnam to the U.S. to study specific industries. The Vietnamese economic representative would coordinate these activities.  They would like for the U.S. to have economic representatives living in Vietnam. This group could be operated privately, if the government does not wish to become directly involved. The Vietnamese would prefer to have a private group from the business world, because they would have more practical experience than people from government.  The Vietnamese have studied me in detail.  They say conditions in the South are better than in the North.  These people have a great deal of pride, toughness, and willingness to endure. We must be careful when dealing with them not to underestimate them.  .  .  .  I explained to Thach that it would not be possible for our two countries to work together until the POW/MIA problem was resolved.  *He accepts this, but needs shows of good faith on our part.  .  ..  Thach, who is very shrewd, picked up on Laos right away, saying he was willing to help us in every possible way in Laos. He emphasized that the Paris Treaty did not cover U.S. POWs in Laos. He knew exactly what I was doing in focusing on Laos (giving him a graceful out by having the men come out of Laos.)  He indicated a willingness to have U.S. teams in Hanoi, to conduct a full scale search of their country.  He indicated a willingness to help us establish teams in Laos to conduct searches of Laos.  After returning from this trip, I received word through an intermediary that a senior Pathet Lao government minister wants to meet with me to ""sell some POWs."" I doubt that it resulted from my Hanoi visit. It is a remote possibility, but I will check it out.  LOAD-DATE: July 5, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Text                      ",July 5 1992 ,11
"      The Bush Administration began releasing thousands of classified documents today on Americans still unaccounted for in the Vietnam War.  The start of the declassification of up to 1.3 million documents over the next few months follows an executive order by President Bush on Wednesday to release all P.O.W.-M.I.A material, with certain exceptions, for the first time since American troops returned from Indochina in 1973.  The declassification was requested by the Senate this month by unanimous vote, after the Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. affairs held a series of hearings on assertions that successive administrations had known since the end of the war that Americans had been left behind in Indochina.  ""We have traveled a 20 years' journey in the space of nine months,"" Senator John F. Kerry, chairman of the committee, said as he welcomed the release of the documents today.  The committee will hold public hearings on this issue on Aug. 4 and 5. Senator Kerry cautioned families today that these live-sighting reports have to be considered in context, since many have been discredited.  Mr. Kerry also announced today that Ross Perot had agreed to testify before the committee on Aug. 11. Mr. Perot, who had taken an active part in searching for lost Americans and had made a private trip to Hanoi to meet the Vietnamese authorities, had declined to appear publicly while he was still contemplating a Presidential race.

"      Pentagon investigations into its own handling of the issue of Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War found a pattern of mismanaged files and overworked officials more often motivated to dispose of cases than to pursue and analyze them, newly released documents show.  Documents released Thursday under an executive order from President Bush generally called into question the Pentagon's commitment to investigate thoroughly all reports of ""live sightings"" of Americans who may have been left behind in captivity in Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia when American forces were withdrawn in 1973.  Officials in the Defense Department -- where the office dealing with P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs has recently been enlarged and upgraded under a new Assistant Secretary of Defense, Alan Ptak -- now acknowledge that the attitude of those responsible for investigating the cases of the missing and for dealing with relatives contributed to the growth of conspiracy theories and lobbies of disaffected families who no longer believe anything they are told by the Government, like those who heckled President Bush on Friday not far from the Pentagon.  ""There exists a mindset to debunk,"" said a 1986 report prepared by a Pentagon team led by Col. Kimball M. Gaines of the Air Force. ""Intense effort is initially focused on veracity of sources with a view toward discrediting them. This penchant has overridden the seeking of the corroborative data necessary to support the sighting.""  In the same year, another task force headed by Lieut. Gen. Eugene Tighe, also of the Air Force, found that there was some evidence to support the belief that Americans might still be alive in captivity.  ""There is information, even in our limited sample, which establishes the strong possibility of American prisoners of war being held in Laos and Vietnam,"" the Tighe report said.  Memorandums recently declassified show that the word ""possibility"" had replaced ""probability"" between drafts of the document.  Pentagon officials said today that they were still examining 109 cases of ""live sightings"" of Americans, 62 of them reported to be still in captivity. More than 1,800 other such files were declassified this week.  Vietnam denies that it holds any live Americans, as does the Laotian Government. No missing Americans are believed to be in Cambodia.  The Gaines and Tighe reports are among seven internal Pentagon investigative reports and memorandums declassified this week along with several thousand other documents, the first batch of more than 1.3 million papers on the subject to be released over the next few months by the Pentagon.  Under President Bush's order, signed Wednesday, documents are also being released by the White House and the National Security Council.  The release follows a Senate request to the Administration to open all files on the issue for the first time since the withdrawal of American forces from Indochina. Hearings by the Senate Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, which initiated the request, have elicited testimony from several high-ranking officials that 244 Americans on Washington's prisoner of war list were not returned by the Vietnamese in a prisoner exchange program in 1973.  Another major element in the documents released on Friday are 1,800 ""live sighting"" reports. Despite some of the conclusions reached in internal inquiries, an examination of some of those reports showed that the Defense Department often went to exhaustive lengths to verify information it had received describing the events of many years before.  One case cited information from ""source 1542,"" described as a Vietnamese who had passed two polygraph tests. The Defense Intelligence Agency assessed his allegation of having sighted ""a group of Caucasians"" in 1978 and again in 1982 in what he called a prison in Hanoi. He said friends had described those people to him as Americans.  Using photographic evidence and interviews with other Vietnamese, Pentagon aides concluded that ""Source 1542 described seeing American prisoners at a prison that did not exist.""

"     After the War Was Over Hanoi and Saigon By Neil Sheehan Illustrated. 131 pages. Random House. $17.  You don't know quite what to expect at the opening of Neil Sheehan's enlightening report, ""After the War Was Over: Hanoi and Saigon,"" when he describes landing at Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi in 1989.  In his previous writings, Mr. Sheehan has described himself as an avid supporter of United States policy in Vietnam when he first went there in 1962 as a 25-year-old reporter for United Press International. But in time he grew disillusioned with what he came to see as the major tragedy of his generation, so much so that in 1971, when he was working for The New York Times, he obtained the official secret archive of the war known as the Pentagon Papers.  Between 1971 and 1989 he wrote ""A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam,"" an award-winning account of the war as seen through the eyes of the battle commander whom Mr. Sheehan regarded as the personification of the American venture in Vietnam. After ""A Bright Shining Lie"" was published, Mr. Sheehan felt at peace with himself and was eager to return to Vietnam with his wife, the journalist Susan Sheehan, and see the country that had so long been the object of his obsessions, now that it was also at peace.  Yet one's curiosity over what his return will be like is resolved with dramatic suddenness. Almost the first person he and his wife got to see was Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, and the very occurrence of their meeting with the 79-year-old victor of Dien Bien Phu as well as the content of their conversation with him sets the tone for what is to come in Mr. Sheehan's mesmerizing report.  First, there is the surprising fact of General Giap's accessibility. This indicated the willingness of the Vietnamese to show the Sheehans whatever they wished to see, whether it was a battle site, a factory or an individual and whether what they saw reflected positively or negatively on the Vietnamese struggle to consolidate their victory in the war.  Then there is the combination of pride and humility displayed by this living icon of Vietnamese history. In 1982, General Giap was forced out of the Politburo, the executive body of the Vietnamese Communist Party, after clashing with Le Duan, the Brezhnev-like general secretary of the party who has been blamed for the economic mistakes and political dogmatism of the first decade after American troops left. Yet even though General Giap suffered the humiliation of being forced to stand behind the editor of the party newspaper on formal occasions when protocol ruled, ""there was a limit to how much such slights could hurt this man,"" Mr. Sheehan writes. ""He knew who he was and what he had done, and no one could take that away from him.""  Similarly, many of the people whom the Sheehans interviewed seem indifferent to matters of pride or humiliation. Among the most interesting of these is Nguyen Van Linh, the present general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, who survived 12 years of French prisons, 30 years of war and manhunts in the South, and a decade of internecine political struggle after the Communist victory in 1975 before he eventually took over the leadership of his country in 1985 and started it down a new path toward partial capitalism after his predecessor, Le Duan, had failed to build the ideal Communist society. There is also Ly Tong Ba, a general in command of a South Vietnamese infantry division when the Government of President Le Duc Thieu finally fell in 1975, who fully expected to be executed by the Communists but who survived 12 years of prison and ""re-education.""  But what impresses the reader most about General Giap's demeanor is his lack of bitterness or animosity, particularly toward Americans. This too was reflected everywhere the Sheehans went in Vietnam. People even looked ahead to a time when the American economic boycott would end and diplomatic relations would resume. Mr. Sheehan writes that the Vietnamese ""see an American diplomatic and business presence as a political counterpoise to China and an economic counterpoise to Japan.""  The Communists did not impose the much-feared blood bath on their defeated opponents. In fact, the people who suffered the most, many of them expelled from the country and perishing at sea as boat people, were the Chinese minority in Vietnam, who were feared as a potential fifth column for Beijing. And this can be seen as the final paradox of America's involvement in the war, considering that its policy was based on an assumption that if South Vietnam was defeated by the North, it would be the first of a series of dominoes toppling over in the path of a monolithic Communist juggernaut led by China.  Mr. Sheehan's book, portions of which originally appeared in different form in The New Yorker, finally adds up to a view of the struggle with the United States from the enemy's perspective. Mr. Sheehan reports that back in 1963, Ho Chi Minh predicted that Americans would behave differently from the French. ""Neither you nor I knows the Americans well,"" Ho told a visiting Polish diplomat, ""but what we do know of them, what we have read and heard about them, suggests that they are more practical and clearsighted than other capitalist nations. They will not pour their resources into Vietnam endlessly. One day they will take pencil in hand and begin figuring. Once they really begin to analyze our ideas seriously, they will come to the conclusion that it is possible and even worthwhile to live in peace with us.""  But Ho turned out to be wrong. As Mr. Sheehan writes, the Americans proved different from the French only in the degree of arrogance ""in the hubris of our moment in the sun."" So the Vietnamese rolled up their sleeves and fought the American forces until they left. It was, as Mr. Sheehan's report makes luminously clear, simply another task in their centuries-old struggle for independence.

"      The Pentagon said today that Hanoi had begun to put new obstacles in the way of resolving more quickly the cases of American servicemen still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.  The two countries had just begun to make significant progress on the issue, which is blocking the normalization of relations and the lifting of an American economic embargo. Joint American-Vietnamese teams have been excavating crash sites and conducting interviews in wide areas of Vietnam.  ""The train is fast coming to a halt,"" Col. John Cole, chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency's office in Bangkok, told the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs near the end of two days of testimony on the most emotional aspect of the issue, the reports of live sightings. ""The Vietnamese are beginning to change the rules.""  The Pentagon says it has 110 unresolved, first-hand reports from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos of sightings of Americans covering nearly 19 years since United States forces were withdrawn from Indochina and Hanoi said all prisoners had been returned. The Defense Department lists 2,266 Americans still unaccounted for in Indochina, although half of them are assumed to have died.  Colonel Cole told the committee that in a meeting a week ago, Hanoi demanded full files from the United States on reports by people who claim to have seen Americans, including information on sources. Vietnam would then decide which cases to investigate.  Senior Defense Intelligence Agency officials testifying before the committee said the United States would not jeopardize sources by complying with the request. Vietnam has also denied that it ever offered free access to prisons in the search for Americans.  In testimony, officials acknowledged that they had not asked for access to a Vietnamese Defense Ministry compound in Hanoi that has been the source of persistent rumors and refugee accounts of an underground prison housing foreigners.  Today, a brief confrontation erupted between the committee and the defense intelligence officials, led by Robert Sheetz, chief of the Pentagon's Special Office for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, when it was determined that nine photographs of the Hanoi site, known since French colonial days as the Citadel, had been reversed in printing -- the equivalent of viewing a slide backward in a projector -- before being turned over for exhibition in the hearing room, making sites difficult to identify.  The committee's vice chairman, Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, challenged the intelligence agency to prove that it had not been confusing informers by showing them similarly reversed pictures of the Citadel site. Mr. Sheetz apologized and said there had been no intention to deceive.  Might Be Non-Americans  Reports of sightings, the majority of them later proved to be false, have played a large part in creating accusations of Government conspiracies among groups lobbying for the prisoners of war and those missing in action. Defense intelligence officials reiterated today that they believed that most of the sightings are of Russians or Europeans or Cubans working in Indochina.  But committee members said that as long as Laos and Vietnam barred American teams from areas that have generated some of the more credible reports, the sense of cover-up would grow, despite stepped up efforts by the Defense Department to narrow the list of the missing considerably.  Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the committee, asked today that officials and relatives of the missing consider the plight of Vietnam, where officials cannot be expected to open their most sensitive files and sites to the American military and where the bureaucracy can stall even the most well intended plan.  On the other hand, giving the Vietnamese more time and information on sites to be studied, Senator Kerry said, only increases the chances that lobby groups will find investigations unsatisfactory because they will believe prisoners were quickly moved by Hanoi.

"    Charging that the United States is making ""excessive"" demands in its search for servicemen still unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, Hanoi's chief delegate to the United Nations said yesterday that the Vietnamese had begun to fear that American inspections of prisons and archives are cloaks for espionage.  ""It seems that the intention of the U.S. side is not only seeking M.I.A. information, but also seeking something else -- for example, information on the internal situation of Vietnam, state secrets of Vietnam,"" said Trinh Xuan Lang, Hanoi's top envoy in the United States in the absence of diplomatic relations.  Mr. Lang said in an interview at his Manhattan residence that his remarks reflected public opinion in Vietnam.  But Americans who have close ties to Hanoi through private organizations say officials in some ministries and a faction of the Communist Party leadership wary of American influence have used what they consider the intrusiveness of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue to justify and promote their hard-line positions, which are not shared by the general public.  Mr. Lang said that of particular concern to officials in Hanoi were repeated requests for ""short notice"" searches of prisons and sites to follow up reports that Caucasians believed to be Americans had been spotted alive.  He said that under new agreements reached this year with President Bush's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey, and the former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, Richard Solomon, Hanoi had joined in 35 live-sighting searches, including 6 on short notice and 5 in prisons.  ""All those investigations have proved that all the information on live sightings given by the U.S. side was inaccurate, incorrect, false,"" he said.  Mr. Lang's comments reflect Hanoi's exasperation that progress toward the establishment of relations with the United States, which would unlock the door to American investment and participation in development, has been set back over the last few months by a series of events.  These include still-unproven Russian allegations that Vietnam may have held Americans after the United States troop withdrawal in 1973 and may have turned over some to Moscow.  Mr. Lang implied that President Boris N. Yeltsin's statements in June that Vietnam veterans could still be alive in the former Soviet republics could have been made for political reasons.  ""The M.I.A. issue is a very emotional, sensitive and complex issue,"" he said. ""Nobody should be allowed to use that issue for his own profit because it would affect the sentiments of the American people as well as the Vietnamese people.""  Hearings by the Senate Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs have also served to reopen the issue to Hanoi's disadvantage.  Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire and the committee's deputy chairman, publicly repeated his belief in hearings last week that Hanoi had maintained an underground prison in a Defense Ministry compound near the mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh. Mr. Lang called the charge ""a myth and an affront to the people of Vietnam.""  At a recent technical meeting between the leaders of the joint search operations, Mr. Lang edged, Vietnam put forward what he called ""suggestions"" on how future searches, particularly in live-sighting cases, should be conducted.  He said Hanoi had no intention of withdrawing cooperation, but was asking only to be involved in deciding on the merits of cases before searches were ordered. He did seem to all but rule out short-notice investigations, however.  Pentagon and State Department officials want to continue the practice to avoid criticism that potential evidence can be moved out of the way if the Vietnamese have days or weeks to get ready for an inspection.  ""Relations between our two countries have been taken hostage in the hands of some strong M.I.A. lobbies,"" he said. ""So it is up to the lobbyists whether the United States and Vietnam have relations or not. That cannot be accepted.""

"      Documents being released by the Pentagon show that Laos has been a persistent focus of attention and frustration through nearly two decades of investigation of Americans still missing from the Vietnam War.  The documents also disclose that a lengthening list of officials in Richard M. Nixon's Administration believed that as many as several hundred people were missing when the war-time prisoner exchange ended in 1973.  On Tuesday, Ross Perot, who is among those who have asserted that Laos is withholding information, will testify before the committee.  Mr. Perot, a Texas businessman who has pursued a Presidential nomination, made several trips to Southeast Asia to look for prisoners, the first in 1969 and the last in 1987, after which he wrote to President Ronald Reagan, ""The evidence that men were held in Laos is substantial.""  Some such evidence is summarized in a bleak memorandum written in March 1973 by Lawrence S. Eagleburger, then Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense, to Defense Secretary Elliot L. Richardson. The memo was released by the Pentagon in July.  Mr. Eagleburger, writing that the Defense Intelligence Agency had listed 350 Americans, civilian and military, as missing in Laos, reported that the Ambassador in Laos, McMurtrie Godley, had been instructed to press the Soviet Ambassador to win cooperation from the Lao Patriotic Front, the governing coalition. Mr. Godley is also to testify Tuesday.  The Lao Patriotic Front was later forced to cede all power to its Communist contingent, the Pathet Lao, which had both Soviet and North Vietnamese support. Hanoi controlled significant areas of Laos during and after the war.  ""After the recovery of the last prisoners from NVN,"" Mr. Eagleburger wrote in March 1973, referring to North Vietnam, ""Hanoi should be advised unequivocally that we still hold them responsible for the return of all P.O.W.'s being held in Indochina.""  Mr. Eagleburger suggested steps that could be taken to intimidate the Laotians and Vietnamese into cooperating, culminating in air strikes ""as a last resort.""  The gist of that memo was passed on by Mr. Richardson to Henry A. Kissinger, President Nixon's national security adviser, later the same month.  By the end of 1973, however, Congress had cut off all money for operations in Indochina and Hanoi had begun its two-year assault on the South in defiance of the Paris peace accord, ending with the fall of Saigon.  Because the United States did not send ground troops into Laos, which was technically neutral, nearly all the Americans lost there were crewmen on bombing or reconnaissance flights. In a significant number of cases, American officials knew exactly where a plane had been shot down or crashed, and that one or more crewman may have survived. When these aviators were not returned, questions were raised that have not been answered.  Similar questions surround at least 133 servicemen who Washington was certain were prisoners of war in Vietnam but who were not freed by Hanoi.  There have been recurrent allegations that Hanoi was holding Americans as ransom against war reparations of $3 billion to $4 billion that the North Vietnamese say they were promised by President Nixon.  Two newspapers, The Washington Times and The San Diego Union Tribune, have published articles based on Senate committee documents that purport to show that as recently as 1981, the Reagan Administration received an offer of the release of prisoners by Hanoi in return for $4 billion. The reports drew on closed-door testimony given in July by Richard V. Allen, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser.  In an interview today, Mr. Allen said that he had only a ""distant recollection"" of a discussion on a Hanoi deal for prisoners, but that in retrospect he thinks that the conversation was not in 1981, as his deposition said, but in 1986, after he had left Government.  He said he generally approved of trying to make a deal with Hanoi if the offer were real, not with Government officials but with members of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. lobby.

"      Three top Reagan Administration officials responsible for tracking the cases of United States servicemen missing in Vietnam said today that the Government had known for nearly 20 years that some American prisoners of war may have been alive in Indochina when troops were withdrawn in 1973.  But in testimony to the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs the three officials expressed doubts that any prisoners remained alive in captivity now.  U.S. Lost Its Chance  The officials, part of an Administration that sought to focus new attention on the issue in the 1980's, testified that they had always assumed that there were American prisoners of war alive in Indochina in 1973. They also charged that the United States lost its best chance of finding out what happened to all unaccounted-for Americans by not pressing the issue forcefully in the years immediately after its withdrawal from Indochina.  ""In the period when the trail was hot, when there should have been a full-court press, the effort was less, not more,"" Lieut. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency from 1985 to 1988, told the committee. He was referring to the Administrations of Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.  The others who testified today were Richard T. Childress, a staff member on President Reagan's National Security Council, and Richard Armitage, a former Assistant Defense Secretary.  But officials of previous Administrations insist they did all they could to ascertain the status of American servicemen missing in Vietnam in the early 1970's, and they deny they were negligent in any way. [Page A6.]  In recent weeks, in many hours of testimony and through the declassification of more than a million Pentagon and White House documents now making their way into the public domain, the Senate committee has been developing a fuller account of the Government's handling of the missing servicemen.  But the picture still remains incomplete, and there is contradictory evidence. Despite the contradictions, what is gradually emerging, in the view of many members of the committee, are new details on nearly two decades of United States and Vietnamese actions and contacts giving greater credence to the claims of the families of missing Americans.  The United States lists 2,266 Americans as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War. About half of these are known to have died, but their remains have not been recovered. Of the rest, 130 to 135 fall into the category of prisoners who may have been alive in captivity in 1973, according to Defense Department officials and investigations by the Senate committee drawing on information about these servicemen's last known whereabouts.  It is this group that has become the focus of a new investigation into the issue of the missing. The status of the others is unknown, and they are listed as missing in action.  Over the years, many officials have suggested that there were American servicemen unaccounted for in Indochina, many of them pilots shot down during the war. But the statements today represented an unusual public confirmation at a time when the issue has re-emerged.  The issue of the missing has now been split effectively into two questions: how many people where unaccounted for in 1973, when American troops came home, and how many of this number might be living Americans who survived in captivity after that.  Several officials involved in accounting in the Nixon years have testified that while they knew prisoners had not returned as expected, they assumed virtually all had died at some point in captivity, although Vietnamese, Laotian and Cambodian officials never explained why they were not returned. Other officials disagree, saying that they believed prisoners did survive, though only one, Robert Garwood, a Marine, later came home.  Allusion to Vietnam Offer  Mr. Childress raised the possibility in testimony today that Americans may have survived into the 1980's when he alluded to an offer said to have been made by Vietnam through a third country for the release of Americans in return for development aid. Mr. Childress said that the offer was ""followed back to Vietnam "" in the mid-1980's, but that there were no prisoners.  The committee chairman, Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, cut off further discussion of Mr. Childress's assertions and said the panel would hear the details in closed session.  This was the second report the committee had received of purported approaches by Vietnam in the 1980's through intermediary countries, suggesting the exchange of prisoners for money or pledges of aid.  A former State Department official close to the issue said in an interview today that offers like these have been appearing since the 1960's. All of them have been proved fraudulent, he said.  Hanoi Says All Returned  Vietnam has always insisted it returned all prisoners in 1973. It has returned several hundred sets of remains since then.  In a summing up of recent testimony on Government actions on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue and the private interventions of Ross Perot, who made several trips to Indochina in search of information on the missing, Senator Kerry said that ""there is really no mystery about where this cry of conspiracy comes from.""  ""This issue that has haunted America for 20 years has not haunted it falsely,"" he said, after General Perroots, Mr. Childress and Mr. Armitage, who now heads the relief program for the ex-Soviet republics, all said that there had been no full accounting for servicemen in 1973 and that there has still been no full accounting today.  In a key exchange, Senator Kerry said, ""So if it's true that we do not have a full accounting as we sit here today in 1992, it has to be equally as true that we did not have a full accounting in 1973 when we left Vietnam; is that true?"" All three officials agreed.  They added that they had been saying this for years, in meetings and speeches to family groups. They welcomed the declassification of documents, saying that secrecy had only contributed to allegations of cover-ups from the P.O.W.-M.I.A. lobby and accusations from others that the issue of the missing was a political campaign without foundation in fact.  Henry A. Kissinger, who was President Nixon's national security adviser in 1973, said Tuesday on the ABC News program ""Nightline"" that he had never been satisfied with Vietnam's accounting for the missing, although President Nixon announced on March 29 of that year that all prisoners were home. In ""Years of Upheaval,"" his memoirs covering that period, Mr. Kissinger wrote of taking 80 names of missing Americans to Indochina in the the summer of 1973 to ask officials to account for them.  In several months of testimony and extensive investigation, the Senate Select Committee has produced a list of 133 names of people who were reliably reported to be in captivity in Vietnam or Laos in 1973, but who did not come home in prisoner exchanges.  The Defense Department has a similar list of 135 ""discrepancy cases,"" where there is enough information about the last known location of apparently live Americans to suggest that Hanoi knows what happened to them.  ""Vietnam can easily account for hundreds of Americans,"" Mr. Childress, who made a number of trips to Hanoi in the 1980's, told the committee today. He added that he believed there were ""elements in the politburo"" who had decided not to cooperate more.  Mr. Armitage, a fluent Vietnamese speaker who spent four years in South Vietnam during the war and also led delegations to Hanoi, said that to make headway on the resolution of cases believed to be soluble, ""the Governments of Vietnam and Laos, and what passes for the Government of Cambodia, will have to open up and give us full access to their records.""  Unanswered questions about the missing are the chief reason Washington has not normalized relations with Vietnam or lifted an economic embargo against Hanoi.  The three Reagan Administration officials said they had no hard evidence that Americans remained alive in Indochina now, but all added that they believed it was possible. They said some servicemen might have stayed behind of their own volition and could account for some if not all of the live sightings of people identified as Americans in recent years.  ""I don't think there's an organized, institutionalized effort to hold a lot of people,"" said General Perroots.  Mr. Armitage said: ""There are Americans in Indochina. I don't know the circumstances. They may be living freely.""  The officials said there had been no conspiracy by the Government to cover up evidence of living Americans. But General Perroots said there were times when the Government should have worked harder to resolve the question of the missing.  The Reagan Administration years were critical to the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue because the White House gave considerable encouragement to family groups and other lobbyists who sought to give the problem a high political profile.  Critics of the policy say that the Reagan Administration raised false hopes, while actually doing little to solve the problem.  As the committee's work has clarified some questions, it has also produced new conflicting accounts. On Tuesday, for example, Mr. Perot and McMurtrie Godley, a former United States Ambassador to Laos, presented diametrically opposed accounts of a briefing for Mr. Perot at the United States Embassy in Vientiane in 1970. Both were under oath. Today in closed session, the Central Intelligence Agency station chief in Laos at the time was reported to have supported the Ambassador's recollections.  Though Mr. Armitage and Mr. Perot both say they believe that prisoners remained in Indochina when the United States withdrew its troops, they have disagreed over whether Americans are still in captivity. Mr. Perot, who takes the position that many Americans are still prisoners, has waged a campaign to discredit Mr. Armitage and his handling of the issue during the Reagan years.

"      Former American officials insist they did all they could to ascertain the status of American servicemen missing in Vietnam in the early 1970's, and they deny they were negligent in any way.  Moreover, the former officials said they did not knowingly abandoned any American servicemen who fought in Indochina.  The comments came in response to Congressional testimony this week suggesting that American prisoners of war may have been left behind in Vietnam after American forces withdrew in 1973.  In an address to the nation on March 29, 1973, President Richard M. Nixon said, ""All of our American P.O.W.'s are on their way home.""  The former officials said today that they gave Vietnam large amounts of information about the last known whereabouts of missing American servicemen, in the hope that Vietnam would provide the fullest possible accounting of the missing men.  Now, those officials say, their efforts are being misinterpreted to suggest that the United States Government knew some of the servicemen were still alive in captivity in the early 1970's.  Putting Pressure on Hanoi  Frank A. Sieverts, a former State Department official who worked on the issue from 1966 to 1978, said that in supplying information about American servicemen to Hanoi, ""we would shade the interpretation of cases and lists in a favorable direction, in the direction of saying, 'We know you have more information.' ""  In dealing with the Vietnamese, American officials say they operated on the assumption that the missing servicemen were alive, and they tried to convey that impression to the Vietnamese, because they wanted to put pressure on Hanoi to locate and return the Americans.  But that approach seems to have raised false hopes among relatives of the missing servicemen, the officials now say. ""The difficulty,"" Mr. Sieverts said, ""was that if you overstated that assumption for a domestic audience, you would create what was clearly an exaggerated and possibly an entirely false hope among the families, among many thousands of Americans who needed to deal suddenly with the reality and the grief that their men weren't coming back.""  Henry A. Kissinger, who was President Nixon's national security adviser and then Secretary of State, dismissed the idea that American officials knowingly allowed American servicemen to remain in Vietnam after the signing of the Paris peace accords in January 1973.  ""It is an outrage to suggest that we would knowingly leave Americans in the hands of the Communists.,"" Mr. Kissinger said Tuesday on the ABC News program ""Nightline.""  Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of P.O.W./M.I.A. Families, welcomed today's testimony by Reagan Administration officials.  ""From 1973 to 1981, successive administrations and the American body politic ignored substantive information that there were Americans last known to be alive in captivity who did not return from the Vietnam War,"" Mrs. Griffiths said.

"      On the evening of March 29, 1973, President Richard M. Nixon, eager to put the Vietnam War behind him, told a national television and radio audience that the time had come to bring down the curtain on the Vietnam experience.  ""Tonight, the day we have all worked and prayed for has finally come,"" he said. ""For the first time in 12 years, no American military forces are in Vietnam. All our American P.O.W.'s are on their way home.""  For some who served -- and who waited -- the words rang hollow the moment they were uttered. Neither statement was true: American forces, some of them suddenly metamorphosed into civilian advisers, had remained behind in Indochina. And, as newly released documents are now confirming, Administration officials knew that not all the prisoners had returned when the last of 591 men came home that week.   'Not Reading the Reports'  ""We sat around and laughed,"" John F. King, an Army intelligence specialist at the time, recalled in an interview today. ""We said, 'Hey, he's not reading the reports we're sending him.' ""  Mr. King, now director of public affairs for the Vietnam Veterans of America, was on a team assigned to interview a small group of returning prisoners of war, he said. But when Operation Homecoming was over, only one of the men on his list came back.  The spring of 1973 was neither the beginning nor the end of the bitter P.O.W-M.I.A. story, which is now woven into the politics of both the United States and Vietnam and which has become the last hurdle to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Hanoi.  A Lack of Trust  ""We have to trust each other,"" Trinh Xuan Lang, Vietnam's chief delegate to the United Nations, said in an interview last week. But American demands on Hanoi, he said, ""prove there is no trust.""  American officials also have doubts.  ""We recognized from the outset that reopening negotiations with Vietnam was a potential minefield,"" Richard T. Childress, formerly of the National Security Council, told the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs on Wednesday, as he recalled the Reagan Administration's efforts to restart talks in the early 1980's after a period of silence.  ""Given my experience,"" he said, ""we should never take Vietnamese pledges, promises or excuses at face value.""  Hanoi and Washington began talking about prisoners in the 1966, a year after American ground troops were introduced into Vietnam.  In 1973, the year the United States withdrew from the war after the Paris peace accords and prisoner exchanges were carried out, the Nixon Administration quickly lost what little opportunity or will it had to pursue the issue of prisoners who did not return.  Officials who worked on the issue during that period have tried to recreate in Senate committee hearings over the last few months a sense of that turbulent period, when Americans wanted to put a divisive war behind them, and when the Nixon Administration was headed into the vortex of the Watergate scandal.  There were a few abortive suggestions that Washington threaten to restart the war if Hanoi, then moving forces into South Vietnam, did not live up to its peace treaty pledges to honor Saigon's independence and give a fuller accounting of the American dead and missing. But Congress would not condone military action, nor would it agree to pay Hanoi any of the $3.25 billion in reconstruction aid the Vietnamese say they were promised; Washington regarded it as a proposal.  ""By the end of April 1973, therefore, our strategy for Vietnam was in tatters,"" Henry A. Kissinger, Mr. Nixon's national security adviser, wrote in his memoirs, ""Years of Upheaval.""  Lobbies were forming on behalf of the missing, led by the National League of Families.  Ann Mills Griffiths, the executive director of the League, said its early activities included demonstrations and filing suit to stop the Pentagon from making an automatic ""presumption of death"" judgment in missing cases. Later, Mrs. Griffiths would serve as a representative of families on many negotiating trips to Hanoi.  She says she observed a pattern in Hanoi's tactics in which talks would move forward, and then suddenly stall.  During the Administration of President Gerald Ford, the issue of the missing was more or less put on hold.  Approach by Carter  When President Jimmy Carter took office, a new approach was made to Hanoi. The United States moved toward establishing relations, on the theory that the job of looking for any Americans who may have remained in Vietnam would be easier in a better climate that provided wider access to the Vietnamese countryside.  The first of a series of reports on the prisoner-missing issue had been released around the time of Mr. Carter's election. The report, prepared by the House Select Committee on Missing Persons in Southeast Asia, under the chairmanship of Representative G. V. Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, concluded that no Americans were held alive as prisoners in Indochina, but that a partial accounting of the missing was possible.  Those conclusions have been supported by many officials and subsequent commissions, though not by many family members.  President Carter's efforts to open links to Hanoi were thwarted by Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1978.  In the late 1980's, the prisoner-missing issue picked up steam in the United States as President Ronald Reagan vowed to make an accounting a ""national priority.""  Since 1982, the Administrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush pursued a policy of regular contacts with Hanoi, sending delegations to seek resolution of at least some of the 2,266 cases of people unaccounted for since the war. In more than half these cases, servicemen are assumed to have died, but their bodies have not been recovered.  In 1987, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was appointed a special presidential envoy to Hanoi. He has been urging the Vietnamese to open their archives to help solve about 135 ""discrepancy cases,"" where American officials are convinced by the information they have that Hanoi must know what happened to the servicemen involved.  In 1991, Hanoi, still hoping for an American embassy, allowed the United States to open a P.O.W.-M.I.A. office.  Americans insist that Vietnam can do more to resolve the discrepancy cases, thereby moving the stalled talks on normalizing relations farther along a hypothetical ""road map"" devised by the State Department.

"     AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER Hanoi and Saigon. By Neil Sheehan. 131 pp. New York: Random House. $17.  IN 1989 Neil Sheehan, a former correspondent in Vietnam for United Press International and The New York Times, returned to the scenes of his youth, of his generation's war and of the reportage that became his life's work. ""After the War Was Over"" is the result of that journey. This political travelogue deals with the question that occurs so easily to all who visit Vietnam now, but that American leaders of the 1960's apparently could not begin to formulate: ""Why in the name of God had we bombed a country as poor as this?""  The poverty, exacerbated by American bombing and now partly maintained by the postwar American economic embargo, is everywhere present in this work, from rat-infested hotel rooms to a filthy Hanoi hospital where the life of a child was lost for lack of an antibiotic readily available at American drugstores.  The Vietnamese Mr. Sheehan interviewed are presented as people as forgiving as they were fierce. As examples of dedication to the common good, they are sharply at odds with the current conception of ""Communist"" as a synonym for ""corrupt.""  The most interesting of them is Nguyen Van Linh, who in 1989 was the general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party. He is a man who survived 12 years in a French prison, 30 years of war and a decade of political infighting to push his country toward economic liberalization and away from the grayness imposed by his Stalinist comrades.  Mr. Linh, whose Communism is based more on ""Les Miserables"" than on ""Das Kapital,"" achieved a degree of reform, he told Mr. Sheehan, by applying the lessons learned in the jungle fighting Americans. ""My comrades and I could not afford to be subjective in our conclusions,"" he said. ""Had we been subjective, we would immediately have been crushed by reality. So I continued to think according to that pattern when I shifted to peaceful restructuring."" Mr. Sheehan contrasts this with the illusions on which John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson based their war policy, primarily the belief that Ho Chi Minh and his associates, heirs to a thousand-year tradition of anti-Chinese nationalism, were pawns of the Chinese.  ""After the War Was Over"" serves as an afterword to the author's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Bright Shining Lie"" and will probably be most appreciated by readers of that book. Mr. Sheehan revisits the battlegrounds of the war and finds them filled with optimistic people, along with the ""American grass"" that the Vietnamese believe was deliberately seeded by the United States to provide a combustible material for additional waves of napalm.  To his surprise, Mr. Sheehan discovers an absence of animosity toward the United States. In a country now finally, truly undergoing Vietnamization, buildings are kept in readiness for the return of American officials.  As a Hanoi doctor said of the 19th-century microscope still used at his hospital, ""After the War Was Over"" helps us ""see a little better than with our eyes.""    WAITING FOR THE RATS  ""The Hotel Metropole . . . was 'le dernier salon ou l'on cause,' the last really fashionable place in Hanoi,"" [Bernard] Fall had written of his Hanoi of the 1950's. . . . When I walked up the front steps . . . past Grecian columns of peeling white paint, and pushed on the revolving door at the entrance, it turned grudgingly. The explanation was not in the heaviness of the once-handsome door: almost everything in Hanoi has been running down since 1939. The spindle on which the revolving door turned was worn out. Decades of guests coming and going, grinding grit underfoot, had also created dips in the marble of the entrance steps and the floor of the lobby. We went up to the room assigned to us on the third floor. It was large and held two old wooden beds with mosquito netting. . . . Because I had stayed in rooms like it elsewhere in Asia during my young reportorial years, I could almost see the rats, even though I knew they probably would not come out until after dark. (An Australian friend stayed at the [Metropole] with his son and daughter while we were in Hanoi. His son lost a large part of a sock to the rats one night, and his daughter was afraid to get out of bed to take a bath because the rats made so much noise gamboling about the room.) -- From ""After the War Was Over.""

"    The reason for all the theories that American prisoners of war remain alive in Indochina, almost two decades after the end of the Vietnam War, now becomes painfully clear. From 1973 on, official Washington misrepresented what it knew and shrugged off new leads, betraying its obligations to the families of the missing and to the public at large.  Even now, as a Senate select committee pursues its careful investigations, the White House has yet to offer any explanation or apology for the deceptions of Administrations past. The Vietnam syndrome cannot be declared properly buried until the executive branch itself sets the record straight on those missing in action, the M.I.A.'s.  It is too much to expect a resolution of every single case. That has not been possible in any war, and too much time has now gone by.  But it's hard to justify the Nixon Administration's public closing of this issue while the trail was still hot. In 1973, when Hanoi returned 591 American prisoners of war, the Pentagon's own records showed that hundreds more Americans had survived capture and were quite possibly still alive. Even so, the Nixon Administration proclaimed that all prisoners had been returned, thus reducing any incentive for Hanoi to pursue the remaining cases.  Some of the Americans probably died in captivity. But others were held in Laos, possibly captured while carrying out secret missions. And still others might have been held by local authorities, without direct knowledge by Hanoi.  The Senate committee began piecing this story together several weeks ago. Last week, former Reagan Administration officials offered additional evidence suggesting that some captives may indeed have remained alive years after the war. Ross Perot's long-awaited testimony, meanwhile, proved disappointingly vague and unsubstantiated.  By careful comparison of government records, the committee continues to refine its estimates of captives alive in 1973 -- more than 100, it now seems. It pursues leads from the former Soviet Union. And it usefully presses Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to cooperate. Its efforts are likely to produce the first credible accounting of M.I.A.'s since the war.  George Bush is not to blame for his predecessors' mishandling of the issue. But he has in fact been closely involved with government decision-making in this area for most of the 19 years since U.S. troops left Vietnam. The damaged credibility of the executive branch requires the President to address the issue himself.

"    To the Editor:  President Bush in his address to the American Legion (front page, Aug. 26) vowed that we would not recognize the Vietnamese Government and exchange diplomats until the prisoner of war-missing in action issue has been resolved. If this is an example of his foreign policy expertise, proclaimed as one of his main assets qualifying him for another term, I beg to differ. The opposite seems to me to be indicated.  The fighting in Indochina ended some 20 years ago. No serious student of that war will deny that our involvement in an area we knew so little about was a tragic mistake. It is time our Government leads the American people with the maturity expected from a superpower, admits this and acts accordingly. The first step would be to normalize relations with Hanoi, which would quickly lead to resolution on the prisoners and missing.  Otherwise, it is Washington, rather than Hanoi, that is largely responsible for continuing the trauma of the families who believe that their servicemen are alive in Vietnam. And it is Mr. Bush who must accept his share for the backward way that he has been handling this foreign policy issue.  WALTER A.

"    To the Editor:  In ""What's Still Missing on M.I.A.'s"" (editorial, Aug. 18), you seem surprised that ""official Washington misrepresented what it knew"" about United States forces missing in action in Vietnam in 1973, and that the Government betrayed ""its obligation to the families of the missing and the public at large."" Perhaps the real reason there never has been an explanation or apology on the M.I.A. issue is that our Government has never told the American people the truth about our involvement in Vietnam.  From the beginning, everything about it was a lie: from the fabricated attack on the destroyers Turner Joy and Maddox, which led to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution; through the call to arms to my generation to preserve ""freedom and democracy"" for a Government that jailed citizens who spoke against it; through the term of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who knew in 1965 that the war could not be won, yet continued to order young men and women to Vietnam for three more years until his 1968 resignation; through the infamous Phoenix program, which carried out assassinations of more than 20,000 ""suspected"" Vietcong leaders.  Through Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, who ordered the secret bombing of a neutral Cambodia; through our Government's denial that United States troops were even exposed to chemicals such as Agent Orange and, when that did not work, the claim that the effects of exposure posed no health risks; right up through Ronald Reagan, who as President called America's involvement in Vietnam ""a noble cause.""  There was nothing noble about America's war in Vietnam, in which 58,000 Americans died. More than two million Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians were killed, most of them civilians. The United States officially lists just over 2,000 of its troops missing, but nobody acknowledges the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, Cambodians and Laotians still missing. Millions more were uprooted from their homes and villages, and the countryside throughout the region was virtually destroyed.  Vietnam is not a syndrome that needs to be buried; it is a country struggling to join the community of nations. It is a country that has put the war behind and made friends with thousands of America's Vietnam veterans. It looks forward to the day United States products can be sold in its markets and United States technology becomes part of daily life.  But before this can happen, we must begin speaking the truth and finally put an end to America's ""Vietnam War.""  JOHN F.

"      Nearly 20 years after American troops came home from Vietnam, Roger E. Shields, the Pentagon official in charge of accounting for those who did not return, is still haunted by accusations that the Nixon Administration knowingly left servicemen behind. He is also pained, he says, to see himself quoted as the official who in effect wrote off all the missing as dead.  Mr. Shields, who was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs in 1973, when United States forces were withdrawn from Vietnam, says that Americans will probably never know how many soldiers were alive in Indochina when a prisoner exchange with Hanoi ended that year.  Next week, he will join an array of high-level Nixon Administration officials called to testify before the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs about what they knew at the time of Americans reported as missing in southeast Asia.  On Monday, the committee will question, among others, Melvin R. Laird, Secretary of Defense from 1969-1973; William P. Rogers, Secretary of State in the same years; Vernon A. Walters, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, 1972-76, and Alexander M. Haig, Jr., White House Chief of Staff in 1973-74.  On Tuesday, the committee will devote a full day to Henry A. Kissinger, who was President Richard M. Nixon's national security adviser in 1973. On Thursday, Mr. Shields is due to appear, along with others.  Pentagon View Misinterpreted  In two recent interviews, Mr. Shields said that the Pentagon, contrary to popular belief, never declared that all Americans unaccounted for in prisoner exchanges were dead. He asserted that the Senate committee has used a statement he made on April 12, 1973, out of context.  On that day, Mr. Shields stated in the course of a lengthy news conference: ""We have no indications at this time that there are any Americans alive in Indochina.""  Two weeks earlier, President Nixon had said in a television address to the nation that ""all our American P.O.W.s are on their way home."" Mr. Shields said neither he nor the Pentagon were making that claim, nor were they saying that any Americans who did not return must have perished.  ""What the Defense Department was saying in '73 is not that they were all dead, but that we don't have specific information that that they were alive,"" Mr. Shields said in New York, where he now works in banking. He left government service in 1977.  ""I've spent a large part of my life and put a lot of emotion into this,"" he said. ""It was such an enormous issue and we were dealing with human beings. I knew their wives; I knew their sisters; I knew their brothers."" Though he is years away from direct involvement, Mr. Shields said that he is still invited to weddings and other family events by relatives of the missing.  ""This is why I get so frustrated at being cited saying that they are all dead,"" he said.  Respect of Families  Dolores Apodaca Alfond, head of the National Alliances of Families, which represents relatives of service personnel missing from all wars, said Mr. Shields had won wide respect.  ""Many family members I know appreciated the fact that when they asked questions, he told them the truth,"" she said.  In the interviews, Mr. Shields said all that was known in 1973 was that some Americans who survived the shooting down of planes or other incidents had not been returned or accounted for by Hanoi, the Viet Cong, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia or the Pathet Lao, the Communist movement now in power in Laos.  ""I'd say we expected 30 or 40 more people to come home, maybe up to 50-51,"" Mr. Shields said. He said he shares the view of many who have worked on the issue that Vietnam knew more than it revealed about the fate of at least some of those Americans, and therefore must take some of the responsibility for keeping a lobby of angry families active for more than 20 years.  ""Based on my experience, I felt there had been less than complete candor all along from the Vietnamese and Lao,"" he said.  Stories From Prisoners  Over the years, lists and suspicions grew as Indochinese refugees began to tell stories of captive Americans.  In the summer of 1973, a few months after the end of the prisoner exchange known as Operation Homecoming, Mr. Kissinger presented Hanoi with a list of 80 names on which more information was sought. Mr. Shields said the list included some names the Pentagon was sure Hanoi knew something about, plus a few other cases they could not possibly have accounted for as a ""control group."" But Hanoi never replied, so the test turned out to be useless.  Mr. Shields also said that documents from the period now being released under an executive order by President Bush should be dealt with cautiously. In particular, he discounted a memorandum, signed by Lawrence S. Eagleburger, currently the Acting Secretary of State, who was an Assistant Secretary of Defense at the time. The memo mentioned an unknown number of Americans left in captivity in Laos -- up to 350 servicemen and civilians, according to the Defense Intelligence Agency.  The memo, passed on to Mr. Kissinger by Defense Secretary Elliot L. Richardson, was written not by Mr. Eagleburger but by Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, former desk officer for Laos in the Defense Department and C.I.A., Mr. Shields said. Mr. Secord, the former major general who later played a pivotal role in the Iran-contra affair, was then on Mr. Eagleburger's staff.  Pressuring Laos  ""Eagleburger had just been thrown into this thing at a critical time,"" Mr. Shields said. ""The feeling was that Eagleburger had this memo given to him to sign to say we have to do something to make them perform. We had to hold the Lao responsible.""  Lists and Numbers  The United States lists 2,266 Americans as unaccounted for in Indochina, more than half of whom are assumed to have died but whose bodies have not been found. Some were lost over water and will never be recovered.  Officials have narrowed the list of those whose cases they believe Hanoi can resolve to 135. Seventeen years after the fall of Saigon ended the war in 1975, the issue stills blocks United States recognition of Hanoi and the lifting of a trade embargo.  Mr. Shields does not like lists and numbers.  ""We may never know if we left people behind,"" he said. ""And if we find out that we did, we may never know that the list is complete.""

"      Two former Defense Secretaries in the Nixon Administration said today that they believed in 1973 at the time American forces were being withdrawn from Vietnam that some American prisoners were still in Vietnam and Laos and were not returned by the Communist authorities.  Opening a week of sworn testimony by top Nixon Administration officials before the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, the two Secretaries -- Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger -- said it was common knowledge among officials that Hanoi had not completed its promised accounting for servicemen known to be alive in captivity, but who did not return in prisoner exchanges. [Excerpts, page A6.]  After prolonged negotiations, the United States and North Vietnam signed an agreement in January 1973 to end the Vietnam war. It provided for the release of all Americans held prisoner by Hanoi and for an accounting of those prisoners who had died in captivity. There was no similar agreement with Laos, but the United States at the time expected Hanoi to use its influence to obtain the release of Americans who had been captured in Laos.  Mr. Laird testified that the Pentagon had solid information, such as letters, eyewitness reports or direct radio contact, on about 23 American airmen who survived downings in Laos in 1973 and that he had told Mr. Nixon that. Other officials gave similar accounts of Americans who were known to have been captured and thought to be alive in Vietnam at the end of the war but who were not accounted for in 1973 when Hanoi released its prisoners. However, virtually all of them said they do not think Americans are still in captivity.  Mr. Schlesinger said the Nixon Administration's decision to gloss over or dissemble on the prisoner issue seemed in retrospect to have grown from an assumption ""that the bargaining position of the United States in dealing with Vietnam -- North Vietnam -- was quite weak.""  ""We were anxious to get our troops out and we were not going to roil the waters if that could be avoided,"" he said. Asked if he continued to believe that Americans had been left behind, Mr. Schlesinger said: ""As of now, I can come to no other conclusion.""  An Unenforceable Accord  The two former Defense Secretaries and a panel of American officials who had negotiated the 1973 peace treaty with Hanoi described an Administration desperate to extricate the United States from its first, wrenching military defeat by agreeing to a peace it would have no power to enforce.  With no leverage over Hanoi, no hope of support from Congress and no public stomach for further confrontation with the Vietnamese, President Richard M. Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, would not or could not follow through forcefully when some servicemen -- estimates vary from dozens to hundreds -- did not appear with the 591 prisoners released in the spring of 1973.  With the Watergate scandal looming larger every day, it became politically expedient to ""get Vietnam out of the way,"" as Mr. Nixon advocated in a discussion with White House advisers on March 27, 1973, according to a tape transcript circulated today by the Select Committee. Two days later, the President told a national television and radio audience that all American prisoners were on the way home.  Mr. Kissinger, who led talks with the Vietnamese and often clashed with Mr. Laird and Mr. Schlesinger, is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This is the first time that high-level Nixon Administration officials have testified before this committee.  Mr. Schlesinger, who was Secretary of Defense from July 1973 until November 1975, after serving briefly as Director of Central Intelligence, spoke of the heated emotion he encountered when he took over the Defense Department more than three months after President Nixon's television talk.  ""When I did ultimately arrive at the Pentagon, there was a still a sense of anger and frustration that so few had come home,"" said Mr. Schlesinger.  Asked about efforts by Mr. Kissinger to pursue the issue of missing Americans with Vietnamese officials in the late spring and summer of 1973, Mr. Schlesinger said that ""we didn't know what was going on behind the scenes.""  He said that other Nixon Adminisitration officials did not know that Mr. Kissinger was ""making overtures to Le Duc Tho,"" Hanoi's chief negotiator, trying unsuccessfully to get him to sign a paper on May 23 saying that no Americans were still being held.  Mr. Schlesinger said he believed that at most only one or two ""or a handful"" of Americans might have survived the last two decades in Vietnam or Laos. He said that accounts of torture and beatings brought home by prisoners led senior military officers to conclude in 1973 that the Vietnamese may have killed prisoners. Hanoi denied international relief organizations access to prisoners of war.  Several officials suggested that a substantial number of Americans downed in Laos may have met similar fates at the hands of the Pathet Lao guerrillas, a group armed but not always controlled by the Vietnamese.  Mr. Laird, who was Defense Secretary from 1969 until January of 1973, when the Paris agreement was signed, was at the center of the prisoner issue during its most critical years.  Mr. Laird told the committee that the Defense Department based its belief that unaccounted for Americans were alive in captivity at one point or another on letters received from prisoners through various channels.  ""We also had other information, which I related to you in my top secret testimony, that we were getting as far as the P.O.W.'s were concerned,"" Mr. Laird said. ""But the strongest evidence was, of course, letters.""  Laos ignored many American requests for an accounting of prisoners until the spring of 1973 when Hanoi produced a list of 10 names, one of whom turned out to be a Canadian. They were released by Hanoi under pressure from Washington.  Mr. Laird was sharply critical of the secrecy that surrounded much of the Nixon Administration's conduct of the war and peace in Vietnam. He said that the bombing of North Vietnamese sanctuaries in Cambodia should not have been done in secret. Instead, he said, it should have been discussed with Congress.  The Defense Department still lists 2,266 Americans as missing from the war. Of those, 135 are listed as ""discrepancy cases"" involving enough information to suggest that Hanoi knows what happened to the missing servicemen but has not told the United States.

"      Following are excerpts from testimony today by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger before the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, including responses to some questions posed by the committee chairman, Senator John F. Kerry:  OPENING STATEMENT  With respect to the missing: There is really, as I see it, only one difference between us. Nobody ever questioned that the accounting for the missing was unsatisfactory. We raised it at least 60 times during 1973.  The only difference is that we did not know of confirmed prisoners. And had we known it, we would have taken the most drastic steps.                                      .  .  .  Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, 23 years ago the President of the United States did me the great honor of asking me to be the principal negotiator for ending the war in Vietnam. I might add, there were not too many applicants for that position.  When the Administration in which I served entered office, it found 550,000 soldiers in Vietnam; 31,000 had already died there. We faced a ruthless enemy without any regard for human life, or elementary principles of treatment of the captured.  From the day we entered office, we had no more consistent goal than the release of the brave Americans held prisoner throughout Indochina, and a full accounting of their missing colleagues.  The negotiating record makes clear that this matter was insistently raised with the Vietnamese. Despite Hanoi's protestations, we demanded that Hanoi guarantee the release of American P.O.W.'s in Laos and Cambodia, and assist in accounting for M.I.A.'s.  There was no issue on which American officials from the President on down were more adamant . . .  After nearly four years of grueling negotiations, it was my privilege on Jan. 23, 1973, to initial the agreement to end the war that required the return of all prisoners throughout Indochina and an accounting for the missing. I am proud of what my associates and I accomplished. . . .  Here we are, 20 years later, being pilloried in leaks, without a shred of evidence, for the unforgivable libel that we knowingly abandoned the very group whose suffering was the biggest single incentive for our exertion.  The Paris accords were a major diplomatic accomplishment for America. As part of the accords, we demanded and finally received from Hanoi agreements which specifically made the withdrawal of American forces dependent on the release of our prisoners and assurances of Hanoi's assistance in the accounting for our missing.  Incentives and Penalties  Monday morning quarterbacks can argue that the Paris accords were not perfect. I agree. To me the ideal outcome would have been an American victory. But, Mr. Chairman, we had to deal with the war in the specific circumstances we faced. . . .  For example, just as I was leaving for the final negotiations in January 1973, the House and Senate Democratic caucuses each passed, by very large margins, resolutions calling for legislation to cut off all funds for the war.  I challenge those flaunting their 20-20 hindsight to say how they could have gotten better terms in that charged political atmosphere. What, precisely, would they have been willing to do to achieve what particular changes and at what cost?  Moreover, since Congress removed both incentives and penalties for Hanoi's compliance, how exactly would any achievable amendment have changed Hanoi's behavior?                                      .  .  .  I am amazed to see press stories hinting darkly about prisoners abandoned by their own Government. There has been talk of conspiracy extending through five Administrations. Leaks assert that when President Nixon announced that all prisoners were on their way home, he or his aides knew that many were left behind.  That allegation is a flat-out lie. What has happened to this country that a Congressional committee could be asked to inquire whether any American official of whatever Administration would fail to move heaven and earth to fight for the release of American P.O.W.'s and an accounting of the missing?                                      .  .  .  While I was in office, we did receive some reports alleging that live Americans were still in Indochina. I can assure you that all those reports were taken seriously. No confirmed report of living American prisoners ever crossed my desk, although I am not saying they did not exist.  At the time, returning prisoners stated that they believed that all prisoners had been released.                                      .  .  .   Favored Military Retaliation  There is, of course, the question of what more we could have done. During this period, as I have reported in detail in my memoirs, and as I explained during my deposition, I favored military retaliation against Hanoi's repeated violation. . . .  President Nixon felt that on balance it was better to have one more negotiating round.  And from the overall point of view, I had no reason to disagree with his judgment, nor do I today.  Certainly there was little support in the United States for stronger measures. Most commentators, I would say all commentators, congressional or media, opposed any effort to stand up to Hanoi, arguing that the United States had no right to retaliate at all against the North's blatant violation. . . . Nor did the Congress offer support needed to resist Hanoi's violation.  We made no secret of our outrage with Hanoi's violations. During 1973, we delivered at least 30 separate public statements or private messages to that effect. . .  Unfortunately, it was also no secret that these efforts to pin Hanoi down amounted to firing empty cannon.  In theory we had three sources of leverage available -- bombing the north, offering economic aid to Hanoi, and giving military and economic aid to Saigon to deprive Hanoi of the hope of military victory.  The Congress took all three levers away, denying us both the carrot and the stick.  When the Congress eliminated our leverage, we were trapped in the classic nightmare of every statesman. We had nothing to back up our tough words. But more tough words.  Under such conditions, we had no bargaining position left. . . . I challenge critics of the accord to say precisely how they would have achieved a better outcome under these circumstances.                                      .  .  .  So let us stop torturing ourselves. . .  The United States Government kept faith with those who served their country and suffered for it. If servicemen were kept by our enemy, there is one villain, and one villain only: the cold-hearted rulers in Hanoi.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  Q. Mr. Secretary, lightly and nicely, let me say to you, this is the longest war in American history. In 1968, President Nixon came, and that was the year I was in Vietnam fighting, came with a program for peace, supposedly. In point of fact, what you wound up with in 1973 was extraordinarily close to the program tabled in 1969.  A. Absolutely not.  Q. Very close.  A. Not even remotely.  Q. Very close. I've read it word for word.  But you suggest to me that those who oppose the war somehow took away options from you. I mean, you know, that's totally turning logic on -- I mean, the war ----  A. Mr. Chairman, it just -- what you are repeating here is the liturgy that one reads all the time that happens to be totally wrong.  I don't happen to believe that this dialogue is very helpful, because it refights the Vietnam War.  U.S. Leverage  Q. . . . You were the first person here to suggest today that somehow it is inappropriate for me to ask a question because I represented a view that denied you these things.  Now, I don't believe I denied you anything.  A. No, all I'm saying is that the people who, in good faith, were opposed to continuation of military operations, cannot now say -- I do not in the slightest question your good faith -- cannot now say you didn't get what you only could have gotten by continuing military operations. That is all.                                      .  .  .  Q. The question is whether we got the full accounting and if we didn't, why. The question is did we move heaven and earth, as you said we would. Were we brutal in our response, as you told the families we would be?  The answer is no.  Now, I've suggested that perhaps the reason is not that you were perfidious but that the Presidency crumbled, that there was not a capacity. If you think it's otherwise, I'd love to know.  'You Go Picking'  A. Yes, I think it's otherwise, Mr. Chairman. First of all, Mr. Chairman, it is no great achievement. If you go picking through bureaucratic documents and use one sentence to prove what the motive was, nobody can believe --  Q. Sir, this is not a bureaucratic document. This is an American serviceman who was held as a prisoner in Vietnam.  LOAD-DATE: September 23, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Text                      ",September 22 1992 ,11
"      Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said today that top officials of the Nixon Administration did not knowingly leave American prisoners of war behind in Vietnam and Laos when United States troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1973.  On the second day of a new round of Senate committee hearings, Mr. Kissinger rejected suggestions that the Nixon Administration, falling deeper under the shadow of Watergate, had made a political decision to turn its back on the unfinished business of Vietnam.  ""Let's stop torturing ourselves,"" Mr. Kissinger said. ""The United States kept faith with those who served their country. If servicemen were kept by our enemies, there is one villain and one villain only: the cold-hearted rulers in Hanoi."" [Excerpts, page A8.]  Issue Never Put to Rest  The day was marked by bitter exchanges with Senators whom he cast as representatives of the anti-war lobby that hobbled the Nixon Administration's ability to retaliate for North Vietnamese violations of the January 1973 accord. Mr. Kissinger, who was the chief American negotiator with the Communist North Vietnamese, said he could not rule out that Americans had been ""kept behind"" by Communists in Indochina, particularly by the Pathet Lao movement in Laos.  The issue of Americans believed to have been captured by Communist forces in either Vietnam or Laos and not returned or otherwise accounted for after the signing of the 1973 accord has never been put to rest. There have been unsubstantiated assertions for years about sightings of Americans in Laos or Vietnam.  The Senate committee headed by Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachussets, has produced hundreds of documents on the subject. On Monday, Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger, both of whom served as Secretary of Defense at different times in 1973, told Mr. Kerry's special committee that they believed even in 1973 that some prisoners may not have been returned and were probably alive for a time. That led Mr. Kissinger today to say that if they believed that they never told him.  Mr. Kissinger expressed particular frustration with Mr. Schlesinger, someone with whom he was often at odds. Mr. Schlesinger, who also served as Director of Central Intelligence, said on Monday that there was a ""high probability"" that Laos kept some prisoners and a ""medium probability"" that Vietnam did.  He challenged Mr. Schlesinger to find ""one memorandum, one phone conversation, one meeting or one anything in which he expressed at the time the views he expressed now.""  Mr. Kissinger said that as national security adviser to President Nixon and chief negotiator with the North Vietnamese, he had pressed Hanoi for months after the signing of the 1973 accord for better accounting of men who were inexplicably missing or thought to be in captivity who had not come home, and were not on a list of dead provided by Hanoi.  ""I never said they're all dead,"" he told the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, about the unaccounted for Americans. He said that on Feb. 11, 1973, he first presented Hanoi with discrepancies arising from the lists it had provided of the prisoners.  Mr. Kissinger served as Secretary of State from 1973 to 1977 and as national security adviser from 1969 to 1975. Of Mr. Laird, who accused Mr. Kissinger of allowing the Vietnamese to put off an exchange of prisoner lists until the signing of the 1973 accord -- therefore making it likely that it would be too late to deal with serious discrepancies -- Mr. Kissinger said today, ""I didn't quite follow what Secretary Laird was saying, but that's nothing new to me.""  Also on Monday, Winston Lord, one of Mr. Kissinger's top aides during the peace talks, told the committee that President .Nixon had been forced to make an ""agonizing"" choice in the spring of 1973 about whether to reopen hostilities with Vietnam over the issue of unaccounted Americans.  Mr. Kissinger said today that Mr. Lord may have been referring to a period in late March 1973 when the national security adviser and other officials were suggesting that Washington threaten Vietnam with a resumption of military force if it failed to live up to the peace agreement. Mr. Nixon decided that would be unwise, because 160 prisoners were still to be returned by Hanoi, an exchange that was completed on March 28.  Addressing Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kissinger said that ""with respect to the missing, there is really, as I see it, only one difference between us.""  ""Nobody ever questioned that the accounting for the missing was unsatisfactory,"" Mr. Kissinger said. ""We raised it at least 60 times during 1973. The only difference is that we did not know of confirmed prisoners, and had we known it, we would have taken the most drastic steps.""  This afternoon, Mr. Kissinger said that the White House did not make itself responsible for keeping detailed lists of prisoners before the signing of the peace accord, and would not have known independently if men were missing from Hanoi's lists. It was not until the weeks after the signing of the treaty that he began to be aware of Defense Department concerns about specific Americans who were inexplicably not among the returning prisoners.  In hindsight, Mr. Kissinger said, he thought that the possibility that prisoners were left behind was ""low"" for Vietnam, but ""somewhat higher"" in Laos."" He also said that 10 foreigners -- 9 Americans and a Canadian -- purportedly freed by the Pathet Lao through Hanoi along with Vietnamese-held prisoners had never really been in Laotian custody, since Vietnamese troops were numerous in Laos.  ""It is possible we never got a Pathet Lao prisoner,"" he said. ""The Pathet Lao may have done what the Khmer Rouge did: kill every prisoner.""  Estimates of Americans who may have been prisoners in Laos range from 40 to several hundred. The United States had no agreement with Laos, with which it was not technically at war, although American bombers regularly raked the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which ran through the poor Southeast Asian country. A ""secret war"" was also fought on the ground by American-trained Laotian tribal people.  After the end of French colonial rule in 1954, Laos had a series of unstable coalition governments until 1975, when the Pathet Lao, believed to be a ruthless movement doing Hanoi's bidding, gradually seized power in the wake of the collapse of Saigon to Hanoi's troops and the fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge, who had also been backed originally by the North Vietnamese.  When the United States withdrew from Vietnam in 1973, the Nixon Administration expected Hanoi to take responsibility for prisoners in Laos and Cambodia.  Today, Mr. Kissinger tried to lay the blame for missing Americans squarely on the Vietnamese.  ""From the day we entered office, we had no more consistent goal than the release of the brave Americans held prisoner throughout Indochina, and a full accounting of their missing colleagues,"" he said.  He said that he and his colleagues were being ""pilloried in leaks, without a shred of evidence, for the unforgivable libel that we knowingly abandoned the very group whose suffering was the biggest single incentive for our exertion.""  He said such suggestions were ""a flat-out lie.""  ""What has happened to this country that a Congressional committee could be asked to inquire whether any American official of whatever administration would fail to move heaven and earth to fight for the release of American P.O.W.'s and an accounting of the missing,"" he said.  In often heated and emotional exchanges, Mr. Kissinger tangled several times with Senator Kerry. Mr. Kerry, a decorated Navy officer who fought in Vietnam in the 1960's but turned against the war after his return, was accused by Mr. Kissinger of being part of the problem in 1973.  After Mr. Kerry spoke of two specific cases of servicemen known to be alive in the late 1960's who did not return, along with other evidence collected by the committee over nearly a year and excerpts from Mr. Kissinger's memoirs that seemed to undercut some of his assertions, the former national security adviser shot back, ""First of all, Mr. Chairman, it is no great achievement to go picking through bureaucratic documents and use one sentence to prove what the motive was.""  Mr. Kerry replied: ""Sir, this is not a bureaucratic document. This is an American serviceman who was held as a prisoner in Vietnam.""  At another point, Mr. Kissinger accused Mr. Kerry, whose committee has succeeded in having thousands of secret papers declassified, of ""just playing with documents.""  ""Sir, I'm playing with facts,"" Mr. Kerry said.   LOAD-DATE: September 23, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photos: Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger at hearing yesterday. (pg.

"      On May 18, 1965, when the American war in Indochina was still in its early stages, Capt. David L. Hrdlicka, an Air Force pilot, was shot down in an F-105D over Laos. He walked away from the crash, and into oblivion.  There is evidence he survived: The Communist Pathet Lao who apparently captured him took pictures. One of them appeared in the Soviet newspaper Pravda in Moscow and a Vietnamese daily in Hanoi; another was later displayed in a Lao museum. His arrest was announced on the radio. The Pathet Lao also broadcast a tape recording purportedly of the American pilot asking for pardon and release.  List Presented to Hanoi   In Washington, Captain Hrdlicka was registered as a prisoner of war, an early entry on a list that would contain hundreds by January 1973, when Hanoi and the Nixon Administration signed a peace agreement. American forces began to withdraw from Vietnam, and prisoners began returning home.  Captain Hrdlicka was not among the 591 United States servicemen returned by Hanoi in Operation Homecoming. Like Pfc. Jon Sparks, ambushed in central Vietnam; Lieut. Ronald W. Dodge, who ejected from an aircraft over North Vietnam, and dozens of other servicemen and a few civilians in official custody, Captain Hrdlicka became a ""discrepancy case.""  His name was placed on a selected but by no means comprehensive list of 82 servicemen who inexplicably did not return, to be presented to Hanoi a few months after the Paris peace treaty by Henry A. Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon's national security adviser and later Secretary of State. The Vietnamese never responded to requests for information.  Now, in the blizzard of documents circulating here as the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs tries to narrow and identify the number of Americans who may have been left behind in Indochina when American forces were withdrawn, that 1973 list, declassified for the first time this week, has become one more piece in a still unfinished puzzle.  In hearings this week, top officials of the Nixon Administration have sparred over what was known in 1973 about the missing, reflecting confusion and controversy. None of the officials, including Mr. Kissinger, the chief negotiator with the Vietnamese, and two former Secretaries of Defense, Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger, were able to say categorically that no Americans had been left behind -- or ""kept"" behind by Communist governments, in Mr. Kissinger's preferred terminology.  What was in dispute is whether anyone could confirm that American prisoners were alive in captivity when United States withdrew. Hanoi had denied access to its prisons to the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Separate investigations conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Senate Select Committee indicate that there are still between 100 and 200 discrepancy cases awaiting attention by Hanoi or the Laotian Government, nearly 20 years after the Paris peace accord. But the two lists while similar in length -- 133 for the Select Committee, 135 for the Pentagon -- are not the same; only about 40 names appear on both.  When Operation Homecoming began in early 1973, the United States listed 1,929 servicemen as P.O.W.-M.I.A. Some 1,100 more were classified as K.I.A.-B.N.R. -- killed in action, body not recovered. All people lost in covert operations were apparently on those lists, including 150-200 whose places of death were falsified to hide their presence in Cambodia or Laos, where Americans were not supposed to be.  Officials of the Nixon Administration have said again and again this week that these figures do not mean there were large numbers -- if any -- of live prisoners identifiable absolutely by name and location when American forces were withdrawn, only that there were a significant number known to have survived a crash or capture. Hanoi has consistently maintained it held no American prisoners after 1973.  Nearly all officials involved with the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue are certain that no Americans have survived. Many family members believe otherwise.  Officially, the United States still lists 2,266 Americans as unaccounted for in Indochina, more than half cases of unrecovered bodies. Of the remainder, the Defense Department says Hanoi could help explain at least 80-100 of its 135 extant discrepancy cases.  What officials are looking for in these cases is not living Americans but explanations of what happened to the people who did not come home.  Some cases have been closed by Hanoi. The remains of Lieutenant Dodge, whom Vietnamese officials denied knowledge of in 1973, were later returned without explanation. His story has become a symbol of the mysterious behavior of Vietnam on this issue, an attitude that has helped immeasurably to foster beliefs that Americans were killed in contravention of international conventions, consigned to secret prisons or sent to Moscow or Beijing.  Leo Hrdlicka said in an interview today that he has been given information by former intelligence officials that has led him to believe that his brother David was sent to the Soviet Union, although both Moscow and Hanoi deny this.  The case of Private Sparks, ambushed with his platoon on June 17, 1969, in what was still South Vietnam, remains under active investigation by the Pentagon. Private Sparks was reported captured; a 1970 letter confirmed this, officials say. The soldier was nevertheless declared dead in 1979 because there had been no new information. It was unexpectedly reopened in 1989 after reports of sightings of an American who fit his profile.  LOAD-DATE: September 24, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 23 1992 ,11
"      Elliot L. Richardson, Secretary of Defense when American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1973, said today that the Pentagon believed that some prisoners of war might have remained in neighboring Laos, contrary to a statement by President Nixon that all the prisoners were on their way home.  Mr. Richardson, who was Defense Secretary for four months between the signing of the Paris peace agreement on Jan. 27, 1973, and his appointment as Attorney General in May, told the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs that he could only speculate why Mr. Nixon told Americans on March 29, 1973, that ""all our American P.O.W.'s are on their way home.""  Mr. Richardson conjectured that politics may have been a consideration in the President's decision to say all the prisoners were returning when the Pentagon was producing tallies of possible prisoners. Or the White House may have tried to avoid raising false hopes among relatives.  ""Whatever made the considerations, somebody could rationalize the distinction between the basis of this number and the basis for his statement,"" Mr. Richardson said when shown the Pentagon tallies. ""But how it actually came about, for all I know he deliberately chose to lie. But I try to give him the benefit of the doubt.""  Earlier in the week, two other former Defense Secretaries, Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger, both indicated that they believed there was a possibility that some Americans were left behind. But former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said that while it was possible that some of those unaccounted for at the end of the war might have been prisoners, there was no hard evidence to support that, and that if any officials believed there were prisoners, they never said that to him.  Memo Called for Diplomacy  Mr. Richardson said today, ""The Defense Department was doing everything, in effect, that was in our power to track down additional P.O.W.'s."" A Pentagon memorandum to the White House recommending a diplomatic offensive on the issue was apparently ignored, several officials said today.  Mr. Richardson was dismissed as Attorney General by Mr. Nixon in the ""Saturday night massacre"" of October 1973, after refusing to dismiss the Watergate prosecutor, Archibald Cox.  As classified documents from the White House, Pentagon and State Department have been released over the last few months at the request of the committee, attention has gradually centered on Laos, a poor nation dominated by Vietnam since the end of French rule in Indochina in 1954. For more than a decade, the Central Intelligence Agency ran a ""secret war"" in Laos, arming anti-Communist tribal people and Thai irregulars.  In 1973, the Defense Intelligence Agency listed more than 350 Americans as missing or prisoners of war in Laos. By the end of March, 591 prisoners had been returned by Hanoi. Only nine of them were captured in Laos.  On the day before President Nixon told a national television audience that all the prisoners were coming home from Indochina, Mr. Richardson had sent a memorandum to Mr. Kissinger, then national security adviser, saying he was ""concerned over the situation in Laos regarding our men who are still being held prisoner or missing.""  Military Threat Urged  In the memo, Mr. Richardson recommended that Hanoi and the Laotians be threatened with renewed military action to demonstrate that ""the U.S. will no longer play games with the P.O.W. issue in Laos.""  Testifying today with Mr. Richardson was Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, who helped write a position paper on the Laos prisoner issue addressed to the Defense Secretary as well as the memo to Mr. Kissinger.  Mr. Secord said that based on the number of American planes shot down over Laos and the number of crewmen known to have survived crashes, it would have been ""absurd"" not to expect 20 to 40 more Americans to have come home from Laos.  He said there was enough evidence, including photographs of prisoners, to know with ""a high degree of certitude"" that Americans were in captivity.  The United States, which did not have a separate peace treaty with Laos, held Hanoi responsible for the return of prisoners captured by the Communist Pathet Lao.  'Not Absolutely Certain'  When Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the committee, asked Mr. Richardson whether he would concur that a statement saying all prisoners were coming home was incorrect, the former Attorney General replied, ""Yes.""  ""We had reason to believe there were additional prisoners of war in the hands of the Laotians,"" Mr. Richardson said. Then, echoing the earlier testimony of Mr. Laird and Mr. Schlesinger, he added: ""We were not absolutely certain. We did not have definitive information as to the numbers.""  Several panels of witnesses from the Nixon Administration told the Senate committtee that the antiwar mood of the United States made any military action unlikely, however.

"    America's Vietnam agony ended a generation ago but one issue won't go away -- the fate of several hundred servicemen who disappeared after being captured in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Few are likely to be alive. But their families are entitled to know anything the U.S. Government has learned about them, and anything it can still find out.  For the past year, the Senate P.O.W.-M.I.A. Committee has worked diligently to provide such an accounting. But this week President Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, took the stand and the hearings quickly degenerated into refighting old policy battles.  The families so long deceived deserve better from their country than again to be left to watch as self-justifying politicians and strategists plunge back into the quagmire.  The Paris peace accords of January 1973 obligated North Vietnam to return all American prisoners of war. When Hanoi handed back 591 prisoners,the Nixon Administration proclaimed success. But Washington's own secret figures showed that hundreds more had fallen into enemy hands alive and remained unaccounted for.  It now turns out that the Administration based its claim of success on semantic distinctions. Since Washington had no proof that the others remained alive in 1973, it listed them not as P.O.W.'s but as M.I.A.'s, missing in action. That shamefully misled the families and forfeited a chance to press Hanoi for the prisoners' return.  For the next two decades, successive Administrations discounted or even ridiculed reports of surviving prisoners. Belatedly, the present Senate committee's bipartisan effort is rectifying a painful wrong.  To its credit, the Bush Administration has turned over masses of once-classified material. Three Nixon-era Defense Secretaries, Melvin Laird, James Schlesinger and Elliot Richardson, have acknowledged that the Pentagon could have been more candid.  But Mr. Kissinger offered only sophistry, self-justification and counterattacks. Classifying those reported captured as missing rather than as prisoners, he contended, helped spare the families suffering. He bridled at the very idea of questions from the committee co-chairman John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran turned war critic. He blamed anti-war senators of the 70's for undercutting his bargaining hand with Hanoi, and thus for any prisoners left behind.  The families of those still unaccounted for have already lost far too much time to these obsolete arguments between hawks and doves. Their needs, not political reputations, ought to be the primary concern. Senator Kerry's responsibility is to help them gain the fullest possible understanding of the fate of their loved ones.

"    IN three days of Senate committee hearings last week on American servicemen who failed to return from the war in Indochina, an array of Nixon Administration officials all acknowledged that there was a good chance some men had been left behind when Hanoi returned 591 prisoners of war in early 1973.  Henry A. Kissinger, National Security Adviser and chief negotiator with the Vietnamese at the time, angrily denied that the Administration had knowingly abandoned anyone, but he admitted that the issue was of major concern to him by early February 1973, two weeks after the signing of the Paris peace agreement. Mr. Kissinger presented Hanoi with a ""discrepancy list"" on Feb. 11; others followed in the succeeding months.  The Senate Select Committee on P. O. W. -M. I. A. Affairs, which has successfully declassified thousands of secret documents, has largely put to rest old theories about the Government covering up the existence of hundreds of prisoners. But more questions are being asked about what happened to those prisoners -- perhaps 40 to 80 cases -- who might have survived the war, only to disappear later, especially in Laos.  Pressed for explanations for apparent American inaction, Mr. Kissinger blamed Congress, the anti-war movement and the press for tying the Administration's hands in talks with the North Vietnamese.  ""In response to my presentations, Le Duc Tho disdainfully read me editorials from the American press and speeches from the Congressional Record,"" Mr. Kissinger said. ""His message was clear: I understand what you are saying, but I also know that you have no way to back up your threats.""

"      Congress and the Nixon Administration, bitter adversaries in 1973 when American troops withdrew from Vietnam, confronted each other again this week in Senate hearings that went to the heart of almost every contentious aspect of the issue of missing American servicemen. The hearings may have changed the substance of the emotional debate over the boys who didn't come home.  ""We're not here to refight the Vietnam War,"" Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs told Henry A. Kissinger, President Nixon's national security adviser and later Secretary of State. But exchanges were sharp, especially on questions of how hard Mr. Kissinger had pushed Hanoi to account for missing Americans.  ""There is nothing in the record that suggests you asked the Congress of the United States for the right to bomb because they were holding prisoners that they wouldn't give back,"" said Senator Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who joined the antiwar movement in the early 1970's. ""Nothing.""  ""Mr. Chairman,"" replied Mr. Kissinger, ""for somebody who opposed any military operations, who was accusing the Government of deliberately prolonging the war, it does not come as good grace to make this accusation.""  Old Myths Put to Rest  When three days of testimony from an array of high-level witnesses before the select committee were over, 20 years of pent-up hostilities had been aired and new facts had been revealed about various lists of men the Pentagon or other agencies of government strongly suspected were in captivity when President Nixon was declaring all prisoners returned.  After months of testimony and the declassification of previously secret documents, the committee has largely put to rest old myths about government conspiracies to cover up the existence of hundreds of Americans still struggling to escape captivity.  Fewer stories are now told about American prisoners still alive in Indochina. But more questions are being asked about what happened to those who might have survived the war, only to disappear later, especially in Laos. The numbers are not large, perhaps 40 to 80 especially compelling cases. But officials no longer deny that there were men left behind, only that they were never knowingly abandoned.  Pressed for explanations for seeming American inaction in forcing a better accounting of prisoners from Hanoi, Mr. Kissinger angrily turned the tables on his questioners, charging Congress, the antiwar movement and the press with hobbling the Administration in talks with the North Vietnamese.  ""In response to my presentations, Le Duc Tho disdainfully read me editorials from the American press and speeches from the Congressional Record,"" Mr. Kissinger told the committee. ""His message was clear: I understand what you are saying but I also know that you have no way to back up your threats.""  'Bad and Cynical History'  To take away the power to deal with Hanoi, and then blame the Nixon Administration for not getting a full accounting of prisoners, was ""straight from Kafka,"" Mr. Kissinger said.  ""While it may make good theater, it is bad and cynical history.""  But some of Mr. Kissinger's contemporaries, including two former Defense Secretaries, Melvin R. Laird and James R. Schlesinger, remembered how the secrecy that surrounded the Nixon-Kissinger team helped poison the atmosphere of government and the Administration's credibility in the country.  There were secret peace talks behind the facade of open negotiations with Hanoi, and meetings with Vietnamese leaders that Nixon Cabinet members did not know about. There was the secret bombing of Cambodia, which outraged Congress unnecessarily, Mr. Laird said.  The mood of one tortured year, 1973, has been recalled repeatedly in hearings to illuminate the confusions and passions that surrounded the collapse of the American war in Indochina.  In early 1973, Mr. Schlesinger, then Director of Central Intelligence before becoming Secretary of Defense, was spending 70 to 80 percent of his time in Congress dealing with allegations of C.I.A. involvement in the Watergate scandal, he told the committee. Another former Defense Secretary, Elliot Richardson, recalled being preoccupied with NATO and a review of American strategy in the wake of the Vietnam defeat while trying to pass along to the President the Pentagon's concern about possible remaining prisoners.  Hanoi's Violations Recalled  In general, Americans were grappling with an unusual national defeat, and the realization that when a country loses a conflict, it has little power to dictate the peace.  Hanoi came into focus again this week also, but in a harsh light, as Senators heard one official after another describe its violations of the Paris peace agreement and subsequent disregard of American requests for information on possible prisoners.  Hanoi, moving along the State Department's ""road map"" to diplomatic recognition by the United States and the lifting of an American trade embargo, had passed all the necessary milestones except for one: to demonstrate significant progress on resolving more of the cases of the missing where evidence points to Vietnamese knowledge of a serviceman's fate.

"    Vietnam hawks and doves found a new battleground last week -- Senate hearings on prisoners of war and missing in action. Once again, they left each other and their country bloodied. One more time, they blinded the nation to fundamental truths about its long nightmare.  Hawks like Henry Kissinger kept pushing the deception that South Vietnam alone could have held off the Communists at war's end had not doves denied U.S. military help. The Kissingers continued to run from the central truth that can still liberate them and the nation from Vietnam's shadow: South Vietnam lost the war, not America and not American doves. It was always Saigon's war to win or lose, though the U.S. lost its wealth, its soul and hundreds of thousands killed and wounded in giving Saigon a chance.  Doves like Senator John Kerry again ignored the chance to bring home this truth. Their interest seemed limited to finding a new weapon against hawks, who they believe dragged the U.S. into the war and then unpardonably prolonged it. Thus the Kerrys, too, fled from a liberating truth: Liberals and conservatives alike promoted and supported the U.S. commitment to ""save Vietnam from Communism"" until the late 60's. Whoever lied about whatever, that collective responsibility remains.  All such thoughts were far from everyone's mind when Senator Kerry, a war hero, decided to look at the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue. His initial idea was to put that wrenching matter behind the nation and get on with the long process of normalizing relations with Vietnam.  Somewhere along the way, he found strong suggestions that Hanoi did indeed hold back servicemen, and that Richard Nixon knew this in 1973 and did nothing to free them -- supposedly to rush through the politically popular withdrawal of all U.S. forces in a vain effort to salvage his Presidency from the Watergate scandal.  Last week's evidence and testimony were often imprecise. News stories compounded the confusion.  These seem to be the facts: Hanoi did return all confirmed P.O.W.'s in 1973. But there was evidence then that a number of servicemen listed as M.I.A.'s might have been alive, mainly in Laos. President Nixon knew this and told Americans about it in March 1973. But neither he nor Mr. Kissinger pressed the issue further with the public, despite promptings by some aides.  When Senator Kerry hit Mr. Kissinger with the charge that he had not done all he could to free servicemen knowingly left behind by the U.S., the former Secretary of State struck back. People who opposed further U.S. military action at the time, he said, ""cannot now say you didn't get what you only could have gotten by continuing military operations.""  The nerve touched, out came the venom from Mr. Kissinger, Gen. Alexander Haig and others: The U.S. could have threatened Hanoi over the M.I.A.'s save for the doves' opposition. Moreover, they argued, South Vietnam could have been saved if doves had not cut off military action and aid, thus stabbing the Vietnamization policy in the back.  This was the 1969 policy of withdrawing U.S. forces and turning the war over to the South Vietnamese. But Vietnamization never could have worked, as David Halberstam and Stanley Karnow, the great historians of the war, never tire of explaining.  How could Saigon, corrupt and lacking the mantle of nationalism, stand up to Hanoi, which, rightly or wrongly, held that mantle? How could South Vietnamese forces defeat Hanoi when 550,000 U.S. fighters backed by the heaviest bombing in history could not?  Vietnamization was a fraud. Many hawks sold it simply to create ""a decent interval"" or ""a fig leaf"" between U.S. withdrawal and Saigon's defeat. Many doves went along with it simply as the most opportune way out.  By 1973, the Nixons and Kissingers wanted out as badly as the Kerrys. And Hanoi knew it. The U.S. thus had no leverage over Hanoi to free captive servicemen, if there were any, let alone to go on postponing Saigon's inevitable fate.  Americans had freely chosen to do all they reasonably could -- and so much more -- to prevent or delay that day. By 1973, with costs still mounting and no end in sight, they had had enough. These truths are plain. Yet hawks and doves are not willing to settle for them, not now, perhaps never.

"    In the winter of 1973, the Nixon-Kissinger team and its most passionate American enemies were in agreement on one overriding judgment: The war in Vietnam was lost and had to be ended.  About 17 years earlier, President Eisenhower had begun sending military advisers and intelligence operators into Vietnam -- the first American involvement. Then Presidents Kennedy and Johnson each chose to deepen a war that tore apart American society long before it was over.  Richard Nixon became the only President to try, almost desperately, to end the war through negotiation. Without Henry Kissinger those negotiations would not have started, or ended in a peace agreement.  Two decades later Americans still want and deserve a full accounting of any U.S. prisoners of war not freed, and what was done about them, or left undone.  But the value of the Senate hearings on P.O.W.'s will be ruined if they become just one more arena for politicians, academics and journalists who cherish their vendetta against Mr. Kissinger, one more chance to treat a man without whom the peace agreement would have been impossible as some unindicted conspirator.  The very fact that he dares defend himself -- with a kind of professional, respectful contempt -- enrages them even more.  To select Mr. Kissinger as the target is unfair historically. And it lessens the chances of two central realities being made clear. One is that the villain was Hanoi, now cuddly Hanoi. Only the Communists could have kept any Americans hostage.  The other is that through callousness or sloth, every Administration during and since the war failed to clarify the P.O.W. story -- else we would not still be asking questions.  As a condition of peace, Mr. Kissinger insisted on a Communist commitment to release all prisoners. Maybe tougher safeguards could have been written into the agreement. Would Congress and the peace activists have accepted the continuation of the war that might have meant?  Hardly likely. In 1971, two years before any peace agreement, John Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who became a peace activist, said that ""points"" presented by Hanoi-Vietcong delegations in Paris, and their conversations with him and other Americans, showed prisoners would be returned. So, he said, the U.S. should not ""stall"" any longer.  Mr. Kerry is now a talented Senator from Massachusetts. And now he is conducting a P.O.W. inquiry because so many Americans believe exactly what he thought could not happen -- that the Communists kept some prisoners.  Not long after the peace agreement was signed, Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Nixon warned that some prisoners might still be held. Did the peace movement or Congress demand reprisal pressures against Hanoi?  Mr. Kissinger's essential role in ending the war does not wipe out the Senate's duty to investigate the fate of all P.O.W.'s, but it distorts reality to forget what happened in 1973.  Walter Isaacson, in his much-discussed biography ""Kissinger,"" is often sharply critical of his subject. But he puts criticism of the peace negotiations in this perspective:  ""By the beginning of 1973, Kissinger and Nixon had brought the nation's military misadventure in Vietnam to an end. Instead of slinking away as the Vietnamese factions continued the war, Kissinger had secured a cease-fire that, at least for the moment, curtailed the killing. In addition, America's ally had been given a decent chance to survive.  ""Officials in the previous two Administrations, many of whom became preening doves as soon as their responsibility ended, had overseen a foolish deployment of close to 550,000 American troops over eight years. The Nixon Administration immediately reversed the process and began withdrawing. . . .  ""The Paris agreement was the final element of a reshaped American foreign policy that -- rather amazingly -- provided the nation with the chance to play as influential a role in the world as it had before the paralyzing despair of its Vietnam involvement.""  Senator Kerry can serve America by a full and fair inquiry. That opportunity will be lost if the investigation is influenced by any vendetta against Mr. Kissinger. The country deserves better. So does Henry Kissinger.  LOAD-DATE: September 29, 1992  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Op-Ed                      ",September 29 1992 ,11
"    To the Editor:  Once again the Vietnam War has spilled into our newspapers and into our consciousness. We are again debating whether Americans missing in action might have been left behind in Vietnam.  As someone who spent five years in humanitarian service in Vietnam during the war and who has visited that country several times in recent years, I also search for truths to guide us through this anguished history.  I visited Vietnam in 1985 and again in 1989 in connection with the Mennonite Central Committee's agricultural and medical assistance programs there. I have had opportunity to confer with Vietnamese Government officials and, more important, to visit privately with many Vietnamese who were intimate friends before the fall of Saigon in 1975.  American friends have often asked me whether I believe American M.I.A.'s still remain in Vietnam. My response: We cannot know for certain, but I doubt it. Why do I feel that way?  Of the handful of Americans who, like me, chose to stay or failed to get out of South Vietnam at the time of the Communist takeover in 1975, I know of no attempt by the revolutionary Government to keep Americans in Vietnam. Rather, the policy I encountered consistently from the low-level fighters to the highest revolutionary officials was to register those remaining Americans and deport them within months of the takeover.  During my more recent visits, close Vietnamese friends have sometimes been extremely critical of the Communist Government in private. I have had people tell me they knew of places where Americans, killed during the war, were buried. Never, however, did any of them even suggest that they believed live Americans were being held today in Vietnam.  That, of course, proves nothing. But given the well-established grapevine and rumor-mill communication in the country, the lack of such reports among the Vietnamese public makes me doubt that Americans remain against their will.

"      In a report that will help fuel the continuing argument over the handling of servicemen missing in the Indochina war, the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs has concluded that the possibility remains that some prisoners of war were left behind when American forces withdrew from South Vietnam in 1973.  After more than a year of hearings, investigations of Government documents and trips to Southeast Asia, the committee could not come to a conclusive finding on whether Americans were left prisoner in Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos.  Committee members were split in the final drafting of the report, with two Republican Senators, Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, pressing the panel to criticize the Defense Department and other agencies more strongly for abandoning servicemen, or at least not adequately accounting for them.  ""We acknowledge that there is no proof that U.S. P.O.W.'s survived, but neither is there proof that one or more did not,"" said a Jan. 5 draft of the report, which Congressional aides say is almost identical to the final draft to be released on Wednesday. ""There is evidence, moreover, that indicates the possibility of survival, at least for a small number"" after the release of American prisoners following the withdrawal settlement, the report said.  Prisoners Left After Pullout  The report's findings, at least in part, contradict a 1976 House committee report, as well as numerous assertions by officials in the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations that dismissed the possibility that American prisoners had survived since the early 1970's.  ""This committee has uncovered evidence that precludes it from taking the same view,"" the draft stated.  The report said there were American soldiers ""known or thought possibly to have been alive in captivity who did not come back"" in the 1973 prisoner release. It also said that United States defense and intelligence officials hoped about 40 prisoners captured in Laos would be released that year, instead of the 12 returned.  ""These reports were taken seriously enough at the time to prompt recommendations for military action aimed at gaining the release of the additional prisoners thought to be held,"" the draft said.  And in a finding that could be a source of encouragement to relatives to press efforts to find missing servicemen, the report said information gathered by intelligence agencies over the last 19 years ""raises questions about the possibility that a small number"" of Americans ""may have survived in captivity.""  Criticism of Efforts  The committee concluded that Washington did not knowingly abandon the missing servicemen. ""American officials,"" it said, "" did not have certain knowledge that any specific prisoner or prisoners were being left behind."" But it asserted that missing Americans as a group were ""shunted aside and discounted by Government and population alike.""  It also noted that past Administrations made attempts to account for the missing, but it characterized these efforts as ""impersonal, relatively low-level and non-specific.""  The committee reserved special criticism for the Defense Intelligence Agency's P.O.W.-M.I.A. office, which it said was overly sensitive to criticism and slow in responding to reports on surviving servicemen.  But it said the greatest difficulty over the years in accounting for the servicemen was the lack of cooperation from governments in Southeast Asia. Vietnamese cooperation has improved in the last few years, the report said. It charged that Laos was lagging, although there are signs of improvement.  While expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia, the report said his Phnom Penh Government could not cooperate fully in areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge.

"      No issue has been more enduring or painful over the last three decades than the fate of thousands of United States servicemen taken prisoner or missing during the Vietnam War and still unaccounted for.  But after 17 months of hearings, the largest declassification of Government documents in history and search missions throughout Asia, today a special Senate panel issued a report that may succeed only in fanning the embers.  The Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs was organized to put the issue to rest. The panel offered comfort and information to scores of families about their loved ones. It succeeded in pushing Vietnam to cooperate in accounting for the missing. And it helped expose the operations of people faking evidence to capitalize on the hopes of relatives of the more than 2,000 Americans whose fates have not been conclusively determined.  But the report's basic conclusion differs little from what the official Government position has been for years. ""We acknowledge that there is no proof that United States P.O.W.'s survived, but neither is there proof that all of those who did not return had died,"" the report said.  While it found ""no compelling evidence"" that missing servicemen were still alive in Indochina, it reported evidence ""that indicates the possibility of survival, at least for a small number"" of them after the 1973 prisoner release following the Paris peace talks.  ""This report does not close the issue,"" Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the committee, acknowledged today. ""There is evidence, tantalizing evidence, that raises questions. But questions are not facts and are not proof.""  Perhaps the report's most provocative finding is that American officials had hoped that about 40 prisoners would be released by Laos in 1973; instead only 12 were returned.  ""These reports were taken seriously enough at the time to prompt recommendations by some officials for military action aimed at gaining the release of the additional prisoners thought to be held,"" the report said.  The committee criticized Washington's handling of intelligence information and said disclosure of information to family members had been inadequate. But it strenuously denied that any deliberate cover-up took place.  It also disclosed that the Reagan Administration had secretly funneled donations from P.O.W.-M.I.A. groups to supply and arm anti-Communist Laotian rebels, an operation that was not authorized by Congress and that Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said he would refer to the Justice Department for investigation.  Only moments after the report was released, several friends and families of the missing attacked its conclusion that there was no compelling evidence that the servicemen were still alive. They said that was a wrong interpretation of the evidence or another instance of a wide conspiracy that goes back to the Nixon Administration.  Six relatives of missing Americans put out a statement criticizing the report, saying the panel failed to obtain essential documents and testimony.  Ted Guy, a retired Air Force colonel active in the National Alliance of Families for the Return of Americas Missing Servicemen, said, ""The coverup and mindset to debunk continues."" Mr. Guy, who was shot down and held in Laos from 1968 to 1973, said nearly 600 Americans captured in Laos were never recovered. He said Laotians could still be holding Americans for ransom, which the report says defies logic since no ransom demand has been made.  The charges of cover-up were also fueled by dissent in the committee.  For instance, Mr. Grassley and Senator Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire, the deputy chairman of the panel, urged the inclusion of a section on satellite imagery of what the two Republicans said was credible evidence of prisoners' sending distress signals.  Senator John McCain, a Republican panel member from Arizona, said he hoped that the report would show that ""there is no proof that Americans are alive there."" But he added that some families of the missing ""have accused me of being everything from a traitor to the Manchurian candidate, and that isn't likely to change.""

"    The thorough Senate committee report released yesterday on the fate of Americans missing since the Vietnam War should dispel suspicions of a U.S. Government conspiracy or cover-up.  Should, but probably won't. Word that Henry Kissinger's lawyer was given a last-minute opportunity to propose cosmetic changes in language criticizing the former Secretary of State will damage the report's credibility, even though telling substantive criticisms of Nixon-era officials seem to have survived largely intact.  Mr. Kissinger's intrusive intervention is regrettable. More important public issues than his personal reputation are at stake.  The main reason this committee was established, almost 20 years after America's withdrawal from Vietnam, was that many Americans no longer trusted the executive branch's efforts and assurances on the issue of P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s.  To its credit, the Bush Administration granted the committee unprecedented access to official records. So did the Vietnamese Government. And sworn public testimony was taken from a procession of former high American officials.  The public expected authoritative, if not definitive, conclusions. To a large extent, that's what it got, despite tensions between some Republicans who believe captive Americans may still be alive and other committee members who believe that the passage of many years effectively rules out that possibility. The committee majority found no hard evidence to support Republican suspicions; it also uncovered no hard evidence to completely refute them.  The dispute has its roots in the Nixon Administration, which publicly declared that no Americans remained in captivity even though there were more than 100 who were last reported to be alive but remain unaccounted for.  The committee found that efforts by the Nixon Administration and its successors to track down reported sightings of live Americans were not always given suitably high priority. But it found no evidence of a cover-up or official conspiracy.  The committee also reported that Vietnam and Cambodia were now cooperating in the search for further evidence. Vietnam's failure to cooperate has been an impediment to normal diplomatic and economic relations.  Hanoi must be held to its new commitments. But Washington can now prudently go ahead on normalization. There's still time for President Bush to act, redeeming the hope he expressed in his inaugural address four years ago that America could at last overcome the bitterness and divisions of the Vietnam War.  If Mr. Bush won't act, it will be up to Bill Clinton to close the last chapter of the Vietnam War. For bringing that end within reach, the Senate committee deserves the nation's thanks.

"   , Vietnam, March 24   Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai says Vietnam has received what he calls ""the first positive sign"" from the United States since the Clinton Administration took office.  In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Mai disclosed that after the massacre of 34 Vietnamese by Khmer Rouge troops in Cambodia on March 10, Hanoi had requested Washington ""to do everything possible"" to prevent such killings. He said the message had been delivered by the departing delegate to the United Nations, Trinh Xuan Lang.  The Deputy Minister said the State Department followed with a strong condemnation of the massacre and a request to United Nations officials in Cambodia to investigate the killings and punish the criminals. He said the United States also urged other Governments to take similar action.  ""We consider the statement quite positive,"" Mr. Mai said. In a further move viewed here as encouraging to Vietnam's efforts toward normalizing relations with the United States, Washington sent a reply to Vietnam concerning its request, and Assistant Secretary of State William Clark received Mr. Lang for a farewell call last week.  Without linking the two actions, Mr. Mai later in the interview cited disapprovingly an official Chinese comment on the massacre. ""China said it 'disapproves,' "" he said. ""They could find a stronger word for murder.""  Vietnamese officials do not hide their eagerness for the Clinton Administration to move toward lifting the trade embargo and the establishment of diplomatic relations. They profess not to be disappointed that Mr. Clinton has not yet stated his intentions.  The Deputy Minister said Hanoi had been told by Americans that the lack of a United States initiative was because of unusual slowness by the Clinton Administration in filling top State Department posts.  Asked whether there was any action that Vietnam planned to prompt an initiative by the new Administration, Mr. Mai said: ""We have done everything possible. We are asking the United States, 'What do you want?' ""  On the main obstacle for normalization, Vietnamese cooperation in the search for 1,654 American servicemen still listed as missing in action, Mr. Mai said Vietnam was continuing ""without interruption"" its ""full cooperation,"" begun under the Bush Administration.  Lieut. Col. Jack Donovan, head of the team of 90 Americans now in Vietnam as part of the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, said in an interview at his headquarters: ""Vietnam at this point in time is increasing the level of cooperation. They are bending over backward to help us. I agree with Vietnam on the progress being made.""  Mr. Mai urged the United States to respond to what Vietnam calls its changed foreign policy since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Hanoi's main ally and source of support.  ""We were strong supporters of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,"" he said. ""In today's situation, we adapt to the changing world. We try everything possible. It's up to the United States to decide: either normalize or prolong this abnormal state.""  Asked to give a personal rather than diplomatic view, Mr. Mai said: ""It's more than 20 years since the Paris Agreement with the United States. We should be in a position to look into the future. If our generation can't solve the issue, it's bad. We should not leave it to the next generation.""   LOAD-DATE: March 25, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",March 22 1993 ,11

Foreign Middlemen Profit  To a degree that the United States Government seems unwilling to admit, the 18-year-old American trade embargo on Vietnam is crumbling.  After generations of Communist central planning, the Hanoi Government is opening its economy to the world. And the technology that Washington had fought for so long to keep out of Vietnamese hands is getting here, usually through third-country middlemen who are delighted to profit from the sale of technology that Americans pioneered but cannot sell in Vietnam themselves.  American business executives eager to profit from one of the developing world's most promising markets insist that they -- not the Vietnamese -- are now the chief victims of the embargo.  'Losing a Market'  Many Vietnamese agree. After years of accusing Washington of using the embargo to force this nation into submission, Vietnamese officials acknowledge that they are now getting most of the technology and foreign investment money that they can use, at least for today.  ""Americans are losing a market of 72 million people that we don't need to lose,"" said James Rockwell, an American business consultant based in Hanoi whose clients include the Chrysler Corporation.  ""Vietnam is not waiting for us anymore,"" he said, the American flag flapping in the humid breeze outside the window of his company's offices here.  ""Capitalism has run amok here, and the Vietnamese have decided to put together an economy with or without us.""  Mr. Rockwell is helping Chrysler prepare to open car manufacturing plants in Vietnam when the embargo is lifted. But there is no guarantee that President Clinton will lift the embargo any time soon.  Japanese Open Factories  And as Mr. Rockwell and Chrysler wait anxiously, Japanese car makers, unencumbered by the embargo and eager for a new beachhead in southeast Asia, are opening their first Vietnamese factories.  The complaints of American businesses ring hollow to the families of some of the more than 2,000 Americans still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.  Their fate is the issue that continues to divide Washington and Hanoi, and organizations representing some of the families say the Vietnamese Government is still giving only grudging cooperation to American military investigators.  Larry W. Rivers, a Vietnam veteran who is the executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a telephone interview from Washington that ""our only concern is whether Vietnam is giving us a full accounting on the missing -- whether the embargo helps or hinders the American business community is not our focus.""  Call for Brown to Quit  On Thursday, an umbrella organization of 75 groups that represent Vietnam veterans or the families of missing Americans called for the resignation of the United States Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, because of accusations that he accepted $700,000 from a Vietnamese businessman to lobby for an end to the trade embargo.  While Mr. Brown has denied the accusations, the controversy could further delay the lifting of the embargo. A group of Republican members of Congress has asked President Clinton to hold off on any move to improve relations with the Vietnamese Government until an investigation of Mr. Brown by a Federal grand jury in Miami is completed.  The American embargo was imposed when the Communist forces of North Vietnam overran the South in 1975. For more than a decade, the sanctions were undeniably effective in punishing Vietnam. Its economy stagnated, both because of the embargo and because of inept Government policies, and Vietnam remains one of the world's poorest nations.  But that is changing rapidly. Vietnam's fortunes began to improve in the late 1980's, when the nation's leaders abandoned Marxist economic theory and accepted free markets under a policy known as doi moi, or renovation.  At the same time, Vietnam moved to placate Washington. It released most of its political prisoners, pulled its troops out of Cambodia and, most important of all, expanded its cooperation in trying to determine the fate of Americans missing from the war.  Embargo Gradually Eased  Washington has gradually eased the embargo. Shortly before he left office, President Bush allowed American firms to open representative offices in Vietnam.  In July, President Clinton decided to lift the American veto that had blocked billions of dollars in loans to Vietnam by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations. Those loans are expected to permit the Vietnamese to begin to rebuild their road network and power plants, and to create a modern telecommunications system.  When the embargo came up for renewal in September, President Clinton decided to allow American businesses to bid on projects financed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  But he kept in place what for most American businesses is the heart of the embargo. With few exceptions, American companies cannot manufacture or sell their goods here, even as their foreign competitors, mostly from Japan and elsewhere in Asia, move quickly to sew up the Vietnamese market before the Americans arrive.  Fear of Antagonizing Veterans  More than 500 international investment projects, worth more than $5 billion, have already been approved by the Vietnamese Government. Only about $55 million of that directly involves American companies.  While eager to move into Vietnam -- with its well-educated, low-wage workers and great natural resources, including oil -- many large American corporations do not take a formal position on the question of whether the United States should lift the embargo.  Their reluctance to fight for an end to the sanctions reflects in part a fear of antagonizing veterans groups or the families of missing Americans. So far only three large American corporations have sent representatives to live in Vietnam -- International Business Machines, General Electric and Price Waterhouse.  I.B.M. is among the companies that take no formal position on the embargo. Still, the company's Hanoi representative, William Howell, who has lived in a hotel room here for the last five months, cannot hide his frustration at having to turn down so many inquiries from customers who are eager to buy his computers.  Frustration Over Lost Sales  ""It's very frustrating to look at a big market that we can't sell to,"" said Mr. Howell, who figures that I.B.M. could reap $50 million in annual sales in Vietnam by the end of the decade if the embargo is lifted.  That is not to say that the company's computers are not for sale in Vietnam. I.B.M. personal computers -- as well as computers made by big American competitors, including Apple and Compac -- are sold openly in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the southern Vietnamese city once known as Saigon, and can be found in use in Government ministries.  ""It's easy to buy an I.B.M. in Vietnam, but we're not the ones selling it,"" grumbled Mr. Howell. American computers are imported by Asian middlemen who rake off much of the profit the manufacturers would otherwise make if they were allowed to sell and service their own computers here.  Among those who cannot buy I.B.M. computers in Vietnam are the large non-American foreign corporations -- banks, airlines, construction companies and the like -- that have set up offices in Hanoi. Many of them are loyal I.B.M. customers elsewhere in the world. But in Vietnam, they are usually forced to buy I.B.M. clones made outside the United States, often in Taiwan or Korea.  Boeing has a similar problem. Under the embargo, it cannot sell its jets to Vietnam Airlines, so the American company's planes must instead be leased to Vietnam by a non-American company that takes much of the profit that would otherwise go to Boeing.  Embargo Hurts Oil Companies  Foreign middlemen bring to Vietnam a vast range of American brand consumer goods, from Eveready batteries to Kleenex tissue, by transshiping them through other Asian countries. Because the embargo has prevented the Hollywood studios from policing the video market here, the latest films are widely available on black market cassettes, smuggled across the border from Cambodia and translated into Vietnamese.  Almost certainly the biggest corporate losers as a result of the embargo are American oil companies, which have been barred in Vietnam from bidding on rich offshore tracts in the South China Sea.  For several years, Vietnamese officials had hinted that they were willing to set aside some of the most promising tracts for the American oil giants. But soon, all of the best oil-drilling zones will be committed to non-American companies.  ""The opportunities for American companies are getting very narrow now,"" said Do Duc Dinh, an economist with Hanoi's Institute of World Economies. ""We want to do business with the Americans. But Vietnam cannot wait forever.""  LOAD-DATE: October 3, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo: American companies can open offices but not sell goods in Hanoi, Vietnam.

"   , Vietnam   Nguyen Lan stands between this 1,000-year-old capital and the wrecking ball that has destroyed so much of the architectural heritage of Southeast Asia. And he would just as soon be standing somewhere else.  ""I know that our Government leaders support preservation of the old city,"" said Mr. Lan, the chief Government architect of Hanoi. ""They know its beauty.""  ""But there are many ideas about what should happen to Hanoi,"" he said as he nervously fingered the architectural designs for a 20-story building that could change the look of the capital forever. ""Some people say that it is not necessary to preserve the old city of Hanoi because it is a symbol of poverty. Some people question whether we would let them starve so that a few of us can admire the beautiful old buildings.""  This tranquil capital of tree-shaded streets and ocher, colonial-era villas set among tiny lakes is under threat from an economic revolution that has the potential of transforming Vietnam from a Communist backwater to one of the economic tigers of Southeast Asia.  The increasingly lonely vigil to save old Hanoi is being led by a handful of Vietnamese officials and foreign friends of the city who want to prevent its gracious if crumbling beauty from being sacrificed in Vietnam's headlong rush to free markets and economic development.  The preservation debate has begun in earnest with the announcement that a Singapore-based development company is planning to erect the city's first tall building, a 20-story tower of luxury apartments, the heart of a $41-million residential and office complex directly across from the Hoan Kiem Lake. Many of Hanoi's three million people consider the lake to be the center of their city.  Also bound for ""redevelopment"" in Hanoi is the site of the colonial-era prison that became known to a generation of Americans as the Hanoi Hilton, because it was there that American prisoners of war were held during the Vietnam War. Those plans are not so far advanced, but there are reports that the prison will be torn down and replaced with a $33-million, five-star hotel.  Where Rivers Join  Hanoi was founded in the 11th century by the Vietnamese King Ly Thai To, who wanted to inaugurate his dynasty by creating a beautiful new capital along the confluence of the Red River and the To Lich River. It has been preserved not because of the work of enlightened urban planners, but because of generations of civil war and economic stagnation in Vietnam.  During the Vietnam War, Hanoi, unlike much of the rest of North Vietnam, was mostly spared the devastation of American bombers. Neighborhoods are little changed in appearance from the era of the great Vietnamese kings or the French colonialists who deposed them.  Vietnam's era of economic stagnation appears to be over, however. With the collapse of its former patron, the Soviet Union, Vietnam has abandoned Marxist economic theory and has embraced the free market. Foreign real estate developers have rushed into Vietnam.  From the beginning, there was less to preserve in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly the southern capital of Saigon, which during the Vietnam War developed a skyline of tall, modern, mostly characterless buildings.  In Hanoi, however, there is little of modern architecture and no very tall buildings -- the city's tallest structure is a six-story office complex that until recently was the only building in the city with an elevator.  Foreign developers say that with land prices exploding in the capital, they are without a cost-effective means of preserving much of the old architecture of Hanoi.  ""It's called progress,"" said Peter Purcell, the Australian developer who is behind Hanoi Plaza, the complex that will include the 20-story building.  ""If Hanoi is going to achieve anything like the importance it seeks as a government and financial center, you will have to have modern buildings,"" he said. ""And the economics of modern buildings hold that if the land is of a certain value, the buildings have to be a certain size. To make omelets in this city, you will have to break some eggs.""  For Hanoi Plaza, the cost of progress will include the demolition of a city landmark, a cavernous, cream-colored two-story department store built by the French in the late 1920's.  A Practical Matter  ""We've been right through the department store and it was quite clear to us that it was impractical to save any of it,"" said Mr. Purcell.  While his project has already received the approval of the Government's foreign investment department, other agencies have not yet signed off including Mr. Lan's office.  ""On a case-by-case basis,"" he said, the city will probably have to approve the construction of a number of high-rise buildings or risk the loss of the foreign investment needed to create a prosperous city.  ""All of the foreign investors want to put their money into projects right in the center of the city, and they only want to build tall buildings,"" he said. ""If we reject them, then maybe the investors will go to Beijing or Seoul or Bangkok. That is not what we want.""

"   , Vietnam   FOR an increasingly corrupt city, Hanoi retains an innocent charm. A request to meet with a government functionary in virtually any other capital in Southeast Asia -- from Bangkok to Jakarta to Phnom Penh -- commonly produces a fellow who, on a pittance of a government salary, somehow manages to drive a Mercedes and to vacation in the south of France.  In the streets of the Vietnamese capital, there are almost no fancy cars. And when Government officials agree to be interviewed they often as not arrive for the meeting out of breath, having pedaled a rickety bicycle across town.  But no one here expects this to go on much longer. The legacy of Ho Chi Minh, who created in Vietnam a pride in Marxist asceticism, appears to be crumbling as this nation heads down a path that could conceivably take it the way of Brezhnev's Soviet Union and Ceausescu's Romania. Officials who still claim to hold dear the idea of Communist sacrifice are in fact bowing down before mammon.  Petty corruption is not new anywhere in Vietnam. The Vietnamese will tell you that there have always been Communist Party officials willing to do favors -- fix a street, find a job, help a neighbor's child into college -- for a small bribe.  The threat now is big-money corruption. It has been a problem for years in the South, in part because there is so much more money, in part because of the culture of corruption left by a succession of South Vietnamese Governments. But it is still relatively new in the North, home to Vietnam's most senior leaders, and it is now spreading so quickly that many in the Hanoi Government admit candidly that corruption could undermine their revolutionary credentials and pose a danger to the Government's survival. They acknowledge that the Government has opened corruption investigations on thousands of officials annually and that, since the early 1980's, nearly 20,000 state employees have been jailed or disciplined for corruption.  The Government -- which retains a firm hold on power despite the collapse of its ideological and financial patron, the Soviet Union -- insists that it is trying to crack down on graft. Hanoi has declared 1993 to be ""Anti-Corruption and Anti-Smuggling Year"" and in January corruption was made a crime punishable by execution.  The army newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan has joined in sounding the alarm, recently warning that several Government officials had already ruined their reputations ""by falling into the trap of privileges, bureaucracy, bribery, waste, self-satisfaction and thinking little of the masses.""  Diplomats and scholars who frequently visit Vietnam agree that the Government has retained a degree of public support because of the perception, rare in the Communist world, that while the ideological heirs of Ho Chi Minh may be misguided as policymakers, they by and large are not thieves.  If that perception is changing, it could prove to be a much bigger threat to the Government than the communications explosion that each day is bringing the Vietnamese more and more information about how people live in the rest of the world.  ""The Vietnamese people have always accepted sacrifice, terrible sacrifice, so long as their leaders sacrificed with them,"" said an Asian diplomat in Hanoi. ""When that equation changes, anything can happen.""  One early victim of the anti-corruption campaign is likely to be the former Energy Minister, Vu Ngoc Hai, who is awaiting trial for graft involving one of the nation's largest public works projects, a $200 million, 900-mile electrical power line that is heavy with symbolism because it is being built along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the wartime supply route.  Government investigators say that companies run by the Energy Ministry submitted falsified invoices to the Government for 4,000 tons of steel for the project but delivered only 2,000 tons. At least $300,000 is said to be missing.  Rising corruption is in a sense a sign of the growing economic might of Vietnam, a nation that with its diligent, well-educated labor force and vast natural resources is being touted as Asia's next economic tiger. There is suddenly in Vietnam enough opportunity to make it worth the while of Vietnamese businessmen and foreign investors to throw dirty money in the path of decision-makers. The senior customs officer in Ho Chi Minh City, which is still called Saigon by most of its inhabitants, was sentenced a few weeks ago to life in prison for taking bribes to allow Hong Kong businessmen to smuggle gold through the airport.  In a twist, there is now the accusation that dirty money is also being thrown in the path of influential foreigners who could help Vietnam. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is under scrutiny by a Federal grand jury in Miami over accusations that he may have sought a bribe in exchange for his help in ending the American trade embargo on Vietnam. Mr. Brown has described the accusations as absurd.  Do Duc Dinh, an economist with Hanoi's Institute on World Economies, said the corruption problem is now so serious that, by warping the Government's decision-making process, it could undermine the free-market reforms that are promising to bring Vietnam billions of dollars in foreign investment.  ""Everywhere there are examples of corruption,"" he said. ""You want to have a phone installed? If you put your name on the official list, you'll have to wait for several months. But if you want the phone now, you can have it if you pay $400"" -- a huge bribe in a country where per capita income is only about $200 a year.  ""Before in Vietnam, you could get something done by knowing the right person,"" he said. ""Now, you can't just know the right person -- you also have to be willing to pay.""

"    The traditional Vietnamese costume known as the ao dai is said by the Vietnamese to hide everything -- and to hide nothing. Everything, because it is a full-length, high-neck tunic that covers almost every inch of a woman's body. Nothing, because it is so close-fitting that it leaves little to the imagination.  The ao dai is worn for formal occasions. And in Hue, home to Vietnam's 19th-century emperors and the geographical and spiritual heart of the nation, the locals can think of no lovelier sight than the one offered to them on festival mornings, when groups of young women pedal their bicycles down the misty emerald banks of the Perfume River, their long ao dais fluttering in the chill morning breeze, their fair skin shielded from the early sun by elbow-length gloves and conical bamboo hats.  ""When they arrive here, the tourists think that maybe we Vietnamese are like the Chinese, that we all wear Mao suits and do not understand the beauty of the human form,"" our tour guide told us, a bit touchily. ""But we had no Cultural Revolution here. We never told the painters to stop painting. There is romance in everything we do. Even if the romance sometimes has an unhappy ending.""  The romance of Vietnam has long been a dark one -- stained, or at least tinted, by the blood and gunpowder spilled during a century spent mostly at war. But it is romance to be sure: haunted, sensual, knowing. And today it is the romance of Vietnam that is attracting a new generation of travelers -- photographers and film makers, fashion designers and writers -- to a nation of nearly 72 million people that has decided after years of isolation to open itself again to the world.  What is perhaps most surprising about the Vietnamese is that they do not define themselves by what Westerners know as the Vietnam War. Vietnam is an ancient land, and for many Vietnamese, the war fought with the Americans was just one, and not even the most recent, in a long succession of armed struggles that drove off the colonialists and unified the nation.  ""There have been so many wars,"" said a Hanoi shopkeeper, ticking off the enemies she has known in her lifetime on her fingers. ""We have fought the Japanese, the French, the Americans, the Khmer Rouge and then the Chinese. And now,"" she sighed heavily, ""our enemy is poverty.""  Americans who travel to Vietnam -- even to Hanoi, the old enemy stronghold in the north -- find a gracious welcome. And no one is moving faster to put the war behind them than the people of Ho Chi Minh City, the former southern capital that most residents never stopped calling Saigon.  After years of deprivation following the war, big money has returned to Saigon, and evenings in Ho Chi Minh City are scented once more with the sweet, citrusy perfume that southern women adore and with the garlicky aroma of cha gio -- the delicious crab-filled spring rolls that are on the menu of most of the city's pricey new open-air restaurants.  The waterfront along the sinuous Saigon River has been converted into a giant construction site as the southern Vietnamese, who remember how capitalism works and who never lost their taste for Coca-Cola and blue jeans, profit from the recent free-market reforms of a Government that, though avowedly Marxist, has discovered pragmatism.  While Ho Chi Minh City is brash and business-mad, Hanoi, the thousand-year-old capital, has an entirely different temperament. About 900 miles north, Hanoi is somber and proud -- and arguably the most beautiful capital in Southeast Asia. It is a city of narrow, willow-shaded streets and rows of cream-colored colonial villas that are, along with crusty baguettes and cafe filtre, the legacy of this nation's former French masters.  Hanoi remains a special treasure to the French, who arrive here today by the planeload on journeys of nostalgia, mournful and joyous. It is not uncommon to find a few aging French soldiers in the candlelit dining room of the lovingly restored Metropole Hotel, raising a toast first to the soldiers who died in the terrible military defeats that France suffered in Vietnam, and then to the Vietnamese and their future. ""A Frenchman comes to Hanoi and he sees these graceful buildings, and it is a bit of France in Asia, "" said a retired French colonel from Lyons. ""We lost in Vietnam,"" he continued without remorse, ""but we still celebrate it.""  Hanoi is best seen from the passenger seat of one of the three-wheeled pedicabs or cyclopousses, which are found for hire on almost every street corner. The friendly drivers all know the way to the home of ""Bac Ho"" -- Uncle Ho. In this tiny wooden house, among the banyan and milkwood trees in the center of town, Hanoi's quiet elegance is most in evidence. For years it was the peaceful retreat of Ho Chi Minh, the wispy-whiskered revolutionary who, alone among Communist leaders of his day, still inspires affection among his countrymen.  Hue, on the other hand, was home to a series of feudal lords who ruled over this ancient city from the 16th century until 1802, when one of them -- Gia-Long -- decided that he was worthy of ruling all of Vietnam, establishing a dynasty that would last until the end of the Second World War.  In the pine-covered hills surrounding the river, the Nguyen Dynasty created a landscape of architectural magnificence, as seen from one of the 40-foot sampans that ply the Perfume River in virtual silence. The boats brush past citadels and pagodas, none more awe-inspiring than the royal tombs, built by the nation's kings to house their earthly remains. The mausoleum of Emperor Tu Duc is a palace in miniature, with two wooden Chinese style pavilions set beside a long, lotus-filled lake. Court histories suggest that the emperor liked to sit for hours in the shade of his pavilions, writing poetry or fishing as he drank cups of bitter green tea made with dew.  For many years after the war, travelers to Vietnam, stymied by the need for special travel permits obtained only after much bureaucratic wrangling, rarely saw places like Hue. But in just the last several months, the rules have changed. The Government, still suspicious of foreigners but eager for the hard currency they carry, has lifted the requirement for permits, and there is now the chance to see almost all of what rests between Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.  Now there is the opportunity to discover a vast nation of rain forest and jungle; of terraced rice paddies set among craggy limestone hills; of fishing communities dotted along beaches whose brilliant white sands rival the best of Bali or Kauai. Here is the Vietnam of barefoot farmers marching behind armies of squawking ducks, of young boys screaming with frenzied delight as they dive off the backs of water buffaloes into the cool rivers of the interior valleys.  Anyone looking for reminders of war will find them -- displayed on the walls of family living rooms in the North, where the red-bordered Government certificates list loved ones killed in battle; in the 20-year-old bomb craters that are today used as watering holes.  But ask the Vietnamese about the war, and the response is nearly always the same: ""The war is over,"" said a schoolteacher, pushing back his bamboo hat to brush away the sweat of an afternoon's toil on his family's small farm in the northern Red River delta. ""I am 22 and my wife is 20, and we do not even remember the war. We honor the people who died, but we agree with our leaders when they say that it is time for Vietnam to end its isolation -- it is time to put aside the war.""  And perhaps, he might have added, it is time that the rest of the world allowed them to.

"    More than 20 years after the last American troops left Vietnam, a sullen shadow war still rages. Psyches on both sides remain haunted by extravagant suspicions, diplomats barely communicate, and unfortunate people trapped in the middle can pay a heavy price.  One such person is Do Ngoc Long, imprisoned and persecuted by Hanoi for his associations with anti-war Americans -- and now rebuffed by Washington in his quest for political asylum in the U.S. It would be particularly appropriate if President Clinton intervened directly in the asylum case and spared Mr. Long further torments.  During the war years, Mr. Long worked with the ""Shoeshine Boys"" project, organized by American conscientious objectors to help homeless children in Saigon and Danang. To Hanoi hard-liners, it was inconceivable that Washington would have tolerated Americans participating in such a project unless they were really secret U.S. agents.  Despite economic reforms, that kind of hard-line political mentality still persists in Vietnamese police agencies. In 1990, Mr. Long was arrested on suspicion of ""activities detrimental to the national security."" The allegation was based on his supposed cooperation with another anti-war American trying to end the U.S. embargo against Vietnam.  After three years' imprisonment and a campaign of denunciations in the official media, Mr. Long was released last April. Both the Bush and Clinton Administrations had told Hanoi that they were concerned about Mr. Long, and the approval of his application for entry to the U.S. as a refugee seemed a logical next step.  Yet in August, the Immigration and Naturalization Service turned him down, suggesting that he go through the years-long process of applying for an immigrant visa. According to narrow procedural guidelines, Mr. Long's arrest was too recent to qualify as clearly political. Yet the propaganda campaign against him suggests that he remains highly vulnerable so long as he stays in Vietnam.  Fortunately, however, the Immigration Service is ultimately accountable to a President familiar with the powerful emotions of the Vietnam War and the independence of Americans who opposed it. Mr. Clinton can help rescue Mr. Long from the cruel shadow war.  LOAD-DATE: November 26, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",November 26 1993 ,11

Vietnam turned over eight sets of remains of missing Americans on Monday; it has turned over 67 sets of remains this year.  The United States lists 2,248 Americans still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia after the Vietnam War, including 1,648 in Vietnam, 514 in Laos, 78 in Cambodia and 8 in China.  United States officials have said it is unlikely there will ever be a full accounting because of the passage of time and the fact that many airmen went down over water or mountains.  President Clinton has made a full lifting of the United States trade embargo against Vietnam and the establishment of diplomatic relations contingent on the fullest possible accounting.

"   , Vietnam, Dec. 19   The first coordinated American-Vietnamese-Laotian search for Americans missing in action ended Sunday with mixed results.  Searchers discovered new remains and helicopter wreckage but they were able to complete only about two-thirds of their cases because of three tropical storms that battered central Vietnam. The search began Dec. 3.  The 44 Americans working in Laos and Vietnam headed to Bangkok for a brief stopover before moving on to their home base in Honolulu. They are members of the Joint Task Force Full Accounting based at Camp H. M. Smith in Hawaii.  Remains Are Found  The Americans excavated a site in Xepon District of Savannakhet Province in Laos and uncovered human remains and wreckage of an Air Force search-and-rescue helicopter that was shot down with five men aboard in 1970.  On the Vietnam side of the border, a witness led the investigators to what he said was the burial site of an American in the A Shau Valley, a major North Vietnamese base west of Da Nang during the war. An excavation team dug up the remains and Lt. Col. David L. Fredrikson, a United States Army spokesman, confirmed that they are believed to be of an American.  Colonel Fredrikson said helicopter flights were curtailed by the weather and the American teams were able to check out only roughly 40 of the 56 cases they had set out to investigate.  He said more coordinated three-country operations would be carried out in the future along the Vietnam-Laos border to finish the cases that the American teams did not get to and to look into scores of others. He gave no timetable.  Hundreds of American airmen were downed in the region in the 1960's and 1970's during operations along the Ho Chi Minh Trail aimed at stopping North Vietnamese trucks and troops moving southward into South Vietnam.  The United States lists a total of 2,239 Americans as still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, including 1,648 in Vietnam, 505 in Laos, 78 in Cambodia and 8 in China.  American officials have said it is unlikely that there will ever be a full accounting, citing the amount of time that has passed and the fact that many of the missing servicemen were shot down over water or in mountainous terrain.  Last Monday, Hanoi turned over to the United States the remains of eight Americans found during searches in October and November.  At the same time, it handed a high-level delegation led by Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord new documents on missing servicemen that are being analyzed now.  ""They are cooperating at a very high level,"" said Mr. Lord.  LOAD-DATE: December 20, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 20 1993 ,11
"      In its first policy decision on Vietnam, the Clinton Administration will send John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general, to Hanoi on a fact-finding mission on missing American servicemen, a move that could lead the United States to withdraw its opposition to international bank lending to Vietnam, senior Administration officials said today.  The officials stressed that President Clinton will make no decision on easing any American pressure on Vietnam until he is convinced that Hanoi is doing all it can to cooperate with the American authorities on the contentious and emotional issue of Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  But the Administration is trying to work out the broad outlines of a Vietnam policy before late April, when the International Monetary Fund will decide whether to take steps toward resuming lending to Hanoi. France, Germany, Japan and a number of Asian nations are poised to lend Vietnam enough money to repay its longstanding I.M.F. debts, which could allow Vietnam to qualify for new loans.  The new Administration is caught between its isolation on the loan issue and its desire to increase Vietnam's commercial dealings with the rest of the world on the one hand, and the reluctance of Mr. Clinton, who opposed the Vietnam War and did not serve in the military, to take any step that would expose him to criticism that he is soft on Vietnam.  Mr. Clinton cannot afford another bruising battle, given the controversy over his own military record and the furor over the issue of whether to lift the ban on allowing declared homosexuals to serve in the military.  For his part, Secretary of State Warren Christopher is keenly aware that Vietnam, a country of 70 million people, is a great untapped business opportunity, one he does not want American businesses to lose to foreign competitors. Liberal and even some conservative lawmakers have begun calling for more liberalized relations with Hanoi.  But senior Administration officials stress that even if the United States were to end its opposition to international loans to Vietnam, lifting the 18-year-old American trade embargo is another matter, and would happen only slowly and in stages. Some senior officials speak of the possibility of an eventual economic relationship with Vietnam but no full-scale normalization of diplomatic relations.  General's New Mission  In a question-and-answer session after a speech on American foreign policy, Mr. Christopher raised expectations that the United States might lift the embargo. Asked about the American approach to the embargo, he repeated the Administration's conditions, but said, ""It's unfortunate that many other countries around the world are getting ahead of us in their commercial endeavors in Vietnam and I hope that we can enable our businesses and industries to catch up by moving more rapidly down the road.""  General Vessey, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who was the Bush Administration's special envoy to Hanoi, will seek detailed information on a range of issues, including full American access to Vietnam's archives, the resolution of outstanding cases where there are discrepancies in reports, and the return of the remains of American soldiers. The Administration acknowledges Vietnam's increased cooperation in the last 18 months, but there are differences between senior officials over the lending issue.  When asked on Thursday about the pending vote at the I.M.F., one senior Administration official said, ""I think the United States Government hopes very much to be in a position to join the group that is positive about the situation in Vietnam."" But he added that Mr. Clinton is firmly committed to insuring that the United States gets all the available information on the missing Americans.  Vietnam's Burden of Proof  Other senior officials involved in the decision said that they were not yet satisfied that Vietnam had fully cooperated on the issue and that the burden of proof was on the Vietnamese.  Even some of the most conservative members of Congress have urged the new Administration to make a concrete gesture toward the Hanoi Government.  ""I've been a hard-liner in a lot of ways,"" Senator Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican, said last month during the Senate confirmation hearing of Winston Lord as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. ""I'm a Vietnam veteran and served two tours there,"" he said. But he added that the time has come for President Clinton to ""recognize Vietnam.""  Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, who recently issued a comprehensive report on the fate of several hundred American servicemen missing since the Vietnam war, asked Mr. Lord to explain why the new Administration was so willing to engage with China as a way to push for change there, but took a ""don't be involved"" approach toward Vietnam.  Last fall, the Bush Administration made conciliatory gestures toward Vietnam after receiving what officials considered extraordinary assistance in identifying missing Americans. Mr. Bush allowed American companies to open offices in Vietnam and to sign agreements that would take effect as soon as the United States lifted the embargo, but he left the White House without doing so.

"      A document described as a top secret report written by a senior North Vietnamese general and delivered to the Communist Party Politburo in Hanoi in September 1972 says that North Vietnam was holding 1,205 American prisoners of war when Hanoi maintained that the number was only 368.  A copy of the report, a Russian translation of the Vietnamese document, was recently discovered here in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party.  The report has been circulated among United States Government officials. It has been described as authentic by experts, some of whom have called it a ""smoking gun"" that proves Hanoi has been withholding information about the fate of American prisoners of war in Vietnam.  Discovered in January by a Harvard University researcher, the document gives a detailed accounting of 1,205 prisoners held in 11 North Vietnamese prisons in the fall of 1972, at a time when the peace talks were under way in Paris.  The author of the report, General Tran Van Quang, then Deputy Chief of Staff of the North Vietnamese Army, said in the document: ""1,205 American prisoners of war located in the prisons of North Vietnam -- this is a big number. Officially, until now, we published a list of only 368 prisoners of war, the rest we have not revealed. The Government of the U.S.A. knows this well, but it does not know the exact number of prisoners of war, and can only make guesses based on its losses. That is why we are keeping the number of prisoners of war secret, in accordance with the Politburo's instructions.""  Several months later, under the peace agreement between North Vietnam and the United States, 591 P.O.W.'s were released. When the last of those prisoners were freed on April 1, 1973, Hanoi said that no more American prisoners were left in Vietnam -- an assertion that it has maintained.  But the Sept. 12, 1972, report suggests that North Vietnam was either withholding prisoners after the peace agreement was reached or, if the prisoners were no longer alive, knew about their fate.  More Than 700 Held Back  ""On the basis of this, we can conclude that more than 700 Americans had been held back by the Vietnamese at the time of Operation Homecoming,"" said Stephen J. Morris, a 44-year-old researcher for the Harvard Center for International Affairs and the Russian Research Center at Harvard, who discovered the document.  ""This is the biggest hostage-taking in the history of American foreign policy and we still don't know where the hostages are, what happened to them, if they are still alive,"" said Mr. Morris, who is working on his second book about the Vietnam War.  Members of a American-Russian commission investigating the fate of other American P.O.W.'s, captured by either the Soviet Union or its allies, say the document is authentic. The Russian newspaper Izvestia reported Saturday that the document on the American prisoners in Vietnam, along with other newly declassified material, was discussed at a recent closed meeting of the commission.  The document could complicate Hanoi's efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the United States and have Washington end its 18-year trade embargo. The White House announced Saturday that John W. Vessey Jr. a retired general, would visit Vietnam on April 18 and 19 to assess Hanoi's cooperation in accounting for missing servicemen.  Marked 'Top Secret' in Russian  The document, found in the Communist Party archives, consists of both a Russian translation of General Quang's full report and a summary prepared by the Soviet Army Intelligence Agency. It is marked ""Top Secret"" in Russian, and on the first page of the summary it shows handwritten instructions for a ""brief note . . . on the prisoners of war"" to be dispatched to the Soviet Politburo.  Experts on the issue, which has haunted relatives of servicemen listed as missing in action and a succession of Washington Administrations, say one element strongly suggesting that the document is authentic is the reference to the figure of 368, which was the number of P.O.W.'s given to American representatives at the Paris peace talks. Furthermore, one Congressional expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the number of 1,205 more or less corresponds to the number of prisoners the United States was expecting to see returned.  The United States still lists more than 2,200 servicemen from the Vietnam War as unaccounted for, although more than half were known to have died. The Government says the fate of the others is not known.  A Senate committee that investigated the issue reported in January that ""there is no proof that United States P.O.W.'s survived, but neither is there proof that all of those who did not return had died.""  Mr. Morris said he first showed the report to top White House officials in February. According to a person who works for a Senate committee, a report on the Soviet document was delivered to President Clinton on the eve of his meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia in Vancouver on April 3 and 4. It is not known whether the subject was raised at the meeting.  No White House Evaluation Yet  A Clinton Administration official said tonight of the report of the document, ""We are pursuing it very seriously but are not in a position to evaluate it.""  He also said that the American researcher had informed the Government of his discovery but that ""he would not give us the document.""  He added that the former Ambassador to Moscow, Malcolm Toon, had been asked to follow up the matter in Moscow. As to its impact on United States-Vietnamese relations, the official said, ""I assume it is something Vessey will raise.""  Alan C. Ptak, former Department of Defense Deputy Assistant Secretary for P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, said tonight that he had not heard of the document but that he did not find it surprising. ""I always had an inkling that we hadn't been told everything,"" he said. ""We had suspicions the Russians knew more than they were telling us.""  In his report, General Quang said the prisoners could be freed only as a part of an overall peace settlement and could be used as leverage to obtain compensation for the devastation caused by the war.

"      The White House promised today that a Presidential envoy would press Vietnam next week for an explanation of a previously secret document suggesting that Hanoi held 1,205 United States prisoners of war in 1972, three times more than it admitted then or later.  The document, found in January by an American researcher in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow, could prove politically explosive if it is authentic, because it suggests that more than 600 American prisoners were killed, died of natural causes or remain in Vietnamese hands.  Only 591 prisoners were released by Hanoi under the peace agreement with the United States, the last on April 1, 1973, and Hanoi has denied holding any more.   The Astronaut Question  Some details in the document, a Russian translation of a report by Gen. Tran Van Quang, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the North Vietnamese Army, appear to call its authority into question. It speaks, for example, of three prisoners of war who had undergone astronaut training; available records do not show the loss of any such men. [Excerpts from the report, page A6.]  But other details seem to match the historical record. For example, the document says that at the time, Hanoi had admitted to holding only 368 prisoners; that was the number proffered to American negotiators in 1972.  Zbigniew Brzezinski, who served as national security adviser under President Carter, was one of the Soviet experts who told the document's discoverer, Stephen J. Morris, of Harvard University, that he thought it was authentic.  Finding an Echo of 1940  Mr. Brzezinski said in an interview today after studying the document that although he had no concrete evidence, he believed that ""the great likelihood is that the Vietnamese took hundreds of American officers out and shot them in cold blood, in a massacre like the one in the Katyn woods.""  In the Katyn massacre in 1940, more than 4,500 Polish officers were slain in a forest near Smolensk. Their bodies were discovered by the Nazi invaders in April 1943, and Mikhail S. Gorbachev admitted in 1990 that the Soviet secret police had been responsible.  The Clinton Administration received a copy of the document from Moscow only last Thursday, officials said, and they have not fully analyzed it. Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said it would be discussed with Vietnamese leaders by John W. Vessey, a retired Army general who will visit Hanoi next week. Some officials suggested that General Vessey's trip had been slightly delayed because of the need to explore the implications of the document.  ""There can be no normalization of relations with Vietnam until we're sure that the Vietnamese are doing all they can,"" Ms. Myers declared.  Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who headed a Senate committee that issued an inconclusive report on P.O.W.'s in January, said: ""If this thing is really accurate, and really shows that the Vietnamese held that many American prisoners, it is a very powerful document. It is the smoking gun.""  In a telephone interview from his office in Boston, Mr. Kerry questioned whether all of the 1,205 prisoners mentioned in the document were really Americans, or whether some of them might have been Lao, Thai or Korean and lumped in with the Americans because they were allies of the Americans. He also expressed concern about the ranks attributed to the prisoners.  ""In North Vietnam we captured 624 American fliers, including 7 colonels, 85 lieutenant colonels and 183 majors,"" the report says; Mr. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran, said those numbers may be too high. But four United States Air Force colonels shot down over Vietnam were among those released in 1973, and three others are on the list of those unaccounted for.  Checking the Names  The document contains several names, including those of pilots who supposedly had 4,000 hours of flight time when shot down. But the names are incomplete or incomprehensible, having been rendered from English into Vietnamese, then into Russian, then back into English, a transformation involving three alphabets.  It also mentions ""Jim Katlo, captured in the environs of Hanoi,"" as one of those who had been trained and certified for future space flights.  No name even remotely resembling Katlo appears on any United States Government list of those captured or missing. And Adm. Richard H. Truly, the former astronaut and administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said he had no knowledge of any astronauts who had been shot down or taken prisoner in Vietnam.  Some may have taken a few astronaut-training courses as part of other programs, he said, but they were never classified as trainee astronauts.  Washington's Tally  A total of 2,219 American soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen are still carried on Pentagon rolls as missing in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. More than half are known to have died, but their bodies have not been recovered. The remains of 323 have been returned to the United States since 1973.  Mr. Brzezinski, a leading Soviet scholar, said he had been struck by three things in the document: its style, which he said corresponded to other reports of a similar nature; the number 1,205, which he said ""corresponds to about what the United States government was then expecting to be returned,"" and what he termed ""the Katyn-like classification system.""  ""At the Katyn woods, they specially selected members of the Polish aristocracy,"" he said, ""and here you have the same kind of ominous pattern, with prisoners being classified according to their degree of intransigence in refusing to condemn the war. They say the officers come from rich families, which explains their attitude.""  Fear May Have Been a Motive  Mr. Brzezinski and several others speculated that the Vietnamese may have concealed the existence of the other prisoners after the peace agreement because they feared that the United States would re-enter the war, or perhaps because they planned to seek financial reparations.  At some point, these analysts suggested, Hanoi recognized that the prisoners were no longer bargaining counters, but it was unwilling to admit that it had lied for so long.  ""I can only speculate,"" Mr. Brzezinski said, ""but I think the chances are very small that any more than a few might have been kept alive until now.""  Mr. Morris, 44, is affiliated with the Russian Research Center at Harvard. A month after making his discovery, in February, he told Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser at the White House, but he did not give Mr. Berger the text. That arrived only on April 8, after Malcolm Toon, a former ambassador who has been working with the Russians on the P.O.W. question, obtained it in Moscow at Washington's request.  In a telephone interview shortly after he arrived at Kennedy Airport from Moscow, Mr. Morris said he had withheld the text because he feared it would be leaked and because he thought that would put an end to his research.  ""This is the beginning of the story, not the end,"" he said. ""I'm convinced the answers are there, in Moscow, but will we get them now?""  Mr. Morris said that he had placed dozens of calls to senior Government officials since his talk with Mr. Berger, hoping for help in his quest, but that none had been returned. White House officials said they had been unwilling to cooperate with someone unwilling to show them the document.  The most clear-cut reaction to the document, whose existence was reported Saturday in Izvestia and today in The New York Times, came from the grassroots. Liz Flick, a regional coordinator in the Midwest for the National League of Families, said her reaction was ""total devastation.""  ""We were not happy with the number that came back in 1973,"" she said.  ""To know that we were right doesn't make it any better.""

"      Following are excerpts from a report said to have been written by Gen. Tran Van Quang of North Vietnam to the Communist Party Politburo, dated Sept. 15, 1972, saying Hanoi was holding far more American prisoners of war than it had acknowledged. The English translation was provided by Stephen J. Morris, a researcher for the Harvard Center for International Affairs and the Russian Research Center at Harvard, who discovered the report in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow.  Because the report had been translated from the Vietnamese to Russian and then into English, the spelling of the names of Americans in the report is dubious.  Dear comrades: the question of the American prisoners of war is extremely complex. All of international public opinion, and even the public opinion of fraternal socialist countries and our own, wants to know exactly the number of prisoners located in North Vietnam.  Permit me to report to you concretely on this question. Up until now, since the U.S.A. brought its war to Vietnam, expanded the running of its air war to North Vietnam, and also expanded the scope of its aggressive war as a whole, transferring it to the territory of Laos and Cambodia, we have captured on the fronts of Indochina a very large number of American prisoners of war.  Earlier the number of American prisoners of war was not very great, and world public opinion gave it little attention. However, after 5 August 1964, the imperialists of the U.S.A. began the massive airbombing and bombardment by the ships of the Seventh Fleet on the territory of North Vietnam, and after expanding the aggressive war on the territory of Laos and Cambodia, the number of American prisoners of war in North Vietnam grew from day to day.  The End of a Secret  Until the present time the number of American prisoners of war in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has not been published, and we have kept this figure secret. At today's meeting of the Politburo I present you, comrades, with the exact number of American prisoners of war.  The complete number of American prisoners of war, captured to this day on the fronts of Indochina, that is, in North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, stands at 1,205 men; of those, 671 men were captured in North Vietnam and 143 fliers in South Vietnam. Thus the general number of fliers and saboteurs (American advisers on saboteur ships and divers) captured on the territory of North and South Vietnam stands at 814 men. Besides this, from the other categories of American servicemen in Indochina, we captured 391 men, including: in South Vietnam, 283; in Cambodia, 65; in Laos, 43 men; 814 and 391 add up to 1,205 people.  Here are several more facts about the 1,205 prisoners of war:  In North Vietnam we captured 624 American fliers, including 7 colonels, 85 lieutenant colonels, 183 majors; that is, the total number of senior officers in the Air Force and Naval forces stands at 275 men.  In the number of 624 American fliers are included three cosmonauts, that is, three people passed the suitable training for future cosmic flights, for example, Jim Katlo, captured in the environs of Hanoi. In this number is included also, of the U.S.A.F., with more than 4,000 hours of operations each, Norman Klarvisto, Karmet, Jim Intist Shasht and others. These are concrete statistics about the American fliers, captured in North Vietnam.  The 36 'Saboteurs'  Among another 47 prisoners captured in North Vietnam are 36 advisers of saboteur detachments who gave themselves up in the region of the border between the D.R.V. and Laos -- individual saboteurs undertaking reconnaissance of our transport thoroughfares with helicopters, reconnaissance ships -- and several sailors who had fallen into the sea off ships damaged by us and were picked up. Thus the number of 624 and 47 comes to 671.  In South Vietnam, from the flying crews of the U.S.A., we captured 143 people, basically pilots of helicopters, plus some jet-aircraft pilots.  In the number of 391 American armed servicemen captured in South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are 19 colonels, 19 lieutenant colonels and 52 majors. The remaining are officers from captain and below, and also American soldiers.  Thus, summing up, I recall once again, that the number of 1,205 military prisoners of the U.S.A. who at the present time are being held in prisons in North Vietnam, include:  *Fliers captured in North Vietnam, 624.  *Fliers captured in South Vietnam, 143.  *Saboteurs and other American military servicemen captured in North Vietnam, 47.  *American military servicemen of other categories, 391 men, including: captured in South Vietnam, 283; in Cambodia, 65; in Laos, 43 persons.  They are all now located in prisons in North Vietnam. We have now 11 prisons where American prisoners of war are being held. Earlier there were four prisons, but after the attempts of the Americans to liberate their prisoners of war in Son Tay, we increased the number of prisons to 11. In each of these is held approximately 100 American prisoners of war.  Seven colonels of the Air Force captured in North Vietnam, and nine colonels of various kinds of forces captured in South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia (in all 16 officers), we are holding together and we are working on, in order to investigate well the conditions developing in the American army, to obtain necessary materials and information, and to define our attitude toward them.  We are also holding 104 American lieutenant colonels in one place and we are working with them for the receipt of materials, secret information and the disposition of forces and information concerning the Ministry of Defense of the U.S.A.; 235 majors are concentrated in two places.  Thus some senior officers of the American army were separated in special prisons: one for colonels, one for lieutenant colonels and two for majors. In the other prisons were marked remaining prisoners of war in rank from captain and down.  The 368 'Progressives'  Several words about the political positions and orientations of the American prisoners of war: 368 prisoners of war are of progressive orientation. They understand well that this war and their side is wrong and unpopular. They condemn the American Government and express decisive protest against this war.  These 368 prisoners of war we will be able to free in the first instance under the conditions in which -- as a result of the struggle of the progressive people of the world, including the American people -- favorable international circumstances develop, at which time Nixon will be compelled to a decision on the political question.  In this category of prisoners of war, we are undertaking work for the purpose of explaining to them the aggressive substance of the war being conducted by the Nixon Government, the essence of the regime of Nguyen Van Thieu -- but also in their understanding of the unjust character of this war, which is bringing great damage to the American people. . . .  The 372 'Neutralists'  Three hundred seventy-two people among the prisoners of war are holding neutralist views, that is, their political point of view is not fully progressive, but also not very reactionary. We see well that they still insufficiently ascribe a clear role for the American Government in the unleashing of the aggressive war in Indochina.  The remaining hold reactionary views. In spite of our work, spending time with them for the purpose of explaining to them their real situation, they have not changed their reactionary views.  In summary, let us put together the following picture:  *368 prisoners of war holding progressive views can be freed in the first instance.  *372 prisoners of war holding a neutralist position.  *465 prisoners of war holding reactionary views.  All the . . . senior officers hold reactionary views, that is, they do not condemn Nixon, they do not express protest against his policy and they falsify our course. We understand that these officers come from rich families. It is precisely this that explains their reactionary views.  We understand well that the question of the American prisoners of war has great significance in the resolution of the South Vietnamese problem. We must continue propaganda and educational work with the American prisoners of war, to get their understanding not only of the essence of the aggressive war, which brings the U.S.A. to Vietnam, but also of the senseless obstinacy of Nixon, which is only delaying the time of the liberation of the prisoners of war and their return to the motherland.  In the near future we will free several prisoners of war from here, in order to put pressure on the Nixon Government, to see its reaction and the reaction of American society, but also for the purpose of demonstrating our good intentions in this matter.                                      .  .  .   What the U.S. Must Do  The question of the American prisoners of war, as is well known, we intend to resolve in the following manner:  1. The Government of the U.S.A. must demonstrate compliance, that is, to a cease-fire and to remove Nguyen Van Thieu, and then both sides will set about discussion of the question of the return of the prisoners of war to the Nixon Government.  2. At this time, until the American side settles the foregoing problem, we will be able to free only a few of the fliers from the number of progressive orientation. Nixon cannot stand in the way of the return of these fliers to the motherland. . . .  3. Nixon must compensate North Vietnam for those enormous losses which the destructive war caused.  These are the principles on the basis of which we are able to resolve the question of the American prisoners of war. However, Nixon as usual is stubborn in the settlement of the Vietnamese question, and hence is dragging out the resolution of the question.                                      .  .  .  At this very moment we have managed to obtain data about American weapons, and also very valuable scientific materials about the army of the U.S.A., for example, materials about the utilization of various sort of armaments, the tactical-technical character of aircraft, the instructions of the Air Force, and also materials about various other sorts of weaponry of the army of the U.S.A.  The 'Correct' Position  We have managed to guess the plans of the U.S.A. in the international arena and on a series of other questions connected with the war in Indochina. Thus we are certain that our position on the question of the prisoners of war was and remains correct.  . . .  One thousand two hundred and five prisoners of war located in the prisons of North Vietnam -- this is a big number. Officially until now we published a list of only 368 prisoners of war; the remainder we have not revealed.  The Government of the U.S.A. knows well about this, but does not know the exact number of prisoners of war, and is able only to surmise approximately about them on the basis of its losses.  That is why in accordance with the instructions of the politburo we are keeping secret the numbers of prisoners of war.  LOAD-DATE: April 13, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo: Stephen J.

"      Pentagon officials cautioned today against putting too much stock in a newly unearthed document that suggests that North Vietnam lied about the number of American prisoners it held in 1972.  But advocates for the families of missing servicemen rushed to embrace the document's findings.  The authenticity of the seven-page document has become the focus of the continuing debate over the number of P.O.W.'s at the end of the Vietnam War.  Pentagon officials, noting that the document is an English translation of a Russian version of what a Soviet-era note described as a Vietnamese report, said the public should not accept it until a Vietnamese version was found.  ""There are a lot of questions we have about it,"" said Bob Hall, a Department of Defense spokesman. ""But until we get a chance to discuss those with the Vietnamese and raise them and try to get answers to them, it would be inappropriate for me to discuss them in public.""  The report, supposedly written by Gen. Tran Van Quang, who is described as deputy chief of staff of the North Vietnamese Army, said Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners in September 1972. In early 1973, under the terms of a peace agreement, Hanoi released 591 American prisoners and has maintained ever since that no more were held.  But Vietnamese officials and representatives of groups who advocate reconciliation between Washington and Hanoi note a number of discrepancies, including an assertion that some prisoners were segregated by rank. Freed prisoners reported that officers and enlisted men were never separated.  ""Our own P.O.W.'s said that the Vietnamese did not classify and segregate officers from enlisted men,"" said John Terzano, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, which seeks rapprochement between the United States and Vietnam.  But Stephen J. Morris, the Harvard researcher who found the document, said that if officers were segregated, men in other jails would not have known about them. He acknowledged, however, that this contention would hold only if no segregated officers were ever released.  Differences have also arisen over the status of General Quang. Vietnamese officials said today that General Quang was not a senior officer at the time of the report and would not have been in a position to write it.  Biography of a General  But according to Douglas Pike, director of the Indochina Archive at the University of California at Berkeley, General Quang was Deputy Minister of National Defense and deputy chief of staff of the Army in 1974. It is not clear if he was deputy chief of staff in 1972, the date of the document. According to biographical material Mr. Pike has collected, General Quang had been a member of North Vietnam's central military party committee since 1961.  Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican and the ranking member of a Senate committee on prisoners' issues, said, ""It's an authentic document. There's no question about that.""  Mr. Smith's views reflected the sentiments expressed at a news conference on Capitol Hill by some veterans' organizations and advocates for the families of missing servicemen, who accepted the document as evidence of Vietnamese perfidy.  Asked why he believed the document was authentic, Mr. Smith cited a passage in the English translation that said Hanoi would soon ""free several prisoners of war from here, in order to put pressure on the Nixon Government, to see its reaction and the reaction of American society, but also for the purpose of demonstrating our good intentions in this matter.""  The document was supposedly written on Sept. 15, 1972. On Sept. 25 Hanoi released three pilots -- Maj. Edward K. Elias of the Air Force and Lieuts. (j.g.) Norris A. Charles and Markham L. Gartley of the Navy.  ""So in other words,"" Mr. Smith said, ""this commitment was made and followed through.""   LOAD-DATE: April 14, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 14 1993 ,11
"   , Thailand, April 13   Vietnam's senior diplomat dealing with United States affairs today described as a ""clear fabrication"" a document suggesting that 1,205 American prisoners of war were in North Vietnamese prisons in 1972, more than double the number eventually released.  The diplomat, Nguyen Xuan Phong, acting director of the Americas Department at the Foreign Ministry, said in a telephone interview from Hanoi that ""we have very strong evidence"" to prove ""this document is not authentic -- a clear fabrication.""  The document, recently discovered in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow, has alarmed former officials in Washington and scholars of the Vietnam War, who say it may prove that hundreds of prisoners were never released, and are now almost certainly dead.  Tracing the General  The document is a Russian translation of what is described as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by Gen. Tran Van Quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the North Vietnamese Army. It describes Hanoi's efforts to keep secret the number of American prisoners.  The report says that in 1972, even as Vietnam was claiming that it held only 368 American prisoners, there were 1,205 Americans in North Vietnamese prisons.  Mr. Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document was a fabrication was to review General Quang's career. In 1972, he said, General Quang was not deputy chief of staff; he was the Army commander in Military Region 4, in central Vietnam, a post he held from 1966 to 1974.  ""Gen. Tran Van Quang had nothing to do with the general staff of the Vietnamese People's Army,"" Mr. Phong said. ""There would be no reason for Gen. Tran Van Quang to have prepared this sort of report.""  A member of Mr. Phong's staff, Nguyen Ba Hung, said General Quang had never held been deputy chief of staff of the Army. ""That's why it sounded very funny when we heard this report,"" he said. ""Those who have knowledge about the war and about the Army would have a better understanding.""  Diplomatically Awkward  General Quang, now retired, is the director of an organization of Vietnamese veterans. Foreign Ministry officials said that, while they had not spoken to General Quang about the document, his staff had said the document was a forgery.  The document's release comes at a delicate time: Vietnamese officials are preparing for meetings in Hanoi next week with John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general who has been dispatched by President Clinton to discuss the issue of missing servicemen.  When the general's visit was announced this month, the Vietnamese took it as a sign that President Clinton might be prepared to move quickly to relax the 18-year-old United States embargo on trade and loans to Vietnam. Vietnam, one of the world's poorest nations, has abandoned Marxist economics and is eager for foreign investment -- specifically American -- in its newly free markets.  But Hanoi's optimism about the outcome of next week's meetings appears to have faded with the release of the document from the Soviet archives.  An Agenda Changes  Now, it appears, General Vessey's trip will focus largely on the authenticity of the document, and thus on the possibility that hundreds of prisoners were alive at the end of the war but were never freed.  The State Department said Monday that General Vessey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has served since 1987 as a Presidential envoy on the issue of missing Americans, will make the document his ""first order of business"" in Hanoi.  ""Obviously this document is not favorable for the course of relations between the two countries,"" Mr. Phong said. ""It will raise suspicions from the American people. But I don't think the document is able to reverse the belief that Vietnam has cooperated very well in this humanitarian issue over the fate of the missing Americans.""  Under the 1973 peace settlement between the United States and North Vietnam, 591 American prisoners of war were released from North Vietnam. When the last were freed, in April 1973, Hanoi said no more prisoners were left -- an assertion it has maintained ever since.  Mr. Phong said he was optimistic that United States officials would see the document as a fabrication, and that it should not delay efforts to normalize diplomatic and trade relations.  ""I have worked with United States Government representatives for seven years,"" he said. ""I believe that they are careful to distinguish the truth from the fabrications. I hope the American people can distinguish that, too.""   LOAD-DATE: April 14, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 14 1993 ,11
"    The long smoldering issue of unaccounted-for American prisoners from the Vietnam War has flared anew. Hanoi has only its long history of duplicity on the P.O.W. issue to blame for this latest ambushing of its hopes for more normal ties.  If the latest document to emerge from Soviet archives proves accurate, the process of normalization will have to be postponed yet again. No American interest in Vietnam ranks higher than keeping faith with the families of these missing servicemen.  In January, a Harvard researcher studying archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow came upon a document that purports to be a 1972 report from a senior North Vietnamese general. It declares that Hanoi actually held 1,205 American P.O.W.'s then, more than three times as many as the 368 it acknowledged.  A year later, following the Paris peace agreements, North Vietnam released 591 P.O.W.'s. Both Hanoi and the Nixon Administration declared that no Americans had been left behind. But there's always been room for doubt. The Pentagon still lists some 2,200 servicemen as formally unaccounted for, though it presumes that more than half of these actually died during the war.  It is possible that Hanoi held hundreds of additional undisclosed Americans -- even possible that, as Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former national security adviser, now hypothesizes, most of these were summarily executed sometime in the 1970's.  But there are sound reasons to investigate the new document carefully before jumping to such conclusions. Communist archives are notorious for disinformation and forgeries. Details about the names, background and treatment of some of those listed don't match other, authenticated information, although some of this could be the result of successive translations. And a careful Senate investigation last year narrowed the number of cases still in serious doubt to between 100 and 200. That makes 600 additional prisoners seem dubious.  Washington now must try to determine the accuracy of the new document. The purported author is alive and accessible in Hanoi, where he heads an official veterans group. As it happens, President Clinton's special envoy, retired Gen. John Vessey, was already planning to travel to Hanoi in the next few days to evaluate current Vietnamese cooperation on the P.O.W. issue.  Given Hanoi's past duplicity and concealment, its explanations can't be accepted unchallenged. But in recent months, Vietnam has shown a new cooperation toward American investigators, opening up archives whose very existence it had previously denied.  The Vietnam War saw cruelties committed by both sides. But America long ago subjected its behavior to public scrutiny, and has benefited from the results. Vietnam retains a closed political system whose rulers wrap their deeds in secrecy, inviting skepticism and ambush by chance documentary finds, accurate or not. Before normalization can proceed, Hanoi will have to provide a satisfactory explanation of the new document. Only when Hanoi opens up politically will outsiders be able to trust its word without demanding proof.

"      A United States envoy left today on a mission to Vietnam, but President Clinton instructed him that new questions about American prisoners of war must be resolved before there can be any thaw in relations with Hanoi.  The questions were raised by a 1972 report that suggests that Hanoi held more American prisoners than it has acknowledged. In turn, however, questions have also been raised about the document itself. The researcher who discovered it in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow has also come under criticism as a partisan who ardently opposes normalizing relations with Vietnam.  Some historians and researchers involved in the issue of American prisoners in Southeast Asia say the document contains inaccuracies that call its validity into question. Some call the document an outright fabrication, echoing terms that the Hanoi Government has used to describe it.  ""It's a clumsy fabrication,"" said H. Bruce Franklin, a professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University who has written a book in which he asserts that the Vietnamese do not still hold American prisoners of war. ""There is just about no fact in the document that correlates with the historical reality.""  'Fullest Possible Accounting'  The White House envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who served in Vietnam as a major in the field artillery, has been negotiating with Hanoi for information on the fate of the 2,260 Americans still listed as missing in action.  He will now check into the validity of the 1972 report, which suggests that Hanoi was holding 1,205 American prisoners in 1972, when it said it only held 368. The Vietnamese released 591 Americans as part of Operation Homecoming in early 1973, and since then they have consistently said they did not hold any more.  ""The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy toward Vietnam,"" George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said today.  Vietnamese officials are hoping that the U.S. will ease its trade embargo, or, more important, not try to block new loans from the International Monetary Fund.  The report, a Russian translation of a Vietnamese document, was unearthed by Stephen J. Morris, a fellow at Harvard University's Russian Research Center. Mr. Morris, an Australian who came to the United States to study in 1976, is not on the faculty but uses the center for research supported by grants.  His research in the Russian archives was sponsored by the Cold War History Project, at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. Officials of the project said Mr. Morris is to be paid for producing a report on his work.  Some Experts Believe Report  Several Soviet experts, including a former national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, have said they believe the report is genuine.  But skeptics, including Dr. Franklin, cite inaccuracies. For example, he and other experts cited a reference to the dispersal of American P.O.W.'s from 4 prisons to 11 after the abortive American raid on the Son Tay prison, 20 miles northwest of Hanoi, in September 1970. Each of the 11 prisons held about 100 prisoners, the report said. But the critics say that after the Son Tay raid, the Vietnamese consolidated -- rather than dispersed -- American prisoners to keep a closer eye on them.  In addition, Kenneth L. Coskey, executive director of the Naval Historical Foundation and a former inmate at the Hoa Lo Prison -- the infamous ""Hanoi Hilton"" -- said at least 350 prisoners were held there. Mr. Coskey did not offer an opinion on the document's authenticity.  ""The idea they had 100 in Hoa Lo is inaccurate,"" said a Congressional investigator who has worked on the M.I.A. issue and who insisted on anonymity.  Defining a Prison  Reached in Boston, Mr. Morris said the apparent discrepancy may relate to how the Vietnamese defined a prison. ""There may have been separate compounds in Hoa Lo,"" Mr. Morris said. ""I don't know how they're defining it. There might be subdivisons.""  The Vietnamese have said the main evidence to refute the document was that Gen. Tran Van Quang, the report's original author, was not Deputy to the North Vietnamese Army General Staff in 1972, as the Russian version indicates. But United States intelligence officials said today that he did hold that position.  One explanation offered by a former intelligence analyst to account for the large number of Americans listed by the Vietnamese as prisoners was that the Vietnamese may have included several hundred captured Asian civilians who were working for the Americans.  Sedgewick Tourison, who worked as an investigator for the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, said between 350 and 500 Asians, mainly Vietnamese, who were used on intelligence-gathering and sabatoge missions in North Vietnam between 1960 and 1968, had been captured.  Mr. Tourison and another former Congressional investigator say the commandos were often referred to in terms that could confuse their identity. ""The commandos were referred to by Radio Hanoi in domestic broadcasts during the war as American spy commandos or American spy saboteurs,"" Mr. Tourison said.  But Mr. Morris said it was ""preposterous"" to think that the Russian translation of the document might have misidentified American prisoners.  ""Anybody who has read Communist documents knows that they don't refer to South Vietnamese as American forces,"" he said. ""They always call them puppet forces. Anyone who says that is just not familiar with Communist documents.""   LOAD-DATE: April 16, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 16 1993 ,11
"    Particularly for those American business executives who hope the 18-year estrangement between the United States and Vietnam is coming to end, the report could not have come at a worse moment: four days before a special United States envoy was to travel to Hanoi to ascertain whether the Vietnamese were cooperating in the search for missing Americans, a stunning document surfaced suggesting that Hanoi has misled the United States about the number of prisoners it has held.  The report, dug up in Moscow by Stephen J. Morris, a Harvard-based researcher who opposes rapprochement with the communist regime in Vietnam, states that in September 1972, Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners. If accurate, the figure is twice the 591 American P.O.W.s that North Vietnam released in 1973. It would also suggest that Hanoi either killed the rest or, as some claim, is still holding them.  While some experts have said the document -- a Russian-language translation of a Vietnamese report -- is authentic, others have sought to debunk some of its assertions.  But the report has been accepted as gospel by the group of hard-line advocates of the notion that Hanoi has not been forthcoming about the fate of the 2,260 Americans still listed as missing. It has also opened old divisons surrounding the only war the United States has ever lost and created another headache for President Clinton, who, the M.I.A. advocates like to point out, avoided military service during the war.

"      A document recently unearthed in Moscow has breathed new life into one of this city's most enduring conspiracy theories: that the Reagan and Bush Administrations covered up attempts by Vietnam to trade American prisoners of war for cash.  The theory, which remains unproved, holds that Vietnam held back hundreds of P.O.W.s to make sure Washington paid war reparations, and then kept them as bargaining chips when no aid was forthcoming.  Proponents of this view see two new pieces of supporting evidence in the Sept. 15, 1972, document, whose authenticity is still in dispute. In it, a high-ranking Vietnamese military officer, identified as Gen. Tran Van Quang, wrote that Hanoi was holding 1,205 American prisoners, 837 more than it publicly acknowledged.  The officer explicitly linked the captives' release to economic aid and other concessions from the United States, saying, ""Nixon must compensate North Vietnam for those enormous losses which the destructive war caused."" Hanoi denies the authenticity of the document.  Only 591 Released  Eleven days later, at the Paris peace talks, Le Duc Tho, the Vietnamese negotiator, told American negotiators that the issue of prisoners was tied to ""the question of reparations,"" according to transcripts since made public.  When the war ended, Hanoi released only 591 prisoners. That was 400 to 600 fewer than American military officials had estimated were still alive. Eugene Tighe, a retired lieutenant general who once headed the Defense Intelligence Agency, said in an interview this week that he had helped draw up a list of 900 to 1,000 names of men presumed to be prisoners in 1973.  Relatively little was done to resolve this discrepancy in the Nixon, Ford and Carter Administrations. A Senate report released in January said that from 1975 to 1983, intelligence agencies had assigned a very low priority to collecting data on troops missing in action.  Congress repeatedly refused to authorize any money for rebuilding Vietnam and by the 1980's rumors were circulating in Washington and Asia that Vietnam was seeking discreetly to trade live P.O.W.'s for cash.  No Conclusive Proof Found  Those reports were repeatedly denied by officials in both the Reagan and Bush Administrations, and a recent inquiry by a Senate select committee failed to find conclusive proof either of such offers or a conspiracy to conceal them.  But the suspicions of Government wrongdoing persist, fueled by a stream of first-hand accounts from refugees and others that Americans are imprisoned in Southeast Asia. Those who believe the Vietnamese are holding Americans point to Vietnam's record in its war with France.  An expert formerly involved in investigations of Americans missing in Vietnam said that when the French withdrew in 1954, the Government agreed to pay an annual fee to Vietnam to maintain graves and continue resolution of casualties.  In 1986, rather than pay a yearly charge, France agreed to an unspecified lump sum, which was said by some to be about $360 million worth of grants and credits to buy French goods. Whatever the sum, Vietnam suddenly released 25,000 French remains in six months in 1986.  After that, some Vietnamese working on that program were transferred to American searches.  ""This is our country's greatest state secret,"" insisted J. Thomas Burch Jr., chairman of the National Vietnam Veterans Coalition. ""They've known these men were there and they've covered it up.""  Mr. Burch is a lawyer for the source of one of the most tantalizing stories, an account by a Secret Service agent of a 1981 conversation he says he overheard between President Reagan and his senior aides. According to the agent, the Government of Vietnam was offering to sell live P.O.W.s for $4.5 billion.  Senator Robert C. Smith, the New Hampshire Republican who was vice chairman of the Senate select committee, said in an interview that he learned of the agent's story in the mid-1980's. Mr. Smith, a member of the House of Representatives at the time, demanded a meeting with President Reagan and Vice President Bush and confronted them with the allegation in the Oval Office. Both denied it.  In 1992, when the Senate committee was investigating the matter further, the Secret Service agent refused to testify unless he was subpoenaed, saying he feared losing his job. The Treasury Department said Congressional testimony by a Secret Service agent would set a bad precedent, and a majority of the committee agreed.  When Richard Allen, Mr. Reagan's national security adviser at the time of the supposed offer, was questioned by the committee in 1992, he initially recalled an offer of $4 billion. Later, he said he had been mistaken, and that his recollection was of being asked about the issue years later. In an interview, Mr. Allen said that if the question had arisen during his tenure, he would have supported looking into it further.  Senator Smith said that Max Hugel, who was head of operations for the Central Intelligence Agency at the time, told him recently that the offer was well known to senior intelligence officials, and that the P.O.W.'s were to come out through Laos on Jan. 26, 1981. During his deposition to the committee, however, Mr. Hugel denied any knowledge of the issue or of having said anything about it to the Senator.  Senator Smith himself says he no longer believes the story told by the Secret Service agent. ""If I sit in the Oval Office and ask a straightforward question -- and they tell me the answer is ""No"" -- and then we have a guy that won't come forward, where does that leave you?"" he asked. ""I'm siding with the President.""  Proponents of the conspiracy theory suggest that the Reagan Administration was ignoring reports about the P.O.W.'s because it was afraid of being trapped into the sort of hostage crisis that crippled the Carter Presidency.  The Reagan Administration's actions cast doubt on that hypothesis. In early 1981, when it received intelligence reports on a possible prison camp in Laos, the Administration sent Laotian operatives into the jungle to search for confirmation. The search proved inconclusive; the team was permitted to look into the compound's buildings only from a distance.  Another opportunity arose in 1984, when a person with contacts in Southeast Asia, identified in the Senate report as I. Irving Davidson, was told by a general in Indonesia that the Vietnamese were willing to discuss with Washington the sale of both remains and live P.O.W.s. In this instance, a Government paper trail exists. Paul Wolfowitz, at the time a senior State Department official, wrote a memo to Secretary of State George P. Shultz that referred to the offer of ""possible live P.O.W.s.""  Richard Childress, the National Security Council's senior expert on Asia, traveled to Hanoi, met with a member of the Politburo and was told that the only thing the Vietnamese were ready to discuss was the return of remains.  The committee sent investigators to Indonesia to try to trace the report further, and even that led to conflicting testimony. The general said his original offer mentioned only remains; the general's brother, who was also involved, said the Vietnamese had included live P.O.W.s.  A final incident that has fueled speculation in Washington surrounds a February 1977 C.I.A. report. In it, Senator Smith said an Indonesian diplomat quoted the Vietnamese Vice Foreign Minister, Min Phan Hien, as saying that his country was holding P.O.W.s who would be released only if the United States provided aid.  A declassified version of the document, which does not identify the name of the Vietnamese official who is speaking, says that data on M.I.A.s were ""a trump card"" for Vietnam in coming talks with the United States.  William Hendon, a former Republican Congressman from North Carolina who is one of the most vocal advocates of the conspiracy theory, said he saw the complete version of the document while working for the Pentagon in 1983 as a consultant on P.O.W. issues. Although the document does not specifically identify a source, Mr. Hendon said he believed the Indonesian diplomat's account of the conversation had been picked up by a listening device secretly planted in Indonesia by the C.I.A.  A C.I.A. spokesman said Friday the agency now views the report as a ""fabrication.""  In 1986, a Pentagon panel headed by General Tighe reviewed the existing intelligence files and concluded that there was a ""strong possibility"" that Americans were still being held in Vietnam.  According to Mr. Hendon, William J. Casey, Director of Central Intelligence at the time, told several members of Congress in October 1986 that he had the same opinion, but could not take any action unless the Americans were seen by ""two of my men."" Mr. Hendon later prepared a sworn affidavit that quoted Mr. Casey as telling the group, ""What do you want, another hostage crisis?"" Mr. Casey died in 1987.  In its 585-page report, in January, the Senate Committee quoted sworn testimony from most of the major figures in American policy that a conspiracy of silence would have been impossible to carry out. Several noted that such an effort would require the support of thousands of people scattered through the military and intelligence agencies for a period of 20 years.  ""The isolated bits of information out of which some have constructed whole labyrinths of intrigue and deception have not withostood the tests of objective investigation,"" the report said. ""The vast archives of secret U.S. documents that some felt contained incriminating evidence have been thoroughly examined by the committee only to find that the conspiracy cupboard is bare.""                               --------------------   U.S. ENVOY DUE IN HANOI  HANOI, Vietnam, April 17 (AP) -- Gen.

"   , Vietnam, April 18   Vietnam provided American investigators with documents today that it says prove the fraudulence of a report found in Russia which suggests that hundreds of American prisoners of war were never freed.  John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general who is President Clinton's envoy to Vietnam, said it was too early to assess the Vietnamese documents. But at a meeting with Hanoi officials, he warned that the report, a Russian translation of a 1972 Vietnamese document, appeared to be authentic and had ""created very serious questions"" about the fate of missing Americans.  Hanoi said the documents presented to General Vessey today included a Defense Ministry census prepared in the early 1970's that showed 386 Americans had been captured by North Vietnam -- less than a third of the number indicated in the Russian translation of the September 1972 report by Gen. Tran Van Quang, listed as a Deputy Chief of Staff of the North Vietnamese Army. That report, discovered in January in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party by a Harvard University researcher, indicated that Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners.  That figure has alarmed United States officials and the families of Americans still listed as missing in action. Under the 1973 peace settlement with the United States, North Vietnam released only 591 American P.O.W.'s. Since then, Vietnam has insisted that no more remain alive in its custody, and that it has sent home the remains of dead Americans whenever they have been discovered.  'Based on Nothing'  Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister, Le Mai, told General Vessey that the Russian document was ""fabricated completely, based on nothing."" He suggested that it was the work of someone opposed ""to the process of normalization of relations between our two countries.""  Asked who was responsible for the fabrication, Mr. Le Mai said, ""It depends on your interpretation -- either the Americans or the Russians.""  Vietnamese officials are clearly alarmed at the possibility that the Russian document and the debate will lead the United States to retain an 18-year economic embargo on Vietnam.  The Clinton Administration, which last month signaled its willingness to improve relations with Hanoi, has said it will not lift the embargo until questions are answered about the fate of more than 2,000 Americans listed as missing from the Vietnam War.  Hanoi Searched for Evidence  Vietnamese officials said today that after news reports last week revealed the existence of the document in the Russian archives, the Vietnamese Defense Ministry searched its archives for evidence to refute it.  ""We wanted to find evidence to prove it was fabricated,"" said Ho Xuan Dich, the senior Foreign Ministry official handling the issue of missing Americans. In Vietnamese archives, he said, the Defense Ministry found the census from the early 1970's that listed all American prisoners captured from April 5, 1964, to February 18, 1972. There were, he said, only 386 names on the list, which was turned over to General Vessey today.  The Vietnamese have claimed for years that they have cooperated fully with the United States in the search for information about missing Americans.  Asked during a meeting with reporters why the census was being turned over only now, Mr. Dich gave two answers. First, he said that turning over the census had been unnecessary because all American prisoners had been released to the United States in 1973 and their names had been known to Washington for years. But he corrected himself a few minutes later, saying that the census had not been turned over earlier because ""we just found it this week.""  Five Other Documents  Vietnamese officials said five other documents presented to American investigators today included hospital and air defense reports prepared during the war that had recently been turned over to the Hanoi Government by provincial authorities.  It was not clear how those documents could be useful in proving the Russian report was a fabrication, and American and Vietnamese officials would not discuss their contents.  General Vessey, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has been a Presidential envoy to Vietnam since the Reagan Administration, is scheduled to meet with General Quang on Monday. General Quang, who is retired from the army and is now the leader of a veterans' group, has denied through Government spokesmen that he is the author of the 1972 report.  General Vessey told the Vietnamese today that he had consulted last week with a Russian historian, Gen. Dimitri Volkoganov, chairman of a Russian-American committee on prisoners of war, and that General Volkoganov had ""verified that this is an authentic Russian document.""  Members of General Vessey's 18-member party in Hanoi said that the question was not whether the translation was a genuine Russian document -- they believed that it is -- but whether the Russian translation was prepared by a competent translator, and whether it had been based on an authentic Vietnamese document.

"   , Vietnam, April 19   A Vietnamese general denied today that he had written in 1972 that Hanoi held more than twice as many American prisoners as it ultimately released. Any such report attributed to Hanoi is a forgery, he declared.  And a special envoy, sent by President Clinton to tell the Vietnamese that relations could not improve until the matter was cleared up, said he saw no reason to disbelieve the Vietnamese denial.  Nearly two weeks ago, Russian archivists turned over to the United States a Russian translation of what was said to be a secret report to Hanoi's Politburo given by Gen. Tran Van Quang, described in the document as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Vietnamese armed forces at the time. The document said Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners of war in September 1972.  591 Released in 1973  Because Vietnam released only 591 prisoners in 1973 and has maintained repeatedly that there were no other prisoners, the Russian translation raised the recurring question of whether Hanoi had kept some prisoners back, and if so, what happened to them. An alternative explanation offered by some experts was that Hanoi might have killed hundreds of prisoners.  Hanoi immediately denied the accuracy of the Russian document, saying it was a ""fabrication.""  In a meeting today, General Quang told President Clinton's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., that he did not write the 1972 report on which the Russian translation was supposedly based. If the Vietnamese report exists, General Quang said, it is a forgery that may have been prepared by someone interested ""in undermining advances in relations between Vietnam and the United States.""  At a news conference today after meeting with General Vessey, General Quang said of the 1972 report: ""I did not write it. I tell you, never in my life have I made such a report, because it was not in my area of responsibility.""  He stressed that although he was Deputy Chief of Staff on two occasions, he was not serving in that post in September 1972 as the document states.  General Vessey, after meeting with General Quang and other senior Vietnamese officials, said he had new doubts about the accuracy of the Russian translation.  The general, a retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at his own news conference in Hanoi: ""I don't think that one can draw conclusions about the document simply based on General Quang's statements, but I would say that what General Quang has told us is not inconsistent with what we know about General Quang. I have no reason to disbelieve General Quang.""  Asked whether he had new doubts about the accuracy of the document, General Vessey replied simply, ""Yes.""  [But the Harvard-based researcher who discovered the Russian document said in a telephone interview from Watertown, Mass., that he thought General Quang was lying.]  Given 'Important' Documents  General Vessey said Vietnamese officials provided him with ""important"" documents this week ""that may well shed light on the Russian document, at least they appear to, first blush.""  The general and American investigators in Hanoi do not question the authenticity of the Russian translation, saying they believe that it is a genuine Russian archival document. Instead, they question whether it was prepared by a competent Russian-Vietnamese translator, and whether the Vietnamese document on which it was based was authentic.  Vietnamese officials have said this week that they are concerned that the documents and the dispute over their authenticity will prevent the Clinton Administration from lifting an 18-year-old economic embargo on Vietnam and will further delay billions of dollars in development loans for Hanoi from the World Bank and other international lending agencies.  Issue Linked to Relations  Mr. Clinton, who is expected to meet with General Vessey when the general returns to Washington on Wednesday, has said he will not move to normalize diplomatic and economic ties with Vietnam until he is convinced that Hanoi is cooperating fully in determining the fate of more than 600 missing Americans.  In a joint statement, General Vessey and Hanoi officials said the Vietnamese documents turned over to American investigators include ""archives listing American prisoners of war held during the war, as well as American servicemen who died in captivity in southern and central Vietnam.""  On Sunday, the Vietnamese said they had given General Vessey an official Vietnamese Defense Ministry census prepared in the early 1970's stating that only 386 American prisoners had been captured by North Vietnam between April 1964 and February 1972.  American officials traveling with General Vessey said it might never be possible to prove or disprove the accuracy of the Russian translation and the authenticity of the 1972 Vietnamese report. But they said they were struck by discrepancies between information in the Russian translation and what is known about General Quang and his military career.  The Russian archives did not include a copy of the original Vietnamese document on which the translation was supposedly based, but the Russian translation lists General Quang as the Deputy Chief of Staff in September 1972.  According to official biographies published in Vietnam last year, before the Russian document became public, General Quang served in 1972 as a regional military commander in provinces in central Vietnam. He did serve as Deputy Chief of Staff twice, from 1959 to 1960 and from 1974 to 1978, but not in 1972.  ""I was not in Hanoi at that time,"" said General Quang, who is now the director of a Vietnamese veterans' association. ""I was never in charge of American prisoners of war. It's that simple and plain.""  Asked who might have been responsible for fabricating the document, he replied, ""You can ask the Russian intelligence services.""  Researcher Attacked  At the news conference with General Vessey, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam attacked the Harvard-based researcher, Stephen J. Morris, who found the Russian document during a search of the Communist Party archives in January.  ""I would like to say something about Stephen Morris, the person who publicized this,"" Mr. Cam said. ""He has a long history of opposing Vietnam, since the time he was an Australian student."" Mr. Morris, he said, had taken part in ""anti- Vietnam groups"" in the United States.  The Foreign Minister said he believed that Mr. Morris, a researcher for the Harvard Center for International Affairs who is now working on a book about the Vietnam War, ""had certain intentions when he chose the timing"" of releasing the Russian document. The translation became public in the United States only days after news reports suggested that Mr. Clinton was prepared to move quickly to improve ties with Vietnam.                               --------------------   A Liar, Researcher Says  WASHINGTON, April 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- Mr. Morris, the researcher who discovered the Russian document, challenged General Quang's truthfulness as well as the Vietnamese Foreign Minister's comments.  ""I think he's lying,"" he said of General Quang in a telephone interview from Watertown, Mass. ""I think there's a Vietnamese copy in Moscow in the files of the G.R.U. I've got the only Russian-language copy, which is copy No. 6, which means there are five other copies floating around somewhere, and the original.""  Told of Foreign Minister Cam's comments about him, Mr. Morris, an Australian, said: ""I have a history of opposing the Communist Party of Vietnam, but not the people of Vietnam. I've always believed that South Vietnam would be better off under a non-Communist government.""  He added that he does not oppose normalization of relations with Hanoi but believes that it should occur after a full accounting of missing Americans and after Vietnam stops what he called its interference in Cambodian affairs.

"      A special Presidential envoy to Vietnam presented President Clinton today with evidence that he said undermined a recently found Russian document suggesting that Hanoi lied to Washington about the number of American prisoners it held in 1972.  Even as the envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., raised his questions, Clinton Administration officials said there had been no decision on moving toward recognition of the Hanoi Government or easing the 18-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam. ""No decisions have been made by the President in terms of what are the next steps to be made, and no recommendations have been made to him,"" said a senior Administration official who insisted on anonymity.  At a news conference at the Pentagon, Mr. Vessey, a retired Army general, also said Hanoi appeared to be cooperating with United States authorities to determine the fates of the 2,260 American service members and civilians who have yet to be accounted for nearly 18 years after the last American troops left Vietnam.  Signs of Cooperation  ""The Vietnamese are at least bending over backward to appear to be cooperative,"" said Mr. Vessey, who returned on Tuesday from a trip to Hanoi. ""Now, in the long run, only the facts will show whether or not that cooperation is real.""  Cooperation on helping to resolve what happened to the missing Americans, about half of whom have been listed by United States authorities as having died in the war, is a major factor in the decision on the trade embargo.  Clinton Administration officials said even if the evidence brought back by Mr. Vessey completely refuted the Russian document, the Administration would still have to evaluate Vietnam's continued help in finding and identifying remains of service members, gaining access to additional archives in Hanoi and securing the cooperation of Laos in accounting for missing Americans there.  The dispute over the fate of P.O.W.'s in Vietnam arose over a document that a Harvard University researcher said he had found in Russian archives. The document, supposedly written by Lieut. Gen. Tran Van Quang, whom it describes as deputy chief of the North Vietnamese general staff, states that in September 1972 Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners, a figure far higher than the number of Americans Hanoi has ever acknowledged holding.  In February 1973, North Vietnam released 591 American prisoners and has contended ever since that it held no more. Mr. Quang has denied writing the document, and the Vietnamese have called it a fake.  At his news conference, Mr. Vessey produced a photocopy of a Vietnamese ledger known as the ""blue book"" that names 381 American aviators listed in chronological order of their captures, beginning with Everett Alvarez, the first, who was captured in August 1964, and ending in February 1972.  Of those listed by Hanoi, Mr. Vessey said, he had been told that 14 had died in captivity and that Hanoi released 8 in 1968 and 1969, leaving a total of 359 in captivity. He added that between February and September 1972 an additional 108 American aviators were shot down by North Vietnam, of whom 63 were captured and later released.  Using that arithmetic 422 American aviators were held by Hanoi in September 1972. According to the Russian document, found by Stephen J. Morris, an Australian who has been a strong critic of the Vietnamese Communists, 624 American aviators were prisoners then. Mr. Vessey discounted the possibility that the Vietnamese had another set of books and had imprisoned Americans in a second, secret prison system.

"      The Russian chairman of a joint United States-Russian commission on American P.O.W.'s said today that he was convinced that a report that counted 1,205 American prisoners of war in Vietnam in 1972 was a genuine document from the archives of the Soviet Communist Party.  But he added that he could not vouch for the veracity of the information in the report.  The chairman, Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, who is also a historian, said he learned of the document this month, several months after Stephen J. Morris had obtained it. Identified as a report to the Communist Party Politburo in Hanoi on Sept. 15, 1972 by a North Vietnamese general, the document has raised questions about Hanoi's sincerity on the P.O.W. issue and threatened to impede any rapid improvement in United States-Vietnamese relations.  ""My opinion is that the document is completely authentic,"" said General Volkogonov, who returned here on Tuesday after a trip to the United States. ""Whether the information is accurate I cannot say.""  According to General Volkogonov, the director of the archives center where the document had been held was dismissed on Tuesday for allowing it to fall into the hands of an independent researcher before it had been made known to the P.O.W. commission. A spokesman for the Russian State Archives confirmed that the director of the Center of Contemporary Archives, Rem A. Usikov, had been dismissed for violating rules that govern access to top secret archives.  LOAD-DATE: April 22, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 22 1993 ,11
"    UNCLE HO never stops smiling as the bicycles whiz past him hour after hour in the middle of the busiest intersection in Hanoi. The bikes converge there beneath a giant billboard that shows a youthful, grinning Ho Chi Minh -- Uncle Ho, or Bach Ho, as he is still affectionately known in north Vietnam -- with a young child held tight in his thin arms.  The Vietnamese bicyclists rarely look up at the billboard, but that is no sign of disrespect for the founder of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. It is a matter of simple survival.  The intersection of Trang Tien and Hoang Streets is a ceaseless blur of rubber and chrome -- there are relatively few private cars in the Vietnamese capital, so it is mostly bicycle and motorbike traffic -- and to lift your eyes from the road at this midtown crossing is to risk catastrophe.  The bicyclists pay no attention to a white-gloved, olive-uniformed traffic cop who stands on a small metal platform in the middle of the intersection. His directions, given with precise blasts of a whistle clenched between his front teeth, are ignored.  I tried to gaze up at Ho as I maneuvered my handsome new Vietnamese two-wheeler beneath the billboard and nearly collided with a farmer on the wrong side of the road, carting his potatoes to market.  Miraculously, I did not see a single serious bike collision during a week spent peddling my way through the streets of Hanoi and, apart from that one chaotic intersection, the traffic was remarkably civil.  The North Vietnamese are a determined, practical people -- they tend to win their wars, as they will diplomatically remind you -- and a bicycle is much too valuable a piece of property to allow to be damaged in a foolish accident.  ""We are very, very careful if we see a foreigner on a bike,"" said Mr. Van, the young English-language student from Hanoi University who would prove himself an invaluable companion on my first bicycling tour of the city. ""It would be very bad if we ran over an American,"" he said in the deadly serious tone typical of Northerners, who are also an earnest bunch. ""It would be bad for foreign policy."" (While the Vietnamese are not prohibited from having contact with foreigners, it can bring them under suspicion from the police, and for that reason I use only one of Mr. Van's three names.)  From a distance Hanoi seems to many foreign travelers a gray, hostile, even frightening place. Certainly for many Americans, the city is inseparable from the ugly headlines of the Vietnam War.  I've met several Americans who, planning a trip to Hanoi, gird themselves for what they assume will be a Southeast Asian Dresden, a bombed-out shell of a city. In fact, the city survived the war largely intact. It is arguably the most beautiful capital in Southeast Asia, a city of quiet, dignified, dilapidated charm borne of 1,000 years of history and struggle. The streets are lined with the architectural legacy of the French colonizers of Vietnam: crumbling but still elegant 19th-century ocher-colored villas and storefronts.  Despite still-primitive tourist facilities, Hanoi is also among the friendliest, most inviting capitals of Asia. The Vietnamese are unfailingly polite to travelers, especially to Americans, whose help they want to revive an economy that is only now beginning to recover from that long-ago war.  That Hanoi retains so much such Old Asian charm is a mixed blessing for the Vietnamese. The colonial-era architecture and greenery have survived not so much because of far-sighted urban planners; they reflect rather Vietnam's long economic stagnation.  After decades of war and disastrous Soviet-style central planning, Vietnam is one of the world's poorest countries, and progress -- as measured in much of the rest of Asia by skyscrapers and shopping malls and dirty air -- has yet to arrive for the three million people of Hanoi.  The question for the Vietnamese is how long Hanoi will remain this impoverished, and also this tranquil. The Vietnamese would never admit it, but they have been inspired by the recent economic model offered by their great rivals, the Chinese. In 1986 the Hanoi Government announced a Chinese-style policy of renovation -- doi moi, in Vietnamese -- intended to introduce a free market to Vietnam without dislodging the authoritarian government.  IT seems to be working. The Vietnamese economy is growing quickly, even with an American trade embargo in place, and visiting foreign investors and economists say it is only a matter of time before Hanoi begins to resemble its overdeveloped sister cities elsewhere in Southeast Asia.  Already the old South Vietnamese capital of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, has taken on the appearance of a Bangkok suburb, complete with trendy restaurants and traffic congestion.  Hanoi may be the last major city of Southeast Asia best toured by bicycle -- a gentle breeze rustling through the tamarind and milkwood trees that line the narrow streets, the only other sound that of the tinkling of the handlebar bells on bicycles.  A bicycle tour of Hanoi begins with the search for a bike. The advice I had been given by Vietnamese friends -- and I'm glad I listened to it -- was to buy a new bicycle at the central government emporium on Trang Tien Street, across from the billboard of Uncle Ho. A new bicycle in Vietnam costs a small fraction of what it would in the West, $25 to $45. That guarantees you new wheels and new brakes, no small considerations. And while Vietnamese bicycles are not especially sturdy, they will doubtless survive several days on the capital's pancake-flat streets. Among the rows and rows of bicycles, I was immediately drawn to a sleek model with the brand name of Hanel. It had a price tag of 400,000 Vietnamese dong, or about $40.  It really was handsome, forest green with blue trim, and several wide-eyed children watched enviously as the saleslady pumped up the tires, dusted off the handlebars and raised the seat to accommodate a six-foot American. In her broken English, she thanked me, offering the most memorable line of my trip to Vietnam -- ""Happy bike, mister America"" -- as I waltzed my two-wheeled treasure to the street.  On my first day of touring, I chose a route that would take me from my hotel, the newly restored colonial-era Pullman Metropole on Ly Thai To Street, past some of the city's most memorable sites and picturesque neighborhoods, and on to its most important landmark, the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.  I set off alone but I was quickly joined by a friendly Vietnamese student in his early 20's, Mr. Van, who wanted to test his English, the foreign language that many Vietnamese consider their ticket to prosperity. I welcomed the company.  ""Where are you from? Are you from America?"" Mr. Van asked as his bicycle pulled alongside mine. ""I would be honored to speak English with you."" I readily agreed, so long as he would be my tour guide.  We first turned left down Trang Tien Street, in the heart of Hanoi's commercial district, toward the splendid Opera House, built in 1911 by the French as a replica of the Paris Opera. It is now used as a government meeting hall.  Little did the French know that three decades after its construction Vietnamese nationalists would rush to the balcony of the gingerbread Opera House and declare independence from their occupiers.  Most of the city's largest shops and galleries are found at the other end of Trang Tien Street. Mr. Van and I parked outside the Foreign Language Bookshop at 61 Trang Tien Street. Only a year and a half earlier, on my first visit to Hanoi, the shop had been stacked high with Russian-language books. Now, the Russian books had been relegated to a dusty corner, replaced by stacks of English-language texts and the Vietnamese translations of popular modern American novels.  At the end of the block, Mr. Van and I turned right onto the busy thoroughfare that is Hoang Street, which runs along the tree-shaded Hoan Kiem Lake, or the Lake of the Restored Sword. The lake is the heart of the city.  Legend has it, and some variation of the legend is known by all Vietnamese schoolchildren, that this is the home of the magic tortoise that provided the Vietnamese hero Le Loi with a sword he used to liberate Vietnam from the Chinese in the 15th century.  The lake is at its most enchanting in the early evening, when lovers sit beneath delicate willows on its grassy banks. The tiny Tortoise Pagoda in the middle of the lake is the city's emblem.  A few blocks along Hoang Street, past the central post office, the road branches in several directions, all of them leading into the Old Quarter. A tricky place for a bicycle because of the narrow, rutted streets, the Old Quarter is the best place to glimpse colonial-era Hanoi.  We turned left down Hang Bong Street, full of Parisian-style row houses and tiny shops, the most interesting of which were the pharmacies selling traditional medicines.  As Mr. Van explained it to me, the dark-brown juice made from pulverized geckos, the small lizards found throughout the tropics, is thought to be a magic elixir for impotence and respiratory ailments. ""You do not think about the taste,"" he said.  AT 53 Hang Bong is the The Duc The Thao Shop, where a family makes many of the gold-and-red cloth banners that are strung between street lamps during Communist Party celebrations. They take custom orders, as well, and for very little money they will sew together a grand banner that meets the requirements of a foreign tourist. I had one eight-foot-long banner made to welcome the birth of a niece in Northern California: Vietnam Welcomes Birth of Glorious Child! The price was about $5, and it took only a day to make.  We headed a few blocks south, turning right on Hai Ba Trung Street, where we encountered the grim Hoa Lo Prison. It is perhaps the only structure in Hanoi that large numbers of Americans know, if only by the nickname given it by American prisoners of war: the Hanoi Hilton. Many Americans were imprisoned, and tortured, at Hoa Lo during the Vietnam war.  The prison, which for obvious reasons is not included in tours organized by the government tourist agency, was built in the earlier part of the century by the French and is still used as a prison.  There are only a few windows in the blocklong building, and they are covered by rusting metal grills. Across the top of the 20-foot walls are both electrified barbed wire and shards of glass.  As I reached for my camera, Mr. Van whispered anxiously, ""No pictures, no pictures."" There was indeed an unsmiling, armed soldier watching my every move from across the street. The prison may soon be no more. The land is now so valuable that Singaporean developers are planning to pull it down to make way for an office complex.  We pedaled on toward Dienbienphu Street, named in honor of the momentous 1954 battle that ended a century of French rule.  Dienbienphu Street is a fitting address for the Army Museum celebrating Vietnam's military victories over the French, the Americans and, most recently, the Chinese, who were driven out of northern border areas of Vietnam after a 1979 invasion.  The museum was in the headlines in the United States last year after the announcement that Vietnam had turned over thousands of artifacts, including photographs, from the museum archives that could be useful in determining the fate of more than 2,000 American troops still missing from the war.  When Mr. Van and I stopped at the museum, a team of American investigators from the Defense Department could be seen on the patio on the second floor, photographing artifacts including pilot helmets and flight suits.  Many Americans, especially veterans, find the museum jarring, especially with its unsubtle outdoor display of a Soviet-built MIG-21 jet fighter perched over the charred debris of a downed American B-52 bomber. Across from the museum is Chi Long Park, which serves as a stark reminder that, while the economy of Vietnam is undergoing something of a revolution, the political system is not. Vietnam is one of the last of the satellites of the former Soviet Union to hold on tight to the trappings of Communism, and Chi Long Park is dedicated to the memory of Lenin. There is an enormous, heroic statue of the Russian leader set in well-tended gardens.  I was eager to go down the road toward the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, but pulled over to the sidewalk when I heard a distinctive hiss. I turned to look. My rear tire was flat -- my brand-new rear tire.  ""Your bike, no problem,"" Mr. Van said, pointing a block away to a group of young men sitting on the street corner with bicycle pumps and small plastic buckets. Bicycle mechanics are found on most large street corners in Hanoi.  A small bidding war erupted among the mechanics for the chance to fix my tire. The winner was a smiling fellow who had bid 10,000 dong, or about $1.  As he worked away I watched the stream of bikes down Dienbienphu Street, wide and lined with shade trees.  The women bicyclists are an enchanting sight not only for their grace, but for their determined efforts to prevent their skin from having a moment's contact with the sun. It is serious business, for fair skin is much prized among Vietnamese women, who consider a tan evidence of field work. Many pull their bikes off the road every few blocks to readjust their conical bamboo hats.  My bike repaired, we set off on the final few blocks to the resting place of Ho Chi Minh, the imposing, gray-marble mausoleum set in the center of a complex of museums and other monuments.  WHATEVER his eventual place in history, Ho Chi Minh will be remembered as the Vietnamese leader who faced down two Western nations -- the United States and France -- in a dream of uniting his country. He never married and lived a modest life in a small house near the opulent colonial-era Presidential Palace, in which he refused to live.  His house, made of dark hardwood and supposedly preserved by Vietnamese curators just as Ho left it, is a short walk from the mausoleum and borders a pond in which he raised carp.  Mr. Van and I parked our bikes beneath banyan and frangipani trees outside the One Pillar Pagoda. The miniature pagoda was rebuilt in the mid- 1950's after the original, dating from the 11th century, was burned by vengeful French soldiers as they retreated.  Ho's mausoleum is, it would seem, exactly what he did not want. In his handwritten will, which is available in English translation at bookshops throughout Hanoi, Ho asked that his body be cremated, and the ashes divided between three sites, in north, south and central Vietnam. He asked that at each site there be a simple wooden memorial with plenty of shade for visitors.  Instead, after his death in 1969, Ho's successors in the Communist Party released a falsified version of his will and built him the hulking stone memorial. They did not cremate his body but instead put it on display, Lenin-like, under glass in a refrigerated chamber. (Once a year, Ho's embalmed corpse is shipped to Moscow for maintenance by the same technicians who tend to Lenin's body.)  Mr. Van stopped suddenly, remembering where he was. ""I hope you can forgive me,"" he said. ""I must leave because the police will watch you very carefully here,"" motioning to the many guard stations around the memorial, which is as heavily fortified as any place in the city. ""Maybe I will go home now.""  I thanked Mr. Van, and we parted with a promise that he would serve as my guide on my next visit to Hanoi. As I turned down Hung Vuong Street, I was met by one of the blank-faced honor guards who accompany all visitors in the final 100 yards or so toward the mausoleum.  The guard walked slowly alongside me until we reached the entrance, and he pointed me toward a long red carpet leading inside. Over the entrance was a sign bearing Ho's most famous slogan: ""Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom.""  Up a separate staircase within the structure, I found myself in a cavernous room bathed in a ghostly, pinkish light. At the center of the room, beneath a Vietnamese flag, was the glass sarcophagus bearing Ho's frail body. Ho's wispy white beard had been carefully groomed and set on a stiff gray shirt. His hands had a waxy sheen and were crossed over his chest.  In each corner of the room was a guard in a chocolate-colored uniform, apparently to insure that guests walk single file past the body and not linger. I stopped for a moment, and a guard approached me and nudged my elbow, indicating I should move on.  With the knowledge that Ho did not want to be remembered with this sort of bleak, even ghoulish monument, I found myself unmoved by the sight of his corpse.  The reaction of Vietnamese visitors was different, and I was met outside the mausoleum by several old men and women who appeared by their dark-colored, modest clothing to be from the countryside. They had just come from inside the mausoleum and all brushed tears from their eyes. Looking me up and down, they seemed perplexed that a visitor to the city of Ho Chi Minh could be so little affected by the sight of his earthly remains.

"    Vietnam has announced that foreign travelers will no longer need travel permits to visit most areas of the country, lifting a rule that for years had discouraged travelers from venturing much beyond Vietnam's two big cities.  The move, which went into effect this month, ends the need for travelers to go through the time-consuming and sometimes fruitless process of applying for a police travel permit whenever they wished to journey outside the capital, Hanoi, or the country's commercial center, Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  Despite the new rule, visitors, particularly unescorted individuals not traveling with a tour group, should still be ready for problems if they plan on going to very remote areas of the Vietnamese countryside, especially those rarely visited by foreigners.  In a country that is still mostly without telephones and other forms of modern communications, provincial bureaucrats continue to wield great authority, and they do not always take kindly to directives from the central Government. In recent months, business people and foreign reporters have been detained for hours at provincial checkpoints and have sometimes been turned back, even when they carried police travel permits.  Special permits are still required for foreigners wishing to visit border areas or near large military installations. Since few tourist maps identify military sites, it's a good idea to go over itineraries with a tourist office in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City.  The central office in Hanoi is at 30A Ly Thoung Kiet Street, telephone 64154 or 57532, and in Ho Chi Minh City at 69-71 Nguyen Hua Boulevard, 90772.

"   , Vietnam, May 5   Officials from Vietnam, Laos and the United States will hold talks in Hanoi this week in an effort to speed the hunt for Americans still missing from the Indochina war, American investigators said today.  The Hawaii-based task force investigating the fate of 2,260 Americans unaccounted for after the Vietnam War said the talks scheduled for Friday and Saturday were intended to improve coordination among the three nations and speed up their joint efforts.  It would be the third technical level talks between the three and the first to be held in Hanoi, said Ho Xuan Dich, head of Vietnam's investigating office. Earlier meetings were held in Vientiane, Laos, in 1990 and 1991.

"      Sev eral big United States companies Citibank, General Electric, Philip Morris and I.B.M. -- will soon receive licenses to open offices in Vietnam, Government officials said Friday.  Their applications are part of a growing wave of United States business interests in Vietnam despite a United States Government economic embargo.  The officials also confirmed a report in the Vietnam Investment Review, a business weekly, that the heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. had been granted a license to open an office in Hanoi.  Citibank would be the second United States bank authorized to open a representative office, after Bank of America. They join about 20 foreign banks represented in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon.  Vietnam, seeking to adapt its Communist economy to market principles, has welcomed United States businesses despite the embargo, which it hopes President Clinton will soon lift.  As a condition for dropping the sanctions, the United States has insisted on maximum Vietnamese cooperation in helping to close the files on missing United States servicemen from the Vietnam War.  Former President George Bush relaxed the embargo last year to allow United States companies to open offices, make contacts and sign contracts to go into effect if the ban was lifted. The embargo was imposed in 1964.  LOAD-DATE: May 24, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 23 1993 ,11
"      President Clinton's senior foreign policy advisers have concluded that the Administration should no longer attempt to block loans to Hanoi from the International Monetary Fund, senior Administration officials said tonight. The recommendation could presage an easing of the relationship between the United States and Vietnam.  In a meeting last week, members of the National Security Council decided to recommend to the President that the United States raise no objections to a plan by France and Japan to pay more than $140 million in arrears that Hanoi owes to the fund. Such an action would free the monetary fund to approve new lending to Vietnam during its next board meeting in July.  Officials said tonight that no decision has been made by the President as yet. In addition, it is unclear whether Mr. Clinton's advisers have reached a consensus on whether to recommend that the United States end its 18-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam.  Subsidizing Vietnam  Proponents of a rapprochement between the United States and Hanoi say that once the fund begins lending to Vietnam, it would be harder for the Administration to justify the continuation of a trade embargo. The extension of the fund's loans to Vietnam would mean that United States taxpayers would, in essence, be subsidizing Vietnam's economic development, but at the same time United States companies would be precluded from concluding contracts that are a part of that economic development.  Asked about the proposal, Secretary of State Warren Christopher would only say today that, ""It's under intensive review, and hopefully we will be having a decision on that in the near future.""  The Clinton Administration, citing Hanoi's increased cooperation in helping to determining the fate of 2,260 American servicemen who are unaccounted for from the war in Southeast Asia, had been strongly considering easing its opposition to new monetary fund loans to Vietnam when the lending agency met in April.  But, just prior to the meeting, a Harvard-based researcher, Stephen J. Morris, brought forward a document he discovered in the Russian archives alleging that Hanoi had many more Americans prisoners than it had acknowledged capturing.  Created a Sensation  Though a number of specialists on the war say the Morris document contained a number of inaccuracies, it created such a sensation in Washington that the Administration was forced to postpone any plans it might have had in moving to allow the lending program.  Meanwhile, a bipartisan group headed by former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie came out today in favor of ending the embargo.  Following a trip to Vietnam in April, a majority of the 10-member delegation concluded that interests would best be served by lifting the embargo, Mr. Muskie said in a statement.  Earlier today, officials in Hanoi announced that Vietnam would apply for observer status, and later for membership, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a world trade body.

"      The Clinton Administration is considering allowing American companies to bid on contracts in Vietnam that are financed by loans from international lending agencies like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, officials said today.  If accepted by the President, such an action, combined with an Administration decision not to block a plan that would give Hanoi access to loans from multilateral lending institutions, would be the most far-reaching easing of the 18-year-old United States trade embargo against its former wartime enemy.  An official familiar with the Administration's deliberations said the idea of allowing American companies to bid for projects financed by international lending institutions is considered a compromise between simply allowing Vietnam to access to loans and completely lifting the embargo.  Senior Administration officials say President Clinton will probably decide on the issue this week. One official stressed that he may not make any change in policy.  Representatives of business groups seeking trade with Vietnam say that permitting American companies to bid on development projects financed by international lending institutions would only allow a narrow range of American companies access to Vietnam's potential market. For example, American petroleum companies, seeking to exploit Vietnam's offshore oil fields would not be permitted to execute contracts with Hanoi. Nor would trading companies seeking to import rice or textiles from Vietnam.  Mr. Clinton has come under increasing pressure by groups on all sides of the question of whether the United States should ease tensions with Vietnam. All sides agree that the main issue is Hanoi's cooperation in determining the fate of 2,260 American servicemen who are listed as unaccounted for from the Southeast Asia wars.  Some veterans groups such as the American Legion, and their allies in Congress, argue that no improvement of relations between the United States and Vietnam should be undertaken.  ""We've urged him not to approve the loan by the I.M.F. because of the fact that Vietnam has not cooperated with respect to the P.O.W./M.I.A issue.,"" said John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion. ""They continue to dribble out a document or two relating to missing Americans when it suits their purpose or when they are seriously criticized for not cooperating.""  Others, such as Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who headed the Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, say some reciprocal action is needed to insure Hanoi's continued help in the search for unaccounted for Americans.  Maj. Gen. Thomas G. Needham, the Pentagon official in charge of the search for unaccounted for Americans, has told Administration officials and lawmakers that Hanoi's cooperation in the search ""is at its highest level.""  With Hanoi's help, 104 of the 196 American servicemen who were considered to have had the best chance of survival after being captured or shot down over Vietnam have officially been determined to have died, Department of Defense officials said. Investigators have also checked 66 cases of Americans whom defectors or other individuals have reported seeing alive in the years since the war. According to Mr. Kerry, no evidence has been discovered that the Americans were alive.  Hanoi has also produced new documents that have been demanded by American investigators and allowed interrogation of top military leaders.  Administration officials also say that pressure is building on them from allies such as Japan and France to at least not stand in the way of new lending by the monetary fund.  In April, the two countries asked the United States how it would view a plan to lend Vietnam $140 million to pay off debts incurred when Hanoi conquered the South and as a result assumed loans that had been granted to the old South Vietnamese Government. Once Hanoi becomes current in its loans to the monetary fund, it would be eligible for new World Bank and Asian Development Bank loans.

"    France and Japan want to lend Vietnam $140 million to pay off the old Saigon regime's debts to the International Monetary Fund. That would make Hanoi eligible for new international loans to help its market-oriented economic reforms.  It's a constructive idea. But it has been held up until now by stubborn opposition from Washington. Beyond a reasonable concern about missing servicemen, previous administrations have seemed determined to keep punishing Hanoi for winning the war almost 20 years ago. President Clinton can end this counterproductive sulk by following his advisers' recommendation to let Paris and Tokyo proceed.  The main argument against doing so comes from groups like the American Legion and diehard Republican senators. These insist that Vietnam still isn't cooperating in resolving the cases of Americans listed as prisoners of war or missing in action since the Vietnam War. Yet a bipartisan group of senators recently visited Hanoi and reported continuing progress. While 2,260 Americans remain formally listed as P.O.W.'s or M.I.A.'s, the number of active cases has now been reduced below 100.  Two years ago, the Bush Administration produced a ""road map,"" tracing out the steps it expected Hanoi to take to achieve fully normal relations with the United States. Washington indicated that it would begin to soften U.S. policies as Vietnam took the appropriate steps.  Yet despite undeniable progress on the Vietnamese side -- including, most recently, Hanoi's full cooperation with last month's elections sponsored by the United Nations in Cambodia -- Washington has barely budged. President Bush, a Vietnam hawk and the President who boasted of burying the ""specter of Vietnam"" in the sands of Kuwait, might have helped heal the wounds at home by taking the first significant steps before he left office.  Instead he left it to Mr. Clinton, whom some veterans groups still distrust for opposing, and avoiding service in, the Vietnam War. Even if he has to take some political heat for it, Mr. Clinton should do the right thing and end American opposition to the loans.

"      The Clinton Administration is planning to drop its opposition to loans to Vietnam by international lending institutions, Administration officials said today.  The move would be a way of acknowledging Vietnam's recent cooperation in accounting for Americans still missing in Southeast Asia and to encourage it to do more, the officials added.  White House officials said the final details of the new policy, which are still being hammered out, would probably be announced by President Clinton on Friday.  While dropping the lending ban falls short of ending the American economic embargo against Vietnam, the step is likely to help pave the way for an opening of trade with Hanoi in the near future.  It certainly would be the biggest easing of the trade embargo imposed by the United States on Vietnam since the country was unified under Communist rule in 1975.  President Clinton will meet at the White House on Thursday with a coalition of groups involved in the efforts to account for military personnel missing in Southeast Asia to explain his thinking, hear their views and enlist their support for the proposed move. These groups have given such proposals a mixed reaction.  Incentives to Cooperate  The President will argue that when obstacles to international lending to Vietnam are removed, Hanoi will have an even greater inducement to cooperate with Washington in accounting for missing personnel, with the understanding that further cooperation will probably lead to a lifting of the trade embargo.  The Administration is expected to tell Hanoi that it can move ahead now with international loans and that its cooperation will be reviewed when the Administration makes its annual reassessment of the trade embargo on Sept. 14.  ""The key word is progress and not just cooperation,"" said a senior Administration official. ""Cooperation is just merely helping us out. What the president is committed to is the fullest possible accounting. So lifting the embargo is tied to tangible results.""  To underscore the point, Mr. Clinton is expected to accompany announcement of his new policy on the lending ban with a decision to send a senior official, most likely Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, to Hanoi to press for further help on accounting for the missing.  Technically, what the Clinton Administration will be doing is lifting its opposition to a French-led proposal to refinance Vietnam's $140 million debt to the International Monetary Fund -- a move that will enable Hanoi to clear its arrears, restructure its debt and attract further international financing.  Because Hanoi was in arrears on its I.M.F. debt, it was not able to secure much larger loans from the World Bank and other international lending institutions to underwrite the sort of major infrastructure projects it needs to make its economy more competitive.  Administration officials said the draft announcement, which they cautioned was subject to change between now and Friday, was the unanimous recommendation of the inter-agency task force, headed by the National Security Council, that had been charged with shaping policy on this issue. It included representatives from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Treasury, the State Department and the Pentagon.  A Sensitive Issue  The emphasis that officials put on the unanimity of the recommendation underscores how politically sensitive this issue is for Mr. Clinton, who avoided the Vietnam war draft.  On this issue, Mr. Clinton finds himself caught between several pressures. From one side, business groups are eager to make certain that American companies will be able to get in on business opportunities in Vietnam.  Indeed, the changed policy on lending to Vietnam is bound to highlight the fact that American companies are still barred from trading with Hanoi and will not be able to bid on some of the huge infrastructure projects likely to be financed by international banks there in the coming years.  But from another direction, the President knows he is vulnerable to complaints from groups concerned about those still officially listed as missing in Vietnam. These groups accuse the Hanoi Government of failing to reveal everything it knows about those listed as missing.  At the same time, officials said, Mr. Clinton and his national security advisers felt that to maintain Vietnam's cooperation in the search for information on those listed as missing, they probably needed some symbolic way to acknowledge that Hanoi has been providing a fuller accounting in some missing-persons cases as well as better access by American investigators.  There are now roughly 90 so-called ""discrepancy cases"" in which there is information that a person listed as missing was at one time alive in captivity in Southeast Asia, but has still not been accounted for.  In the meantime, according to the Reuters news agency, one compromise idea being considered by the Administration would keep the embargo in place for now but let American companies carry out contracts financed by lenders like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.  Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, has been meeting with veterans' groups in recent weeks to sound them out on this change of policy. Veterans' groups, together with politically powerful organizations of relatives of those listed as missing, appear to be divided about ending the official opposition to the I.M.F. loan restructuring, though clearly there are more opponents than supporters.  ""We believe that if you do this, the United States would lose all leverage for negotiating with the Vietnamese,"" Dolores Alfond, head of the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, said in an open letter to Mr. Clinton this week.

"    To the Editor:  The American Legion takes exception to ""Stop Punishing Vietnam"" (editorial, June 27). We should stop punishing ourselves. The right thing to do in our relationship with Vietnam is to achieve the fullest possible accounting for Americans held prisoner of war and missing in action from the Vietnam War. Specifically, Hanoi must release Americans held prisoner, provide their remains or tell us why neither is possible. To accept anything less is to perpetuate the emotional agony Americans have endured for more than two decades.  We particularly disagree with your view of ""undeniable"" progress on the part of the Vietnamese. Vietnam's ""cooperation"" has been minimal and manipulative. According to Pentagon figures, 265 remains were released between 1974 and 1990; only 4 were released in 1991 and none through September 1992. Moreover, less than six months ago the principal government official responsible for this issue estimated that the Vietnamese had released less than 1 percent of the information available to them.  Representative Ben Gilman of New York has introduced H. R. 2521, a P.O.W.-M.I.A. full accounting bill. Mr. Gilman lists 27 issues that must be addressed, many by the Vietnamese.  Last week in a letter to President Clinton, I noted Vietnamese manipulation and lack of cooperation and urged him to hold the line on International Monetary Fund loan authority. We believe he was on track in the pledge made to us at our 1992 national convention in Chicago, when he said if he was elected the files would be thrown open, the roadblocks torn down and the truth would come out. He also said America must never leave its warriors on the battlefield.

"   , Vietnam, July 11   Denying again that it had held any American prisoners of war after 1973, Vietnam presented three retired Vietnamese colonels who tried to discredit a source of reports to the contrary. But a visiting United States Senator said he would continue to investigate reports that prisoners were still being held.  ""We have evidence to the contrary and we just have to pursue it,"" Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, said at a news conference after a four-day trip to investigate reported sightings of American P.O.W.'s.  After Senator Smith left, the retired Vietnamese officers held a news conference at which they tried to discredit reports by Robert R. Garwood, who accompanied Mr. Smith to Vietnam. Mr. Garwood asserts that as a Marine private he was held by the Vietnamese from 1965 to 1979 and that he saw several American prisoners in 1977.  However, one of the Vietnamese officers, Nguyen Thai, said that in 1967 Mr. Garwood asked to remain in Vietnam after he was offered freedom.  ""We were ordered by the upper level that if he didn't want to go to the United States, he might be integrated into Vietnamese society,"" Mr. Thai said, adding that Mr. Garwood was regarded ""not as a U.S. prisoner but as a U.S. associate of the Vietnamese people, not an enemy."" The three retired officers said Mr. Garwood had worked on propaganda directed against American troops. After Mr. Garwood returned to the United States in 1979, he was convicted of collaborating with the enemy.  Earlier, Senator Smith, who had visited several areas where American prisoners were reportedly seen after the United States withdrawal in 1973, said that information from Mr. Garwood had checked out and that the credibility of other sources had been enhanced.  In response, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said at the news conference with Senator Smith that ""there's no proof whatsoever that there were prisoners and particularly prisoners still alive and being kept in Vietnam.""

"   , Thailand, July 17   The United States will station diplomats in Vietnam for the first time since the Vietnam war under a plan disclosed today by senior American and Vietnamese officials.  The three diplomats would help the growing number of American families who visit Vietnam seeking information about missing soldiers. There have been no United States diplomats stationed in Hanoi since the French colonial period, which ended in 1954; and United States diplomats left Saigon in the south in the closing days of the Vietnam War in 1975.  The arrival of the officials should not be misread as a sign that Washington is preparing for normal relations with Hanoi, said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.  But diplomats and Vietnamese officials are sure to see it that way, since it will allow the State Department to have day-to-day contacts with the Vietnamese Government.  The plan, proposed by the United States, was announced today in Hanoi after two days of talks on broader cooperation in investigating the fate of the 2,253 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina.  The 22-member United States delegation, led by Mr. Lord, was dispatched by President Clinton earlier this month when he announced his decision to end Washington's opposition to loans to Vietnam by international development agencies.  Mr. Lord said in Hanoi today that he had been given a letter for President Clinton from President Le Duc Anh that promised continued cooperation on the M.I.A.'s. ""I can tell you that it expresses great appreciation for the President's decision on the clearing up of Vietnam's debts,"" Mr. Lord said.  President Clinton has said that Vietnam would have to expand its assistance in resolving the fate of missing Americans if it wanted Washington to consider normalizing relations. He has kept a United States trade embargo imposed when Vietnam was unified under Communist rule in 1975.  At a news conference, Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said Hanoi was already offering its full cooperation in the search for missing Americans. ""But of course there will be more determination and more efforts, and that will lead to more results,"" he said.  The Defense Department already has a presence in Vietnam -- investigators who work with the Vietnamese to resolve the M.I.A. cases. American officials said that the presence of the diplomats would free the Pentagon teams to concentrate on the investigations.  Mr. Lord said his delegation, which included representatives of veterans' groups, had ""laid considerable emphasis"" on human rights issues. ""We intend to pursue this matter, and the Vietnamese side was very open,"" he said.  The Vietnamese M.I.A.'s  On Friday, the United States gave Vietnam microfiche copies of Communist documents seized during the war, to help Hanoi determine the fate of 300,000 missing Vietnamese.  Leaders of the veterans' groups said they were pleased with the promises of cooperation, but they warned that the cooperation must be complete.  ""If the Vietnamese follow through on what they've pledged, I think there will be great cause for rejoicing,"" said David Givans, of the Disabled American Veterans. ""If they don't, I think it will cause irreparable harm to this whole process.""

"    XOM, Laos, Aug. 5   Human remains and the wreckage of crashed aircraft have been found in northern Laos by an American military search team looking for servicemen lost in the Indochina war.  The Americans are investigating 32 crashes around the Plain of Jars, a remote highland region that was a major theater of the war from 1964 to 1973.  In July, with the help of dozens of Laotian laborers, the Americans began excavating a site on the crest of a hill near the village of Ban Xom, 75 miles north of the capital, Vientiane. Laotian officials said on Wednesday that the searchers had discovered bone fragments among what remained of the aircraft wreckage.  American officers have refused discuss details of what had been found. But Capt. On Chanh of the Laotian Army, who is working with the Americans, said the wreckage was of an F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber. The site is a few miles northeast of Muang Phonsavan, the provincial capital, and is reached by a 30-minute uphill hike from National Route 7, a main road to northern Vietnam.  Vice Foreign Minister Soubanh Sarithirath inspected the site at Ban Xom on Monday along with Lieut. Col. John Kendall of the United States. Mr. Soubanh Sarithirath was shown an area where the human remains were found and pieces of wreckage.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 19   Vietnam prevented Senator Charles Robb of Virginia from seeing a prominent jailed Vietnamese dissident today, and Senator Robb said Hanoi had lost a chance to send a positive signal on relations with Washington.  Mr. Robb, who arrived in Ho Chi Minh City in the morning, said he had an appointment to meet Nguyen Dan Que, a doctor jailed for 20 years in 1991 for ""subversive activities against the people's power.""  The Democratic legislator told reporters later in Hanoi that when he arrived, he was told the appointment was canceled.  Mr. Que, 51, is one of the most prominent imprisoned Vietnamese dissidents. He was the first member in Vietnam of the human rights group Amnesty International.

"      A new Russian document suggesting that Vietnam held more American prisoners of war than it acknowledged has been turned over to American authorities in Moscow.  The Pentagon released a translation of an account of a Vietnamese Communist Party meeting held in late 1970 or early 1971, quoting a Vietnamese official, Khoang Anya, as saying Vietnam held 735 ""American aviator P.O.W.'s"" although it had only given out the names of 368.  Earlier this year another document from Soviet military intelligence files was released, quoting another Vietnamese official as saying 1,205 Americans were held in September 1972. Only 591 were released the next year after the peace accords were signed.  The Pentagon, in a statement released Tuesday night, said it could not yet vouch either for the statement's authenticity or its accuracy. The statement did say it ""came from the files of the G.R.U. -- Soviet military intelligence.""  Senator Criticizes Pentagon  But Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who has made the cause of missing servicemen the chief focus of his Senate career, called it ""dramatic and deeply troubling"" and dismissed the Pentagon's reservations as ""pitiful.""  He said the new material was consistent with the 1972 document found by a Harvard scholar in January and officially turned over to the United States in April. It is now generally regarded by American officials as an authentic Soviet intelligence document, although most of them believe it is not an accurate record of the Vietnamese meeting it describes.  They also contend the Vietnamese could not have captured as many Americans as they claimed to be holding at that time, and argue that the term ""prisoners of war"" was not used by the Vietnamese although it was used in the account. That term also appears in the new document.  Mr. Smith also said ""these new revelations"" were an additional reason why President Clinton should maintain the trade embargo against Hanoi, which would expire next Tuesday unless he acts. Senator Smith said that giving up this ""leverage"" against Vietnam would ""constitute abandonment of our remaining P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s.""  What the Pentagon released on Tuesday was a translation from Russian of pages 11 and 18 from a report headed this way:  ""General Staff of the Armed Forces of the U.S.S.R.  ""Main Intelligence Directorate  ""Top Secret.  ""Copy No. ---  ""Report  ""Of Khoang Anya, secretary of the central committee of the W.P.V. at the plenum of the C.C. W.P.V. at the end of December 1970 -- beginning of 1971  ""(Translation from Vietnamese)""  The cover sheet and pages 11 and 18 were the only parts of the document given last Thursday to Malcolm Toon, the United States co-chairman of the American-Russian Joint Commission on P.O.W./M.I.A.'s. American officials said the incomplete nature of the material would make it harder to analyze.  References to U.S. Prisoners  The most compelling reference to American prisoners came on page 18, where Khoang Anya was quoted as saying: ""The total number of American aviator P.O.W.'s in the S.R.V. is 735. As I have already said, we have published the names of 368 aviators. This is our diplomatic step. If the Americans agree to the withdrawal of all their troops from South Vietnam, we will, as a start, return these 368 people. And when the Americans withdraw their troops we will return to them the rest.""  In his earlier reference, on page 11, he said: ""When we published the names of 368 American fliers, shot down and captured on the territory of the S.R.V., opportunists began to say this was a concession to the Americans. This is not correct. It is not a concession, but a political blow aimed at Nixon. We have achieved much through this.""  The Vietnamese list of 368 prisoners was delivered in Paris, on Dec. 22, 1970, to representatives of two antiwar Democrats, Senators J. William Fulbright of Arkansas and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. The total of 368 included 20 who had died of wounds or in captivity and nine who had already been freed. At that time the Pentagon said the list did not include 10 airmen it believed were prisoners, and 412 other Americans listed as missing in action, most of whom it believed were dead.  Officials here would not discuss their preliminary view of the latest document. But they were understood to believe that it had indeed come from the archives of Soviet military intelligence and was probably an authentic document, but referred to more American prisoners than could possibly have been captured, and thus was based on sloppy or inaccurate reporting.  Stephen J. Morris, the Harvard scholar who unearthed the earlier document, said in a telephone interview that he could not judge the validity of this one, having seen only the translation.  But he said he believed that in translating back and forth between Vietnamese, Russian and English, the name of the quoted official had been mangled. He said the official appeared to be Hoang Anh, a member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers Party and of its secretariat. He held a sub-ministerial position in charge of resettlement.

"   , Vietnam, Sept. 9   Vietnam today rejected a Soviet document suggesting that Hanoi held more American prisoners of war than it had acknowledged in the early 1970's, asserting that figures in the document resulted from ""misunderstanding of information or deliberate fabrication.""  A Foreign Ministry spokesman, in Hanoi's first formal comment on the report, said North Vietnam held 580 American and allied prisoners when the Paris peace accords were signed in January 1973. Two months later, after United States forces withdrew, Hanoi released 591 American prisoners.  ""Since then and up until now, no American prisoner of war has been held in Vietnam,"" the spokesman said. ""This is the truth. All other figures on the American prisoners in Vietnam are not correct because of misunderstanding of information or deliberate fabrication.""  The Pentagon said the document, a translation of an account of a Vietnamese Communist Party meeting held in late 1970 or early 1971, quoted a Vietnamese official as saying North Vietnam was holding 735 ""American aviator P.O.W.'s,"" although it provided the names of only 368.  The Second Document  The newly released document, from Soviet military intelligence, was given to American officials at a meeting in Moscow. Although the document quoted comments supposedly made about prisoners at a the Vietnamese Communist Party meeting, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said the issue was not discussed at the time.  A furor erupted in April after the publication of another document from Soviet archives, which Vietnam also denounced as a fabrication, that suggested that Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners in 1972.  But the controversy had died down by July, when President Clinton made a major concession to Hanoi by taking steps to lift a United States ban on new lending to Vietnam by the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral agencies.  Mr. Clinton is due to decide by next Tuesday whether to renew his authority to maintain embargoes against Vietnam, North Korea and Cuba.  More Delays Likely  He is expected to renew them, despite improvements in relations between Hanoi and Washington this year that have given Vietnam and American businesses the hope that the President would take steps to end the embargo against Vietnam. But it appeared likely that the new document would at least delay any such action.  Moreover, Mr. Clinton would find it difficult to move in this direction if there were any doubt about Vietnam's truthfulness on determining the fate of the 2,248 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina.  After the Pentagon released the document this week, Congressional critics of Vietnam urged Mr. Clinton not to lift the embargo.  Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, said Wednesday that the document was ""dramatic and deeply troubling."" It indicated that ""several hundred more American P.O.W.'s should have been returned by the North Vietnamese, and were not, for whatever reason,"" he said in a statement faxed by his office.  Mr. Smith said he had urged President Clinton to keep the embargo to maintain leverage on Vietnam and ""to do anything less would constitute abandonment of our remaining P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s.""

"      In its second easing of the economic embargo against Vietnam in the last two months, the Clinton Administration said today that American companies could bid for construction and development projects there that were financed by the World Bank and other international lending institutions.  The Administration cited Hanoi's cooperation in helping to determine the fate of the more than 2,200 American servicemen who never came home from the war in Southeast Asia.  But in announcing the partial lifting of the embargo, the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said the bulk of the trade sanctions would be maintained, ""to make clear to the Vietnamese that more needs to be done"" in accounting for Americans still missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  President Clinton also renewed his authority to maintain sanctions against Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea and several other countries under the Trading With the Enemy Act. If Mr. Clinton had declined to act, all of those sanctions would have lapsed on Tuesday.  On July 2, the Administration announced that it would not try to block a number of countries, including Japan, France and Australia, that wanted to pay off Vietnam's $140 million foreign debt. Once that debt was cleared, Hanoi would be eligible for loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Officials at the World Bank have been putting together plans for $500 million to $800 million in new projects in Vietnam over five years.  Experts on the subject say the projects include dams and irrigation systems, roads and power plants. American engineering and construction companies would now be allowed to bid on these projects.  ""I think it's a positive step,"" said Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council, a group that hopes to foster economic links between the two countries. ""I hope it's a continuation of steps toward full economic normalization.""  American energy companies seeking to exploit what some think are lucrative oil fields in the South China Sea and United States aircraft makers seeking contracts with Hanoi for commercial jets will gain little from today's announcement.  ""I'm certainly disappointed that they did not lift the sanctions overall,"" Ms. Foote said. ""But this is a positive step, small as it is.""  In July, when the Administration said it would no longer stand in the way of lending by international development banks, some experts said that today's decision was inevitable. Since the United States provides about 19 percent of the funds for institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, keeping the embargo completely in force would have meant that American taxpayers would have supported development projects in Vietnam on which American businesses would not have been able to compete.  Officials of groups representing relatives of many of those listed as unaccounted for condemned today's action, saying the information given American investigators by Hanoi was inadequate.  ""The Vietnamese are stiffing us, and the bureaucracy's assessment of their cooperation is nothing more than a scam,"" said Ann Griffths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.

"   , Vietnam, Sept. 14   The Vietnamese Government expressed disappointment today over President Clinton's decision to loosen rather than lift the 18-year-old economic embargo against Vietnam.  Mr. Clinton relaxed sanctions Monday to allow American companies to bid on Vietnamese projects financed by international lenders like the World Bank. He did not specify the size or type of projects companies would be able to compete for.  The Presidential spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said the overall embargo was being maintained ""to make clear to the Vietnamese that more needs to be done"" to settle the issue of missing American servicemen in Vietnam.  Ho The Lan, spokeswoman for Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, welcomed the partial lifting of the sanctions.  ""However, it is regrettable that the U.S.A. still continues the embargo policy against Vietnam that runs counter to the development trends in the region and the world,"" she said in a statement.  The embargo was imposed in 1975, after Communist North Vietnam defeated South Vietnam and unified the country.  While the statement described the embargo as a ""violation"" of Vietnam's right to develop, it said American policy does not hinder Vietnam's widening international relations or its strategy for economic development.  ""It only ties up the American business circle, depriving them of a chance for equal competition in Vietnam,"" the statement said.  Greig Craft, an American businessman who consults in Vietnam for Motorola and Occidental Petroleum, said Mr. Clinton's decision would mean the loss of millions of dollars in business for American companies.  But James Rockwell, a Hanoi-based consultant for Chrysler Corporation and other American companies, said the gesture was meaningful. ""American companies can genuinely set up operations,"" he said.  Vietnamese officials had been hoping for an end to the embargo, given what they say has been their full cooperation in helping to resolve the cases of 2,248 missing American servicemen.  Miss Lan's statement said Vietnam would continue to help resolve the issue of missing Americans. And the commander of the American office on the missing in Hanoi, Lieut. Col. John Cray of the Army, commended the Vietnamese for their recent assistance.  LOAD-DATE: September 15, 1993  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 15 1993 ,11
"    Sooner or later some American President will find the courage to end Washington's now-pointless vendetta against Communist Vietnam. That President might as well be Bill Clinton and the time might as well be now.  The public debate on U.S. Vietnam policy focuses on Hanoi's cooperation in locating the remains of servicemen listed as missing in action since the Vietnam War. But the biggest obstacle to normal diplomatic and economic relations is America's wounded national pride and White House fears of a ferocious backlash.  This week President Clinton took the latest in a series of modest steps meant to reward increased Vietnamese cooperation in the search for M.I.A.'s.  George Bush began the process last year by letting U.S. companies prospect for future business in Vietnam. Then Mr. Clinton dropped longstanding American objections to loans for Vietnam from international development banks. He also stationed American diplomats in Vietnam for the first time since the war's end. On Monday the Administration announced that U.S. companies could bid for business financed by the development loans.  These steps are all welcome, but there's no good reason not to go all the way.  Controversial documents recently unearthed from Soviet archives suggest that Hanoi may have understated the number of prisoners it held 20 years ago. But despite the claims of Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire and others, there's no persuasive evidence that any Americans are still being held. Meanwhile, Clinton Administration officials report that Vietnam's Government is actively cooperating in the search for M.I.A. remains.  Even if Americans were being held captive, the chances of discovering them could only be improved by an increased U.S. diplomatic and business presence in Vietnam. If convincing new evidence were found, American sanctions could be reimposed, and allies could be asked to join in.  The embargo did apply effective pressure on Vietnam in the 1980's, when other countries also restricted trade and investment to protest Hanoi's occupation of Cambodia. But most countries dropped their restrictions when Vietnam withdrew its troops and cooperated with efforts to establish an elected Cambodian government.  Now America's European allies, along with the main non-Communist governments of Asia, are forging new links with Hanoi, sustaining its pro-market reforms and encouraging its peaceful integration into the Asia-Pacific region. With the rest of the world investing and trading in Vietnam, the U.S. embargo has little effect. In the small Vietnamese market, America's absent companies are readily replaced.  America's interest in Vietnam lies in successful reform and regional integration, not endless refighting of the domestic politics of the Vietnam War. There may never be a politically smart time to take the plunge. But the right time is now.

"      Citing progress on Vietnam's efforts to determine the fate of missing Americans, the Clinton Administration is moving toward easing the economic embargo against Hanoi and plans to consult Congress about it early in the new year, Administration officials said today.  A senior Administration official said that President Clinton's top foreign policy advisers would meet ""very soon"" to decide whether to recommend the lifting of the embargo, which was imposed after the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the advisers were ""clearly moving toward an easing of the embargo.""  The advisers last week discussed a range of options, from partial abandonment of the embargo -- including allowing some American companies to enter into contracts with the Vietnamese for a trial period -- to a total lifting of the ban.  A 'Reciprocal Gesture'  The advisers met after Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, returned from a trip to Southeast Asia in mid-December with an upbeat assessment.  Mr. Lord argued in favor of taking some immediate action to ease the embargo to reward Hanoi for its help in finding out what happened to the more than 2,000 American servicemen who did not return from the Vietnam War.  ""Lord felt there had been significant progress made and had argued that the Vietnamese were now expecting to see some kind of reciprocal gesture that would be aimed at easing the embargo,"" one official said. He added that the Vietnamese were not expecting full normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi at this time.  Mr. Lord is on a skiing vacation and could not be reached for comment.  A Nettlesome Issue  The trade sanctions against Hanoi have been a nettlesome issue for the Clinton Administration. As a candidate, Mr. Clinton pledged there would be no easing of the embargo until Hanoi made a ""full accounting"" of missing Americans. Yet that position is at odds with the Administration's emphasis on expanding overseas trade to improve the American economy.  With its well-educated, highly disciplined and motivated people and its natural resources, including offshore deposits of oil and natural gas, Vietnam is considered to have great economic potential. American businesses and a number of members of Congress, both Democratic and Republican, have been pressing for an end to the trade embargo lest American companies lose out to European and Japanese competitors in exploiting the growing Vietnamese market.  Some veterans groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars have also supported the idea of closer ties with Vietnam so long as progress is made on the prisoner of war issue.  But vocal opposition by organizations representing families of missing Americans and by other veterans groups, including the American Legion, has placed a political roadblock in the way of better relations between Hanoi and Washington.   The Pace Quickens  Because Mr. Clinton's avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War has been a hot political potato, he has tried not to offend opponents of liberalized relations. There are a few members of Congress who are fiercely opposed to widened ties, but their numbers are dropping and in any event the President does not need the approval of Congress to widen diplomatic or trade relations with Vietnam.  While the officials said that no decision has been made on whether to lift the embargo, the pace towards normalization appears to be quickening.  Last week's meeting of foreign policy advisers, reported in The Washington Post today, was the first time they had gathered to consider the next steps to take since Mr. Clinton eased the trade embargo in September. At that time, Mr. Clinton permitted American companies to bid for projects in Vietnam financed by international lending institutions.  The decision in September followed a policy shift in July, when President Clinton said the United States would no longer try to block loans to Vietnam from institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. At that time, Mr. Clinton's advisers said that the lifting of the economic embargo would be conditioned on solid progress in learning the fate of the servicemen.  Mr. Clinton specifically said he would require tangible progress by Vietnam is four areas: repatriating the remains of Americans known to have died in Southeast Asia; supplying documents that could help in the search; assisting in cases in which downed American airmen were suspected of being alive but were not returned in the large-scale prisoner release in 1973, and working with the Government of Laos to determine what happened to American airmen who were downed in that country.  Virtually all those listed as missing are presumed dead, but the failure to find remains has fueled speculation over the years that some might be alive and held captive by the Vietnamese. For its part, Hanoi lists more than 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers, sailors and airmen as missing from the Indochina war.  Search Team Meets  During his three-day trip, Mr. Lord received the remains of what the Vietnamese said were eight dead Americans at a ceremony in Hanoi. The repatriation brings to 67 the number of remains the Vietnamese have returned this year. Mr. Lord also traveled to Lao Bao, a village on the Vietnam-Laos border, for the first meeting of the United States-Vietnam-Lao search team.  Mr. Lord, whose trip to Vietnam was his second in five months, praised the Vietnamese cooperation on the issue of missing Americans as ""absolutely superb."" At another point during his trip he told reporters, ""If you look over the whole year, we've made very good progress, indeed, tangible progress.""  For his part, Mr. Lord gave the Vietnamese three million microfiche pages of captured wartime documents to aid Hanoi in the search for its missing troops. And he announced that Washington was giving Hanoi $2 million help it reintegrate returning Vietnamese boat people.  In their meetings with Mr. Lord, Vietnamese officials told the American envoy that Hanoi wanted to ""proceed toward normalization as soon as possible.""

"      In another sign of improving ties between Hanoi and Washington, Adm. Charles R. Larson, commander of United States forces in the Pacific, will visit Hanoi this month, the highest-ranking American military officer on active duty to go to Vietnam since the war in Southeast Asia ended in 1975.  Admiral Larson, a four-star officer based in Hawaii, is to go to Vietnam on Jan. 16 for three days to review the work of American and Vietnamese specialists investigating the fate of missing Americans. Admiral Larson is also expected to meet with high-ranking officials in the Foreign Ministry.  The Administration is moving toward easing the trade embargo against Hanoi, and has conditioned a relaxation of the embargo on resolving the fate of more than 2,000 servicemen who did not return from the Vietnam War.  An upbeat assessment from a senior commander like Admiral Larson that Vietnam is cooperating fully would provide the Administration with a defense against complaints that could come from veterans' groups that oppose closer ties to Hanoi.  As a candidate, Bill Clinton promised that he would not lift the embargo until Hanoi made a ""full accounting"" of missing Americans. But Mr. Clinton eased the sanctions slightly last September when he allowed American companies to bid for projects in Vietnam financed by international lending institutions.  The admiral's visit will come a month after Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asia, returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. Mr. Lord argued in favor of immediate action to ease the embargo to reward Hanoi for its help in resolving the M.I.A. issue.  Admiral Larson, a former submarine captain who served as President Richard M. Nixon's naval aide during the Vietnam War, will meet with American civilian and military investigators in Hanoi and with specialists excavating crash sites and pouring over archives in various parts of the country.  His visit coincides with the largest field inquiry the United States and Vietnam have conducted together since Washington began sending investigators to Vietnam in 1988. The American team of 84 specialists, including archeologists and linguists, intends to investigate as many as 89 cases and excavate as many as 13 sites, the Pentagon said in a statement.  There are 2,239 Americans unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. Of those, 1,648 were lost in Vietnam.   LOAD-DATE: January 6, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 6 1994 ,11
"    Put aside, for a moment, the emotional claims of a war a quarter-century ago that nearly tore America apart. The best reason to end the U.S. economic embargo on Vietnam is that it no longer serves American interests.  With the rest of the world trading freely with Hanoi, the embargo punishes American businesses far more than it punishes the Vietnamese. And if the embargo were effective, it would be perverse. Present Vietnamese economic and foreign policies warrant encouragement, not punishment.  But as the Clinton Administration is again discovering, the emotional claims are not easily put aside. Washington's top Asian diplomat, Winston Lord, recently returned from Vietnam reporting that Hanoi is cooperating in the search for information about Americans missing in action since the war, in exactly the ways Washington has suggested could bring a relaxation of the embargo. The commander of U.S. Pacific Forces, Adm. Charles Larson, will also be visiting this month. But before responding to Hanoi's latest efforts, the Administration has decided to consult its political advisers. This news has already restarted the old debates.  Arguing against relaxation are many families of American M.I.A.'s who feel that Hanoi's cooperation has not gone far enough. While about 2,000 Americans are officially listed as missing in action, all but about 100 are now reasonably presumed to have died in battle or captivity before the end of the war. The fate of the rest is less clear. While both Hanoi and the Nixon Administration declared that all surviving American prisoners of war had returned in April 1973, newly declassified information suggests that the Pentagon believed some might have been left behind, especially in Laos.  That suggests duplicity, by Washington and probably by Hanoi, which promised to return all Americans held in Indochina. But does it suggest that Hanoi still holds American prisoners? No one has found hard evidence to support such a claim, despite a yearlong Senate investigation and the Pentagon's own search missions under the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations.  It is understandable that M.I.A. families remain skeptical, given the evidence that they have been lied to. But how long should American policy be driven by suspicion of old misdeeds that no one today can do anything about?  On the other side of the argument is the reality of Vietnam today. It has transformed its economy along capitalist lines. It has abandoned military interventionism. And it enjoys warm relations with such anti-Communist neighbors as Taiwan, South Korea and the Philippines. In many ways it is as if Saigon, not Hanoi, had won the war. Today's Vietnam represents a deferred victory for some of America's original policy goals.  More than two decades ago, when America was agonizing over how to extricate itself honorably from Vietnam with many of those goals unmet, a Republican Senator from Vermont, George Aiken, offered a simple suggestion: Declare victory and get out. Today America has a much more attractive option on Vietnam, if only it is bold enough to take it: Declare victory and get in.

"   , Vietnam, Jan. 6   United States troops with picks and shovels spread out across 600 miles of Vietnam today, searching former battlefields for soldiers missing since the Vietnam War.  The search, the largest since the end of the war, involves 84 Americans in eight teams and runs three weeks.  The search was previously concentrated in northern Vietnam and in Laos, where hundreds of airmen went down on bombing and other missions. But the new search has turned south, to what was South Vietnam before it fell in 1975.  The battlefields being searched include Tay Ninh, northwest of Ho Chi Minh City, the current name for Saigon. Tay Ninh was the scene of some of the fiercest fighting and the gateway for the United States invasion of Cambodia in 1970.  Other areas being searched are Kontum and Pleiku in the central highlands and Ban Me Thuot, the southern anchor of South Vietnam's defenses.  Officials are still identifying remains found earlier. In Washington, the Pentagon today identified remains found last June as those of Navy Lieut. (j.g.) Barry E. Karger, of Prather, Calif., whose plane was downed over North Vietnam on May 14, 1968.  The new search for M.I.A.'s has added significance as Washington reviews whether to lift its 19-year trade embargo against Vietnam. President Clinton has said his decision is contingent on progress in getting the best possible accounting of the 2,239 troops still listed as missing.  Five Congressional delegations are to arrive in Hanoi over the next 10 days to assess the situation. The first is due Saturday, led by Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana and chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  LOAD-DATE: January 7, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 6 1994 ,11
"    To the Editor:  ""Vietnam: An Outdated Embargo"" (editorial, Jan. 6) prematurely calls for the United States to ""declare victory and get out,"" normalizing relations with Hanoi. The Vietnam War taught us to think carefully before jumping in and to avoid false declarations of victory, two lessons you miss.  Vietnam, unlike its former Communist allies, has not ""transformed its economy along capitalist lines,"" as you suggest. Although the economic devastation caused by decades of drought, corruption and mismanagement prompted some reforms by Hanoi to boost foreign investment and aid, just last June the Communist Party Central Committee repeated its unequivocal commitment to the Marxist-Leninist tradition.  And this tradition includes flagrant disregard for the rights of its citizens. In 1991, the first member of Amnesty International in Vietnam was sent to prison for 20 years because he petitioned the Government to ""respect the human, civil and property rights of the people."" Eight prominent intellectuals were imprisoned last year for ""attempting to overthrow the Government."" They had producing a hand-typed newsletter suggesting democratic reforms. Last year also, two Vietnamese Buddhists -- one in Hue and one in Connecticut -- torched themselves to protest Hanoi's religious persecution. But their deaths have been wasted, ignored by an international press eager to show magnanimity by calls for reconciliation.  Reconciliation may be warranted, but not at any cost. Hanoi's unprecedented concessions on the missing in action issue show that it is desperate to have the embargo lifted. This responsiveness means that the United States has the leverage to demand that Vietnam should also answer to its rights abuses before we normalize relations.  VIET D.

"      The Clinton Administration has reached a consensus about lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam, but has taken steps to reduce the political backlash expected from veterans groups.  These steps include meeting with veterans groups, starting talks with Hanoi about its human rights performance and sending an admiral to assess progress in learning about Americans missing in Vietnam.  These efforts come as the American Legion and groups representing Americans missing in action have begun an intensive campaign to press the Administration to maintain the embargo. They argue that Vietnam is still hiding information about the fate of 2,239 Americans missing in Indochina and that lifting the embargo would remove the pressure for Hanoi to cooperate.  Some Administration officials say the move could be announced by the end of the month, although one official said that despite the consensus Mr. Clinton could still bow to political pressures and decide to let the embargo stand. ""The President will make his decision based on what he thinks is best on the question"" of missing Americans, a senior Administration official said. ""If he feels that acknowledging past cooperation will help get future cooperation, he'll take another step forward.""  The embargo presents Mr. Clinton with a classic clash between domestic political pressures and foreign policy considerations: Vietnam would accuse him of breaking his promise to lift the embargo if it cooperated in helping Washington learn the fates of the missing Americans.  Veterans groups began their lobbying campaign after learning that Administration officials, including those from the Pentagon, had agreed at an interagency meeting in December to lift the embargo. Before taking that step, however, the Administration decided to take political soundings around the country, and the veterans groups are trying to make those soundings as negative as possible.  To help overcome opposition to lifting the embargo, the Administration has sent Adm. Charles R. Larson, commander of American forces in the Pacific, to Vietnam with the hope that he will give the Pentagon's seal of approval to Hanoi's help in determining the fates of missing Americans. Last July President Clinton pledged not to lift the embargo until Hanoi cooperated in providing ""the fullest possible accounting"" about those missing.  In another move to defuse anticipated criticisms, the Administration agreed last week to begin a dialogue with Vietnamese officials to press them on the human rights issue. Echoing the views of many veterans groups, Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who was wounded in Vietnam, said the embargo should not be lifted until the United States sent a delegation to Vietnam to examine its human rights performance.  ""We've only recently begun to talk about the thing we fought the war for -- the freedom of the Vietnamese people,"" Mr. Kerrey said in an interview.  The Administration argues that lifting the embargo would be the best way to get the most information about missing Americans from the Vietnamese. This would increase the American business presence in Vietnam, the argument goes, and the greater the number of Americans there, the more Americans could learn.  But in a letter to the President, Bruce Thiesen, national commander of the 3.1-million-member American Legion, wrote, ""To lift the embargo now would eliminate any remaining leverage we have to attempt to encourage real cooperation.""  The veterans groups and the Administration clash sharply over how well Vietnam is cooperating in accounting for the missing Americans. On a visit to Vietnam last month, Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord spoke of ""tangible results"" in determining the fate of missing servicemen. Administration officials said that Hanoi had turned over 67 sets of remains last year -- the third highest number since the war ended two decades ago -- and a large number of documents. But veterans groups maintain that there are still a lot of remains and documents to be turned over.  LOAD-DATE: January 19, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 16 1994 ,11
"      Continuing to tiptoe toward ending the trade embargo on Vietnam, the Clinton Administration announced plans today to open talks with Hanoi to settle millions of dollars in financial claims arising from the Communist defeat of the South Vietnamese Government in 1975.  The Administration is leaning toward lifting the embargo, and today's move appears part of orchestrated efforts to clear the way toward ending the embargo and minimizing the political backlash to such a move.  The American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, and relatives of servicemen missing in action are eager to keep the embargo and have begun a campaign to warn the President that lifting it would be unpopular and politically dangerous.   Political Soundings  Administration officials reached a consensus at an interagency meeting last month to end the embargo, but officials said that before making that politically sensitive move they first wanted to make political soundings.  State Department officials said Washington and Hanoi were still discussing dates for the talks, which some experts estimate involve more than $200 million in claims for confiscated property, including claims related to the seizure of the American Embassy.  Administration officials maintained that the claims dispute was not an obstacle to lifting the 19-year-old embargo, but resolving it could reduce overall tensions. Last July President Clinton said the only factor he would weigh in determining whether to end the embargo was if Hanoi was cooperating in providing ""the fullest possible accounting"" for the 2,239 Americans listed as missing in Indochina.  The announcement today follows several other recent moves that the Clinton Administration has made to minimize the political backlash to ending the embargo. Last week, it announced plans to start talks with Vietnam about improving its human rights performance, and it also began the biggest excavation efforts since the war ended to search for remains of Americans. In addition, the Administration has sent Adm. Charles R. Larson, commander of the American forces in the Pacific, to Hanoi to assess Vietnam's cooperation in helping Washington learn about the missing.  Bentsen Is Optimistic  Despite the vigorous campaign by veterans' groups, the Administration still appears to be leaning toward lifting the embargo. Last Tuesday in Bangkok, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said he was optimistic that the embargo would be lifted soon.  ""As has been the case with other countries on other issues, a stategy of engagement with Vietnam may be the most effective way to promote our goal of accounting for P.O.W.'s and M. I. A. 's from the war,"" he said.  To help sell an end to the embargo, the Administration is arguing that the best way to learn more about Americans missing in Indochina would be to increase ties with Hanoi and increase the American presence in that country. But the American Legion argues that the best way to force more cooperation from Hanoi is to maintain the leverage of economic sanctions. In the Administration's view, even if it removes the embargo, it can hold diplomatic relations as another carrot.  ""I think the Vietnam embargo is going to be history,"" said Gary L. Ackerman, a Democrat from Queens who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.""That's pretty much a foregone conclusion. I just think it's a matter of the politically correct timing.""  Clinton and the Draft  Administration officials concede that the embargo decision is especially difficult for President Clinton because of his steps to avoid the military draft in the Vietnam War and because of allegations that Commerce Secretary Ron Brown received money to help push for closer ties with Vietnam.  Some officials fear that Republicans on Capitol Hill will accuse the President of selling out the M.I.A.'s if he lifts the embargo. But the Administration has taken comfort in the fact that five Republican senators have over the last month spoken out in favor of lifting the embargo.  Administration officials also acknowledge that it is taking American economic interests into account in deciding whether to end the embargo. They note that American businesses have been forced to wait on the sidelines while Vietnam links up with foreign businesses.  For instance, officials at the Boeing Company -- the company that Mr. Clinton has often trumpeted as the nation's leading exporter -- note that because of the embargo Boeing lost an order for four 737's that Hanoi had tentatively agreed to buy. Hanoi instead obtained the needed planes from Airbus, the European consortium.  Criticized by Veterans  Veterans' groups criticize the Clinton Administration for even considering economic factors in the equation. In a letter to the President, the Disabled American Veterans said, ""It would be deplorable and deceitful to give up our nation's quest for the fullest possible accounting of our missing servicemen just to pad the bottom lines of a few American corporations.""  For the most part, businesses have refused to lobby vigorously on this issue because they do not want to give the impression that they are uncaring about the nation's M.I.A.'s.

"      As President Clinton makes tentative moves toward lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam, a fight has broken out on Capitol Hill over the politically sensitive issue, with some Republicans proposing to create strict conditions before the embargo can be removed.  Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, says he is likely to introduce a measure designed to force President Clinton to maintain the embargo by setting conditions on Vietnam that are considerably stricter than those President Clinton set forth in September.  Opponents of the embargo fear that Senator Smith's amendment could pass because it includes several conditions that could be politically difficult to oppose.  Seeking to defuse Senator Smith's measure, which is to be introduced this week, Senator John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, announced today that he had concluded on his trip last week to Vietnam that it was time to lift the embargo. He said he was convinced that Vietnam had gone to great lengths to cooperate on accounting for the missing Americans.  Seen as Hurting Economy  Mr. Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran who was chairman of the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, becomes one of more than a dozen Senators who favor lifting the embargo, many of whom argue that it is hurting the American economy more than Vietnam's.  Senator Smith's proposal comes as the Clinton Administration has tiptoed toward lifting the embargo after a consensus emerged within the Administration last month on the issue. But Administration officials say the President will lift it only after taking political soundings on the embargo, acknowledging that it is an especially sensitive issue for him because of his avoiding military service in the Vietnam war.  Under Senator Smith's measure, an amendment to the State Department authorization bill, the President could lift the embargo only after he determined that Vietnam had resolved as fully as possible cases involving prisoners of war and servicemen missing in action where American intelligence indicates Hanoi has additional information.  Lawmakers who support lifting the embargo said it might be hard for many lawmakers to oppose Senator Smith's amendment because it appears sensible to demand that Hanoi provide the fullest possible accounting.  Seeking Information  Last July, President Clinton established more lenient criteria, suggesting that he would lift the embargo if Hanoi cooperated in providing information and documents about the 2,238 Americans missing in Indochina. The President called on Vietnam to provide documents, remains of dead American soldiers and information on Americans last seen alive and on Americans missing in Laos.  Although the Senate Republican minority leader, Bob Dole, is said to support Mr. Smith's efforts, Republican lawmakers are by no means unanimous in wanting to maintain the embargo. A half dozen Republican senators have called for lifting it, arguing, like some Administration officials, that the best way to insure continued cooperation from the Vietnamese is to lift the embargo.  ""If we lift the embargo, we will develop a larger presence in Vietnam and that's the way you obtain more information,"" said Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.  Senator Smith said he was convinced that Hanoi continued to withhold some information about American missing. He has repeatedly argued that the best way to pry more information from Hanoi was to place stricter conditions on improved relations.  20,000 Documents Cited    Senator Smith said in an interview, ""The question is, What do they have access to that they can provide to our Government about our 2,200 plus missing. Anyone who thinks they have provided us with everything they've got is either misinformed or ignoring the facts.""  In an interview today, Mr. Kerry talked of how Vietnamese officials have turned over more than 20,000 documents and artifacts over the last two-and-a-half years. He also said Hanoi's cooperation had helped resolve 123 of the 196 ""discrepancy"" cases about Americans last seen alive, such as pilots who were seen opening their parachutes after their planes were shot down. He said interviews with former Vietnamese soldiers and others have helped provided conclusive evidence that these people died.  ""This is the most complete cooperation on accounting after a war in the history of humankind,"" Senator Kerry said. ""The point Americans need to understand is there has been a remarkable journey traveled in the past two-and-a-half years and we've been getting answers.""  He acknowledged that Vietnam had probably not turned over all documents, saying that there might be incriminating documents that Hanoi did not want to disclose because that could imperil its efforts to have the embargo lifted. Mr. Kerry said it was more likely such documents would be disclosed after the embargo was ended, not before.  Senator Kerry is doing a headcount of how many Senators support lifting the embargo, and one of his aides said so many senators favored lifting the embargo that he might introduce a State of the Senate resolution urging the President to lift it.  Opponents of the embargo argue that it is hurting the American economy more than Vietnam's economy because the Vietnamese are able to buy whatever they want from Europe and Japan, while American companies are left without sales.

"      In a strong bipartisan vote intended to make it easier for President Clinton to end decades of rancor with a former enemy, the Senate voted today to urge that the trade embargo against Vietnam be lifted soon. The White House had supported the measure behind the scenes.  After an emotionally charged debate about the lessons of the Vietnam War and the fate of missing servicemen, the Senate, by a 62-to-38 vote, agreed with the bill's chief sponsor, John F. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and Vietnam veteran, who said it was time ""to put the war behind us.""  Although the resolution is not binding, Administration officials said today that it would certainly make it easier for Mr. Clinton to take the politically sensitive step of ending the 19-year embargo, closing a chapter on a war in which 58,135 Americans died.  'A Seminal Event'  ""The vote will give the President the kind of political cover he needs to lift the embargo, and I expect that relatively soon,"" said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and a sponsor of the bill, who was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years. ""I think it's a seminal event in U.S.-Vietnamese relations.""  A consensus emerged among senior Administration officials last month to lift the embargo, but they decided that action would be put off to take political soundings around the country and determine how much backlash there would be. Administration officials acknowledge that this is a particularly sensitive issue for Mr. Clinton because he, like thousands of Americans in his generation, avoided military service during the Vietnam War.  2,200 Americans Missing  Today's resolution aimed to show the President that lifting the embargo has widespread political support and is not a betrayal, as some veterans groups argue, of servicemen missing in Vietnam. Forty-two Democrats and 20 Republicans voted to lift the embargo; 14 Democrats and 24 Republicans voted against.  Last summer, President Clinton indicated he would lift the embargo if Vietnam cooperated in providing the fullest possible accounting for the more than 2,200 Americans missing in Indochina.  Now, the question in the Administration is not whether the embargo will be lifted, but how soon, though some officials say the President needs to do some more explaining to veterans' groups and families of missing servicemen.  The White House regarded the vote as useful in calling attention to the progress that Vietnam has made in meeting the conditions set by the Administration, officials said. But they said they did not expect Mr. Clinton to follow the Senate recommendation immediately.  Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, said, ""We certainly welcome the Senate's sentiment."" But she said the Administration was still considering whether Vietnam had made sufficient progress toward providing information about P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s and on other fronts for full relations to be restored.  Many veterans' groups and family groups opposed today's resolution, arguing that Vietnam has not done enough to resolve the cases of missing Americans.  American Legion Opposes Move  ""The American Legion is both disappointed and concerned,"" said John F. Sommer Jr., the executive director. ""However we are not going to give up the fight. Vietnam has not cooperated by a long shot.""  Defying the intense lobbying by these groups, the Senate approved a resolution that said Vietnam's cooperation has increased significantly over the last three years in resolving the cases of missing Americans. The resolution also noted that senior American military officials feel that lifting the embargo will accelerate efforts to account for prisoners or war and missing servicemen.  Republicans in the Senate split almost evenly on the vote, with some convinced that Vietnam was making strenuous efforts to provide information on missing servicemen. Other Republicans appeared ready to use lifting the embargo as political ammunition against the Democrats.  Complaints From Businesses  Many companies have quietly told Republicans and Democrats that the embargo is hurting American business as Vietnam opens its economy to the outside world.  Senator Robert C. Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who has been a strong opponent of lifting the embargo, said today: ""We should not reward Vietnam with improved relations until we know they have unilaterally provided all the documentation they can from their archives. At this time, they have not even come close.""  Demonstrating how emotional the issue is, he called today's vote ""immoral and incomprehensible.""  The bill's sponsors argued that Vietnam might stop cooperating if President Clinton did not lift the embargo.  'Incentives to Respond'  ""You cannot expect the Vietnamese to go on and on helping us forever and receiving nothing in return but the cold shoulder of two decades of wholesale embargo,"" Senator Kerry said. ""In the last two years, Vietnamese cooperation on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue has accelerated dramatically because we engaged them and because we offered them incentives to respond.""  Rejecting suggestions from some service families that supporting the resolution was unpatriotic, the bill's backers noted that the main sponsor, Mr. Kerry, was wounded three times in Vietnam and was awarded a Silver Star and a Bronze Star; the other principal sponsor, Mr. McCain, was a P.O.W. Another sponsor was Senator Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat and Medal of Honor winner who lost his right leg below the knee in Vietnam.  Senator Kerry and Administration officials vigorously denied that the Administration had stage-managed today's vote with the aim of clearing the President's way to lift the embargo.  Links to White House  Administration officials and supporters of today's resolution said Senator Kerry was in regular contact with the White House's political staff on the resolution. A senior White House official said President Clinton had not sought to dissuade Senator Kerry when he told them he planned to bring the matter to a vote. But he said the White House had nothing to do with initiating the gambit.  Senator McCain said, ""The White House staff felt it was very important to pass this, given the problems that the President's lack of military background gives him on this sort of an issue.""  Today's resolution also sought to press Vietnam by stating that as Washington and Hanoi move toward normalizing relations, Vietnam should ""demonstrate further improvements in meeting internationally recognized standards of human rights.""  The resolution was proposed as an amendment to the State Department authorization bill.  In defending today's resolution, Senator McCain said he was relying on the view of two well-positioned military officials -- Adm. Charles R. Larson, Commander of United States forces in the Pacific, forces, and Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Mr. Clinton's envoy to Vietnam.  Mr. McCain said they believed that ""lifting the embargo will enhance their ability to make progress on the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue.""  Senator Kerry noted that the Vietnamese have turned over 67 sets of remains last year -- the most since the war ended in 1975. He also noted that investigators have been given access to Vietnamese archives.  ""The time has come for us to replace the hostility and mistrust of the last 19 years with reconciliation and reconstruction,"" Senator Kerry said.  Supporters of the embargo argued today that removing it would leave no levers to press Hanoi to continue cooperating. But Senators Kerry and McCain argued that there are many ways to press Hanoi, like continuing to withhold diplomatic relations or threatening to restore the embargo.  Last year, the Administration took several steps toward improving relations with Vietnam. In July, it gave the green light for the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions to lend money to Vietnam. In September, it began allowing United States companies to bid for contracts financed by loans from the I.M.F. and other international organizations.

"    This week the Senate staged a pre-emptive strike -- a 62-to-38 non-binding vote urging an early end to America's long economic embargo against Hanoi. The senators deserve praise for taking another step back from the bitterness of that war.  Vietnam is now giving all the cooperation Washington has asked for in the search for information about Americans lost in the Indochina wars. That deserves official recognition. And flooding Vietnam with U.S. businessmen may be the best way to flush out further information on the few remaining cases.  The bipartisan Senate effort was led by two Vietnam veterans -- John Kerry, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican -- with White House encouragement. The Clinton Administration concluded last month that Hanoi's actions justified lifting the embargo. But, sensitive to President Clinton's own avoidance of military service, it first checked the political waters. Thursday's Senate vote should have provided all the encouragement needed.  Opponents of economic ties cite human rights problems concerning Vietnamese citizens, ambiguous evidence of past deception on U.S. prisoners and the less than 100 remaining ""discrepancy cases"" involving Americans who may have survived capture but never returned.  The Administration responds that other forms of leverage, like diplomatic recognition, can be used on human rights; that allegations of deception concern long-ago events and are not sustained by hard evidence; and that while every discrepancy case needs to be aggressively pursued, Vietnamese cooperation has brought the remainder down to a very low number compared with other wars.  Those arguments will never persuade some Americans still angered by the loss of a loved one, humiliated by the outcome of the war or otherwise embittered against Hanoi. But many Americans personally touched by the Vietnam debacle, like Senators Kerry and McCain, have wisely concluded that it is time to let go of the past. Few Americans have any quarrel with the Vietnamese people; and Vietnam's Government is moving toward many goals Americans would approve of, including a market economy. It is no longer in America's best interest to isolate Vietnam. May the White House now quickly proceed to order an end to an outdated and pointless embargo.

"    To the Editor:  In ""Tie Vietnam Status to Rights Reform"" (letter, Jan. 15), Viet D. Dinh is right to cite Hanoi's abuse of the human rights of its citizens in answer to your Jan. 6 editorial call for lifting the United States economic embargo against Vietnam. But to say that Buddhism is persecuted goes, I believe, beyond the evidence. The state's attack is against those Buddhists who want a church independent of state control.  However, Mr. Dinh is wrong to state that Hanoi is ""desperate to have the embargo lifted."" All of our major capitalist rivals, with the addition of Australia, have not only unencumbered trade and investment with Vietnam, but full diplomatic relations as well. Small and medium-size high-tech products of the United States are readily smuggled into Vietnam by Asian middlemen.  If the United States adhered to Viet Dinh's excellent standards of human rights, we would never have had relations with the Soviet Union or with South Africa, and would not now have them with China.  We need full diplomatic relations with Vietnam to show Hanoi that we have truly ended our war against the Vietnamese. It is only when we make peace with Hanoi, and guarantee respect for Vietnam's territorial integrity, that we gain the right seriously and properly to pursue human rights issues with the Vietnamese.  One surely hopes that once United States recognition is established, we can then present a united diplomatic front of democratic states for human rights.  I regret, however, that Viet Dinh was not able to mention problems affecting Christians and the highland ethnic minorities of Vietnam.  The Southern highland peoples, with their increasing attraction to Christianity, suffer thrice over, as cultural-linguistic minorities. Christians, and those who, in considerable part, resisted the Communist takeover after 1975. (In the 1960's, they fought the Saigon regime for independence and, later, autonomy.)  No outside church groups or international human rights agencies have been permitted extensive contact with these Deqa peoples since 1975. Hanoi acknowledges that there have been serious ecological and economic problems in the highland regions, as lowland, ethnic Vietnamese have been settled there, and Northern highlanders were encouraged to move to some Southern upland areas.  Plans being made for the enormous Ta Bu Dam threaten the Thai speakers and other peoples in northwest Vietnam.

"      As the Clinton Administration moves toward lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam, it is still embroiled in a dispute over the most emotionally wrenching issue in the debate: whether Hanoi has done enough to return the remains of Americans missing from a war that ended nearly 20 years ago.  At issue in particular are 67 sets of remains that Vietnam has turned over to the United States, an act that won high marks from Administration officials.  ""That's the third highest number since the war ended two decades ago -- that shows real cooperation,"" said a senior Administration official who monitors the issue. But veterans groups insist not only that Vietnam continues to withhold many remains but also that many of the remains that have been returned might not even be those of Americans. The groups even assert that some of the remains might belong to Vietnamese soldiers or animals.  President Clinton has repeatedly said that he will end the trade embargo only after Vietnam cooperates in giving the fullest possible accounting of the fate of more than 2,200 American missing from the Vietnam War. Indeed, several senators praised Hanoi's cooperation in the debate before the Senate voted, 62 to 38, on Thursday to urge an end to the embargo.  The resolution, which is nonbinding, now awaits a decision by Mr. Clinton, White House officials say.  Top Administration officials decided last month that the embargo should be lifted, but held off on deciding when to do so as they sought to protect themselves from any political backlash. That need for political support was the impetus for the Senate resolution, but Administration officials have said they hope to win over the veterans groups and families of missing Americans -- or at least soften their opposition -- before going ahead.  Dolores Apodaca Alfond, chairwoman of the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, asserted in an interview on Saturday that the Administration was exaggerating the extent of Vietnam's cooperation because it was eager to end the embargo to help American business.  ""Only 3 sets of the 67 remains have been positively identified,"" said Ms. Alfond, the sister of a missing serviceman. ""When the Administration says: 'We have 67 sets of remains. Isn't that wonderful?' they're embellishing the truth. The Vietnamese are absolutely not cooperating as much as they can.""  She put little stock in the identification process, saying that when the Pentagon sent her family a package containing what were said to be her brother's remains, it contained some animal bones.  A spokesman at the Pentagon's Central Identification Laboratory, which is responsible for identifying the remains, noted that its anthropologists and other experts were able to distinguish between the bones of Americans and those of Vietnamese and that they could easily tell the difference between human bones and animal bones.  It usually takes one to four years to make a positive identification of remains once the United States receives them, say Administration officials, who add that focusing on the three positively identified sets of remains underestimates the recent progress.  The spokesman confirmed in a telephone interview in Hawaii that of the 67 sets of remains received last year, 3 have been positively identified and returned to the next of kin. The spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, said the laboratory and a board of consultants had made provisional identifications on 9 more sets of remains and were waiting for a final review in the identification process.  In addition, he said, the laboratory has made recommendations on identifications for 25 sets of other remains, a step that is just beginning to wind its way through the review process. Since the Vietnam War ended two decades ago, Pentagon officials have made positive identifications of 345 sets of remains.  ""We feel pretty confident that there will be an identification on these,"" the spokesman said. ""But the other 30 sets of remains are indeterminate. It's a meticulous, very scientific process.""  In identifying remains, the laboratory relies on things that include dental records, DNA samples and records of crash sites and of where American servicemen were last seen.  Some Groups Unpersuaded  But despite the laboratory's work and expertise, many veterans groups remain underwhelmed by the results. In an interview today, John F. Sommer Jr., executive director of the American Legion, said: ""They've been saying what a great year 1993 was. But they have only identified 3 of the remains. So how can they call this great progress.""  Some supporters of lifting the embargo acknowledge that Vietnam is probably withholding some incriminating documents and remains -- perhaps those of some American prisoners of war who were executed two decades ago. These people say that Hanoi will not turn over these remains now out of fear that this may spoil its chances of getting the embargo lifted.

"   , Thailand, Feb. 2   Welcoming reports that the 19-year-old United States trade embargo against Vietnam is nearly over, Hanoi joined with American businesses today in predicting a surge of new investment in a nation that is growing rapidly economically but still suffering from the effects of the Vietnam War.  In Hanoi, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said it had not received any formal notification from Washington, but the Government's chief spokesman said in a statement that the lifting of the trade embargo would be ""good news not only for the two peoples -- the Vietnamese and the Americans -- but also for the world community.""  ""We welcome American companies and companies from all countries that want to do business and invest in Vietnam,"" the spokesman, Ho The Lan, said.  Reports that President Clinton would lift the embargo within the next few days circulated quickly in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, with Vietnam Government officials and the representatives of American corporations sharing faxes and telexes carrying the latest news and rumors from Washington.  The reaction to the reports from American businesses was one of relief that they would finally be able to enter one of the world's fastest-growing markets, one that their Asian and European competitors have been able to exploit for years.  As Communism was collapsing in Eastern Europe in the late 1980's, Hanoi abandoned Marxist economic theory and embraced the free market. Although Vietnam is still regarded as a poor country, the economy has enjoyed something of a boom since the economic switch, growing last year alone by 8 percent.  ""This will be an excellent development for the United States and for Vietnam,"" said James Rockwell, managing director of Vatico, a Hanoi-based consulting concern that represents the Chrysler Corporation and other large American companies who are expected to seek a market in Vietnam.  ""The timing is good,"" Mr. Rockwell said. ""The Vietnamese like and respect Americans. I don't know why. It's just a fact. They see us as fair and trustworthy and they want to do business with us. But if the embargo had gone on another six months to a year, there would have been trouble. Americans would have been very, very small players in Vietnam.""  The Hanoi representative of Citibank, Frank Hawke, said that while some American investors seemed to believe that they had already ""missed the boat"" because so many competitors had already moved into Vietnam, the truth is that ""there are lots of boats out there -- some of them missed, some of them not.""  ""The Vietnamese are emphasizing key infrastructure areas such as petrochemicals, telecommunications, transportation and power generation, all areas where U.S. companies excel,"" Mr. Hawke said.  Embargo Began in 1975  The United States imposed an economic embargo on Vietnam in 1975, when the American-backed Government of South Vietnam was toppled by the invading North Vietnamese Army. Washington has since used the embargo as a way of persuading the Vietnamese to cooperate in the effort to determine the fate of more than 2,200 Americans missing from the war.  As Hanoi has expanded its cooperation to account for the missing, the United States has gradually eased the embargo, most recently last July, when President Clinton lifted an American veto that had blocked billions of dollars in loans and aid from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  While American corporations are now allowed to open offices in Vietnam and to bid on large infrastructure projects underwritten by the World Bank and the I.M.F., they are still barred under the embargo from selling their products in Vietnam and from conducting other types of business.  The many American products that do reach the Vietnamese market -- from Coca-Cola to Apple Computers to American Tourister luggage -- are sent in by foreign middlemen who rake off profits that would otherwise go to American manufacturers.

"      For some, the announcement of economic coexistence with Vietnam was greeted with a sense that, finally, peace was at hand. For others, it seemed a final betrayal by the Government.  Bitterly denouncing the President's decision were some former prisoners of war and those who believe American troops listed as missing in action may still be alive. They said any accommodation with Vietnam would be wrong until a final accounting.  ""All of us who were held as P.O.W.'s in Vietnam know first-hand that there are no limits to what the Vietnamese will do to show they are 'cooperating' with the United States to account for our missing comrades,"" a group of 70 former prisoners of war, including James B. Stockdale, a retired Navy admiral and Ross Perot's running mate in the 1992 election, said in a letter sent to President Clinton today.  In a fierce attack, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, called the embargo's end ""the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reason.""  U.S. Can 'Move Forward'  Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat and a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, said the decision ""guarantees we keep faith with the veterans and families but that we continue to move forward.""  ""We have the most exhaustive, painstaking accounting in place in the history of warfare and I think we ought to be proud of that,"" Mr. Kerry added.  Addressing the disbelief and anger among the families of the missing, Senator Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who lost a leg in Vietnam, said there had been ""a great deal of lying on everybody's part in the 1970's. The families of the P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s are anguished because the government hadn't told them the truth. Now the Government is telling them the truth.""  Senator Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican and Vietnam veteran, simply said, ""The Vietnam War is finally over.""  'A Few Pieces of Silver""  For some families of the missing, ""President Clinton has sold the morality of the American people for just a few pieces of silver by lifting the trade embargo and abandoned the leverage we had for gaining information on our loved ones,"" said Dolores Apodaca Alfond, who leads the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen, based in Seattle.  But for another set of families, Vietnamese who came to America seeking freedom and whose families remain there, the end of the embargo offered the hope of long-awaited reunions.  ""It's time, you know -- there is no way to avoid it,"" said Thiep Le, who fled Vietnam in 1979 and is now a restaurateur in suburban Washington.  'Easier to Breathe' in Vietnam  ""Depending on whether the Vietnamese Government can exploit the opportunity positively, it will be a little bit easier to breathe for the ordinary people in Vietnam . If normalization is coming in the near future, people can go back and forth from here to Vietnam. My mother is still there, my sister's still there, but I've dared not to go back. In a few years, I can hope to go and come back safely.""  Truyen Swinger, a Vietnamese woman married to an American doctor, said the decision made her ""really happy"" and gave substance to her dreams of starting a business in her homeland. ""I'm thinking of opening a sewing factory in Vietnam,"" said Ms. Swinger, who runs a New York clothing design and manufacturing firm.  For Mimi Tran, one of four sisters who run Cuisine de Saigon at 154 West 13th Street in Manhattan, ""there's a sad side, but there's a happy side, too"" in the decision.  ""There are lots of people who are stranded in the refugee camps in the Philippines -- I don't think they can gain entrance to the U.S. anymore,"" said Ms. Tran, who is 35 years old and came to the United States in 1968. ""The happy side is we hope we're able to travel freely.""  There is no such happiness for the groups demanding a final accounting of those missing in Vietnam -- and in Laos and Cambodia, where the United States conducted secret missions to root out Communist forces. They have found it hard to accept the official Government position that much has been accomplished and not much more can be done to trace those who disappeared in the war. Many of the groups contend that some of the missing are still alive, but White House and Pentagon officials say no credible evidence supports that belief.  'A Growing Cooperation'  Noting that 78,000 soldiers remain listed as missing in action from World War II, Senator John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, said Vietnam has shown ""a growing cooperation"" on the issue in recent years and has granted American military emissaries ""complete access to go anywhere in Vietnam"" in order to bring the number of unresolved cases down to a few hundred.  Official United States figures list 1,647 servicemen missing in Vietnam and a total of 2,238 unaccounted for in various areas of Southeast Asia. An additional 505 remain unaccounted for in Laos, 78 in Cambodia and 8 in China. The remains of 344 Americans have been returned and identified since the war, leaving 1,894 cases unresolved.  Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and former Navy flier who was a prisoner of war for more than five years, called again for a continuing efforts to trace those lost troops and added: ""Beyond even that most important priority, the President has decided today to move the nation toward closure of a chapter in our history that has divided us for too long. I commend him for that decision, as would my comrades who did not come home.""  LOAD-DATE: February 4, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 4 1994 ,11
"      Following are excerpts from President Clinton's announcement today that he was lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private company:  From the beginning of my Administration, I have said that any decisions about our relationships with Vietnam should be guided by one factor and one factor only -- gaining the fullest possible accounting for our prisoners of war and our missing in action. We owe that to all who served in Vietnam and to the families of those whose fate remains unknown.  Today I am lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam because I am absolutely convinced it offers the best way to resolve the fate of those who remain missing and about whom we are not sure.  We've worked hard over the last year to achieve progress. On Memorial Day, I pledged to declassify and make available virtually all government documents related to our P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s. On Veterans Day, I announced that we had fulfilled that pledge.  Last April, and again in July, I sent two presidential delegations to Vietnam to expand our search for remains and documents. We intensified our diplomatic efforts. We have devoted more resources to this effort than any previous Administration. Today more than 500 dedicated military and civilian personnel are involved in this effort under the leadership of General Shalikashvili, Secretary Aspin, and our commander in the Pacific, Admiral Larson. Many worked daily in the fields, the jungles, the mountains of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, often braving very dangerous conditions, trying to find the truth about those about whom we are not sure.  Four Areas of Progress  Last July, I said any improvement in our relations with Vietnam would depend on tangible progress in four specific areas: first, the recovery and return of remains of our P.O.W.s and M.I.A.'s; second, the continued resolution of discrepancy cases, cases in which there is reason to believe individuals could have survived the incident in which they were lost; third, further assistance from Vietnam and Laos on investigations along their common border, an area where many U.S. servicemen were lost and pilots downed; and fourth, accelerated efforts to provide all relevant P.O.W.-M.I.A.-related documents. Today I can report that significant tangible progress has been made in all these four areas.                                      .  .  .  First, on remains. Since the beginning of this Administration, we have recovered the remains of 67 American servicemen. In the seven months since July, we've recovered 39 sets of remains, more than during all of 1992.  Second, on the discrepancy cases. Since the beginning of the Administration, we've reduced the number of these cases from 135 to 73. Since last July, we've confirmed the deaths of 19 servicemen who were on the list. A special United States team in Vietnam continues to investigate the remaining cases.  Third, on cooperation with Laos. As a direct result of the conditions set out in July, the Governments of Vietnam and Laos agreed to work with us to investigate their common border. The first such investigation took place in December and located new remains as well as crash sites that will soon be excavated.  Fourth, on the documents. Since July we have received important wartime documents from Vietnam's military archives that provide leads on unresolved P.O.W.-M.I.A. cases.  Continuing the Search  The progress achieved on unresolved questions is encouraging, but it must not end here. I remain personally committed to continuing the search for the answers and the peace of mind that the families of the missing deserve. There's been a substantial increase in Vietnamese cooperation on these matters over the past year. Everyone involved in the issue has affirmed that.  I have carefully considered the question of how best to sustain that cooperation in securing the fullest possible accounting. I've consulted with my national security and veterans' affairs advisers, with several outside experts such as Gen. John Vessey, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has been an emissary to Vietnam for three Presidents now. It was their view that the key to continued progress lies in expanding our contacts with Vietnam. This was also the view of many distinguished Vietnam veterans and former P.O.W.'s.                                      .  .  .  I have made the judgment that the best way to insure cooperation from Vietnam and to continue getting the information Americans want on P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s is to end the trade embargo. I've also decided to establish a liaison office in Vietnam to provide services for Americans there and help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government.  I want to be clear: These actions do not constitute a normalization of our relationships. Before that happens, we must have more progress, more cooperation, and more answers. Toward that end, this spring I will send another high-level U.S. delegation to Vietnam to continue the search for remains and for documents.  Earlier today, I met with the leaders of our nation's veterans organizations. I deeply respect their views.                                      .  .  .  I talked with them about my decision, and I explained the reasons for that decision. Some of them, in all candor, do not agree with the action I am taking today, but I believe we all agree on the ultimate goal: to secure the fullest possible accounting of those who remain missing. And I was pleased that they committed to continue working with us toward that goal.  Whatever the Vietnam War may have done in dividing our country in the past, today our nation is one in honoring those who served and pressing for answers about all those who did not return. This decision today, I believe, renews that commitment and our constant, constant effort never to forget those until our job is done.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Feb. 4   In the crowded streets of a city still better known to the world as Saigon, there was a sense today that the war was finally over, the last battle concluded half a world away in the corridors of the White House.  The news that President Clinton had decided to lift the American trade embargo against Vietnam reached here today shortly before dawn, and by breakfast it was the only topic of conversation to be found in much of Ho Chi Minh City, the city that the Americans had to flee in humiliation a generation ago.  ""A heavy burden has been lifted,"" said Lam Thanh Sy, a 38-year-old high school mathematics teacher who recalls the boyhood terror of rushing into a bomb shelter with his parents. ""We in Vietnam have felt that we were not allowed to participate in the world as full citizens because of the embargo. Now at last we are allowed to forget the war.""  A Matter of Perspective  He was standing in the shadow of a large statue of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese revolutionary leader, in a small, well-tended public park near city hall. A few feet away, a photographer, Hoang Hon Thanh, was snapping pictures of happy families posed beneath the statue.  ""Me? I'm happy too,"" he said. ""And I'm happy for a simple reason. Five years ago, I bought a Polaroid. Now that the embargo is lifted, I can finally buy some film for it.""  The Vietnamese Government said in a statement released in Hanoi today that it was thankful to President Clinton for his decision to lift the embargo. The statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai pledged Vietnam's continued cooperation in determining the fate of 2,200 Americans still missing from the Vietnam War, the issue most often cited by the United States in keeping the trade embargo in place for so long.  ""This decision meets the desire of the American and the Vietnamese peoples,"" Mr. Mai said, praising the President for having opened ""a new page in U.S.-Vietnam relations."" He called on Washington to consider establishing full diplomatic relations with Vietnam.  Fast-Growing Market  American corporations have been planning for years for the moment when they would be allowed back into Vietnam, a market of nearly 71 million consumers that even with the American embargo in place has emerged as one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic in Asia.  And so only hours after they heard the announcement from Washington, Americans began marching back onto the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, this time armed with checkbooks and marketing plans and wearing suits and ties.  Vietnam remains one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita annual income of less than $500, but economists agree that with its diligent, well-educated work force and untapped natural resources, Vietnam has the potential to catch up with its booming Southeast Asian neighbors.  In a country where smuggled Coca-Cola is the most popular drink, Pepsi was the first to act. This morning, Pepsi began legitimate distribution for the first time since the 1970's, handing out bottles free to passers-by. This weekend, Pepsi says, television viewers here will see a new commercial featuring Miss Vietnam, 18-year-old Ha Kieu Anh, one of Vietnam's most popular celebrities.  Other American companies were not far behind in the battle to make their presence felt here. Coca-Cola announced that it would spend $45 million in Vietnam over the next five years. American Express said that Vietnam's foreign trade bank had agreed to accept the American Express charge card, making it the first American card to return to Vietnam since 1975. United Airlines reported here that it would soon begin service to Ho Chi Minh City from Los Angeles under a route authority it purchased in 1986 but, because of the embargo, had not been able to use.  In the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, many Vietnamese reacted to the lifting of the embargo with a sort of giddy excitement. There was for some the thought of renewing ties to an old, prosperous friend, the United States.  ""My mother told me that when the American soldiers were here, there was lots of candy and many television sets and nice cars,"" said Tran, the 8-year-old son of a factory worker. ""I think it will be fun to have the Americans here.""  The end of the American embargo only made worse the usual crush today at the international airport in Ho Chi Minh City, once the American-run Tan Son Nhut Air Base.  Anxious to Return  Nineteen years after they joined the panicked evacuation out of what was then Saigon, large American corporations were struggling today to get their salesmen and marketing executives on the first flights heading back into the city.  John R. Guy, director of international sales at Briggs & Stratton Corporation, a Milwaukee-based manufacturer of gasoline engines, arrived in Ho Chi Minh City on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, and went immediately to work. He is here to search for a Vietnamese partner.  His enthusiasm about his first trip to Vietnam was tempered by worries about his competitors, Asian and European manufacturers that were not hobbled by the American embargo. Some have been at work in Vietnam for years. ""All of my major competitors are Japanese,"" he said. ""And they are already in Vietnam.""  Can Briggs & Stratton hope to catch up with the Japanese? ""It's my job to make sure that we can,"" Mr. Guy said with some confidence. ""This isn't impossible."" Briggs & Stratton, he said, thinks that Vietnam could become the company's major Asian market within four years.

"   , Vietnam, Feb. 4   Government officials welcomed President Clinton's lifting of the United States trade embargo on Vietnam in measured terms today.  But even though this capital, unlike Ho Chi Minh City in the south, has never known what it is like to have the United States as a trading partner, many ordinary Vietnamese here greeted the American action as a significant boost to the festive mood building up for Tet, the lunar new year holiday beginning on Thursday.  In a news conference punctuated by bursts of exploding Tet firecrackers in the surrounding streets, Deputy Foreign Minister Mai voiced the Government's satisfaction at the lifting of the ban. But Mr. Mai, one of the principal architects of Vietnamese-American reconciliation, took pains not to jubilate. Asked about his personal feelings about the end of the embargo, he replied: ""I think that Vietnamese matters have created many emotional issues in the United States. We, the Vietnamese, are less emotional.""  ""I think the lifting of the trade embargo may bring about many new things, or maybe very few new things, or maybe nothing new,"" the Deputy Foreign Minister said, and he indicated Vietnam's irritation at Mr. Clinton's remark, in announcing the end of the ban, that his action was ""reversible.""  ""No nation in the world,"" Mr. Mai said, ""has the right to impose a trade embargo on another nation or to threaten to reimpose an embargo.""  Pledged Cooperation  But in comments obviously designed for concord with Mr. Clinton's emphasis -- that he lifted the embargo for the sake of advancing the search for evidence of the 2,238 Americans still officially listed as missing in action -- Mr. Mai pledged Vietnam's full cooperation.  ""We will continue to cooperate fully with the United States under any political circumstances,"" he said. ""The Vietnamese people have themselves suffered sorrow and grief and share the concern of American families whose loved ones are still listed as missing from the war.""  In a conversation before the lifting of the embargo was announced, Mr. Mai said on Thursday that many Vietnamese held unrealistic hopes for quick economic changes once trade with America became possible.  Fear of Inflation  Indeed, a staff member at the History Museum voiced caution today that the end of the embargo might bring such an inflationary economic boom that the low wages of civil servants might not keep up with a rise in prices. Most Government employees earn no more than $30 a month.  But she also saw the value of the broadening of Vietnam's relations to include the world's leading power. ""It will protect us against invasion from the north,"" said the woman, a combat veteran of the war in South Vietnam. Her fear of China is widely shared throughout this nation.  Tu Giay, founder and former chief of the National Institute of Nutrition, a 73-year-old veteran of the war against France and a longtime Communist, was philosophically Buddhist in welcoming the end of the embargo.  ""We come into the world only once,"" he said. ""We don't know when we can come back, because we must die before we can return. Why spend this short life quarreling? So the event is a happy one -- but a little late.""  LOAD-DATE: February 5, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 5 1994 ,11
"    President Clinton did the right thing for the United States this week in ending the 19-year-old ban on Americans' doing business with Vietnam. For Mr. Clinton, it was an act of political courage. Had his predecessors been able to take a larger view of American interests, they would have lifted the embargo years ago.  Vietnam has been changing dramatically for nearly a decade. Most of the differences that drove Hanoi and Washington to war in the 1960's and 1970's and kept them at odds through the early 1980's have disappeared.  In fact, almost all have been resolved in America's favor. Vietnam's troops are out of Cambodia. Its markets are open to the world. And it has turned away from what remains of the Communist bloc to seek new links with the Association of South East Asian Nations, formed during the Vietnam War as an anti-Communist bloc.  Vietnam is still a one-party state with an appalling human rights record, but so are some of America's best friends and trading partners in Southeast Asia. What has kept Washington at arm's length from the new Vietnam is, of course, the legacy of an old war.  Only a small part of that legacy was substantive. While every single case of a soldier lost without remains or information is a family tragedy, the number of Americans still unaccounted for is unusually small given the scope and duration of American involvement.  The war's larger legacy has been political and psychological. The dead and the missing were not, as in past wars, redeemed by an American military victory. For many Americans this was humiliating; for some, even dishonorable. Refusing to acknowledge Hanoi meant refusing to certify Washington's defeat. As the years passed, and Vietnam found the trade and aid it needed elsewhere, making the embargo pointless, only a minority remained irreconcilable. But successive Republican Presidents indulged this minority, while successive Democrats feared provoking them.  It is thus remarkable that Bill Clinton, whose own opposition to the war and avoidance of the draft made him especially vulnerable to attack on this issue, became the President who finally recognized reality and acted in the national interest.  Hanoi made it easier for him with its vastly improved cooperation in recent years on searching for remains of missing Americans. So did American business leaders clamoring for a share of the growing economic action before European and Asian countries locked any more of it up for themselves. And Mr. Clinton has prudently held back on such steps as diplomatic recognition and special trade and aid agreements, holding them out as inducements for further Vietnamese cooperation and human rights progress.  But give this President the full credit he deserves, for at last ending America's self-imposed, self-punishing exile from the new Vietnam.

"      It will surprise many people with whom I have worked on behalf of missing servicemen from the Vietnam War that I applaud President Clinton's decision to lift trade sanctions against Vietnam. The veterans' groups that have criticized the President should be aware that commencing trade with Vietnam can help the P.O.W./M.I.A. cause. Yesterday's announcement that Hanoi will release the remains of additional American soldiers is a promising first step.  In July 1993, Mr. Clinton indicated four areas in which Vietnamese assistance in the search for missing Americans was needed. An intensive diplomatic effort, with Vietnamese cooperation, has achieved significant progress in all four:  * Remains. Last year, the remains of 67 servicemen came home. This was the third highest total in any year since the war's end.  * Discrepancies. The military has calculated that 196 servicemen were known to be alive after the incidents leading to their disappearance. In 1993, 82 of those unknown cases were confirmed to have died. Hundreds of reported sightings of live American prisoners have been investigated on the ground in Vietnam since 1991, but none have produced evidence that Americans are captive today.  * Vietnamese documents. For the first time, we have received records from Vietnamese anti-aircraft units that were posted along the Ho Chi Minh trail, from a key wartime military-political unit and from Hanoi's postwar investigations to locate Americans' remains. At least 24,000 documents and artifacts, more than had been received in the entire postwar period, were released.  * Cooperation with Laos. In August, the Vietnamese and the Laotians agreed to U.S. requests for trilateral investigations along their border and the Ho Chi Minh trail. The first operation, in December, located some remains and several crash sites to be excavated in coming months.  Although Vietnamese officials have been very helpful, there are thousands of acres still to be examined and many potential witnesses still to be identified. Lifting the embargo will make it possible for Americans to scour the country and talk to civilians in villages and rural areas.  The President should make sure that the relatives of those missing in action have access to all the locations they need to explore. Then they will see for themselves how helpful the Vietnamese people are being. In addition, having an official U.S. diplomatic presence in Vietnam will be of great help to the effort.  I lost a son as a result of his exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam. As a parent and a wartime commander, I know the anguish these families feel. They need to know what happened to their loved ones, or at least that all that can be done has been done. This can happen only if we put aside bitterness and revenge, lift the trade sanctions, recognize the Government and begin the peaceful penetration of Vietnam.

"   , Vietnam, Feb. 7   The Defense Department official in Vietnam leading the investigation of the fate of Americans missing from the Vietnam War predicted today that President Clinton's decision to lift the 19-year-old trade embargo on Vietnam would result in greater cooperation from Hanoi.  The investigator, Lieut. Col. John C. Cray, made the comments after attending a somber ceremony at Noi Bai International Airport here to watch Vietnamese officials turn over what are believed to be the remains of at least 12 Americans who died in the war.  ""We're at a peak in terms of cooperation from Vietnam,"" Colonel Cray said in an interview. ""They have made a decision -- and they had made it in the past year, year and a half -- to cooperate with us. We have every indication that the cooperation will continue.""  ""Some people have said it will diminish the cooperation,"" he said of the lifting of the embargo. ""But I don't think so. I think it's going to enhance it.""  He said the Vietnamese must continue to cooperate because ""the world is watching them -- the families are watching, veterans groups are watching, we are watching.""  The Administration has come under criticism from some veterans' groups and the families of missing Americans over Mr. Clinton's decision last week to lift the trade embargo. The embargo was imposed after the North Vietnamese Army toppled the Government of South Vietnam in 1975.  Veterans groups and some families have asserted that by lifting the embargo, the President has lost his leverage to force Vietnam to cooperate in the search for the 2,238 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina.  ""I think the President still has leverage,"" said Colonel Cray, who is based in Hanoi as commander of the Pentagon's Joint Task Force for Full Accounting. ""What I would tell the family members is that the people who are working this issue are extremely committed, that they are doing the best they can, and that their qualifications are tremendous. We're servicemen searching for servicemen.""  Defense Department officials said that the airport ceremony today was planned weeks before Mr. Clinton's announcement on the embargo, and that the timing was a coincidence.  Still, the dawning of a new relationship between the two former enemies gives special significance to today's ceremony, in which Vietnamese officials presented the United States with 13 small wooden boxes that, Pentagon investigators believe, contain the bones, bone fragments and teeth of at least 12 Americans who died in the war.  Sixty-seven sets of remains were given to the United States last year.  In a ritual repeated many times in recent years, each of the boxes was opened this morning on the warm, windswept tarmac for a final inspection by Vietnamese and American officials before they were nailed shut.  A team of white-gloved American servicemen representing all four branches of the military gently lifted each of the boxes into its own sealed aluminum container. After American flags were placed on the containers, they were taken aboard an American C-141 transport plane for a flight to Hawaii, where military forensic pathologists will try to identify the remains, a process that can take years.  The Defense Department opened an office in Hanoi in 1991 to oversee its search for Americans missing from the war, and early on American investigators complained about the level of cooperation that they received from the Vietnamese.  But Colonel Cray and other American investigators said today that there had been a notable improvement in Hanoi's attitude, and that the new spirit of cooperation had eliminated many of the logistical headaches and delays faced in the early stages of the search.  In the last year, Colonel Cray said, the Vietnamese agreed to make available several Vietnamese Army generals for interviews about their knowledge of the fate of American prisoners of war. In some cases, he said, the interviews had provided the Defense Department with valuable information about the location of prisoner camps where Americans may have died.

"    To the Editor:  There is something disheartening and humiliating about the way the United States is sidling into normal relations with Vietnam (front page, Feb. 4). This is not the way a strong and confident republic behaves.  Our Government is tiptoeing toward ending the embargo on dealings with the people who drove us out of their land 19 years ago. We seem to be doing it, at last, mainly for commercial reasons (Japanese businessmen may be doing too well there), not because it's the right thing to do, morally and practically.  The excuse for so many years of this ungraceful posture is that our former ""enemy"" was not doing enough to help us find the remains of Americans still listed as missing in action.  A few facts for those who have chosen to forget that ugly war:  * The Pentagon now lists about 2,000 as unaccounted for (70 to 90 cases still need more investigation, the Pentagon says -- the rest are considered dead).  * From the Korean War in the early 1950's the missing in action number is about 8,000.  * The official number for missing in action in World War II is around 78,000 -- their commemoration is at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery.  So the accounting of the slaughter in Vietnam is not all that incomplete. And we might remember, with a wince, that the number of missing in action from the Vietnamese side is 100 times greater than from ours -- about 200,000.  The American search for the missing in action has been a grisly bureaucratic enterprise. In addition to the adventurous racketeers who have preyed on grieving families with faked photos and tales of prisoners still in jungle stockades, there have been endless high-level trips to Vietnam by officials and politicians seeking to get more help from the Vietnamese in the search for remains.  It is hard, especially in this nationalistic age, for a country to admit that it was wrong when it went to war. And we are not at all doing that as we edge toward normalizing relations with Vietnam. It is particularly difficult for President Clinton, with his (not discreditable) record of avoiding service in a war he opposed on principle, to make a semi-peace with the former foe.  So more credit to him for taking this half-step.  However, would it not have been better, more virtuous, if we had been able to do this without all the contortions of policy and rhetorical cant, compounded by commercial motives? Could we not have simply turned over this page of history, established normal diplomatic relations, and declared that the dreadful, mistaken Vietnam War was finally over?

"      Russian officials reportedly complained last November that State Department officials were discouraging them from releasing documents about prisoners of war in Vietnam. The report came in a classified cable made available today by Administration officials angry over President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam.  According to the cable, the Russians said they were receiving a mixed message from Washington: while many American officials were pressing them to turn over as many documents as possible about the missing, others were saying that releasing such documents would hurt relations.  Senior State Department officials vigorously denied today that Moscow had been told not to disclose documents and said they had repeatedly pressed the Russians to produce whatever documents they had.  Clinton's Policy  President Clinton said last year that he wanted the fullest possible accounting of the fate of more than 2,200 Americans missing in Indochina.  The officials who provided the classified cable expressed concern that it indicated that some State Department officials were flouting the President's policy in order to avoid disclosures from Soviet archives that could have delayed the lifting of the embargo.  The Administration's movement toward lifting the embargo stalled last spring with the discovery of a 1972 document, reportedly from Soviet archives, that suggested that Vietnam had held more prisoners than it had admitted.  President Clinton lifted the trade embargo on Feb. 3, saying that Hanoi had cooperated in providing a full accounting of the missing Americans.  Discrepancy in Numbers  The cable supplied today, which was dated Nov. 12, quoted a Russian official as saying that Foreign Ministry officials had been told by unnamed State Department officials that they ""were not pleased with"" the release of the 1972 document, which was said to be a translation of a Vietnamese document stating that Hanoi held 1,205 American prisoners of war.  The figure of 1,205 P.O.W.'s in that document, which was released in April, was far greater than the 591 prisoners that Vietnam released in 1973. The document included many factual inconsistencies, and the Pentagon concluded last month that it exaggerated the number of P.O.W.'s.  The Nov. 12 cable quoted the Russian official, Lieut. Col. Sergei N. Osipov, a liaison with American M.I.A. investigators in Moscow, as saying that the ministry had heard that State Department officials ""were discouraging further releases of such documents.""  The cable was sent by the American head of the Moscow office of an official Russian-American group that was seeking information about Americans missing from the Vietnam and Korean wars. The cable was sent under the name of Thomas R. Pickering, the United States Ambassador.  Mr. Pickering said today that he could not understand how the Russians had gotten a mixed message, because Washington had repeatedly asked for all relevant information.  Accusation of Collusion  Several Americans who used to work with the M.I.A. investigators in Moscow said the cable showed that some State Department officials were so eager to have the embargo lifted that they urged Moscow not to release documents that put Vietnam in a bad light.  Col. William LeGro, a retired former special assistant to the director of the investigation, said: ""Some officials were trying to convince the President that the Vietnamese had cooperated 100 percent in resolving the M.I.A. issue and that the embargo should be lifted. Therefore they said, 'We don't want any more of this incriminating evidence to become public.' ""  But the cable also suggested that some Russian officials ""were confusing stated policy with the reaction by individual officials to the untimely and inopportune release of documents and information to the press.""  And Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, angrily denied today that any State Department officials discouraged Moscow from releasing documents.  'Contrary to U.S. Policy'  ""No one in the State Department would say, 'We don't want documents,' "" said Mr. Lord. ""The reported position by the Russians of what some State Deparment people said is directly contrary to official United States policy. Anyone who would have said that would be fired.""  A person who attended a meeting in Moscow in October between Mr. Lord and Deputy Foreign Minister Georgi F. Kunadze said verbatim notes showed that Mr. Lord had urged the Russians to cooperate further.  State Department officials said a cable was sent to Moscow on Nov. 13 emphasizing that Washington wanted all relevant documents and protesting reports that Russia had agreed not to release files without consulting Hanoi.  One American official familiar with the contents of the cable said Colonel Osipov had been reluctant to release Vietnam-related documents and may have concocted the story that State Department officials had urged Moscow not to do so. Under this interpretation, Colonel Osipov was trying to ward off pressure to release documents that could embarrass Moscow. Some American intelligence officials say Colonel Osipov is a former K.G.B. agent.  Colonel Osipov did not return two calls to his office in Moscow.

"   , Vietnam, Feb. 18   Vietnam says it will open discussions this month with the United States on human rights and other issues with the goal of broadening their relationship. But an official warned that Hanoi will not accept interference in its internal affairs.  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, the chief architect of Vietnam's campaign for full diplomatic relations with Washington, said in an interview on Wednesday that an American negotiating team was expected in Hanoi by the end of the month to begin what he called ""technical"" discussions on issues like the status of official property seized by each country at the time of the Communist victory in 1975. Among those assets are the former United States Embassy in Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, and South Vietnamese bank accounts in the United States.  The talks will also focus on the establishment of official liaison offices here and in Washington. In lifting the American trade embargo against Vietnam on Feb. 3, President Clinton said he had decided to open a liaison office in Hanoi ""to provide services for Americans there and help us to pursue a human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government.""  An Embassy in All But Name  The Deputy Foreign Minister, whose name is often mentioned as a possible first Ambassador to Washington, made clear that Vietnam did not share that narrow concept of the liaison office.  Mr. Mai made clear that Vietnam wants the liaison offices to be embassies in all but name. ""The liaison office is an American idea,"" he said. ""We think it would be better if we could go faster. But if the United States wants to go step by step, we have to accept that.  ""Full diplomatic relations would be better,"" he said. ""There is no obstacle on the Vietnamese side. The problem is with United States domestic politics. We hope it will take a shorter time than the lifting of the embargo.""  ""When talking of human rights, Vietnam and other developing countries feel the United States considers itself as a model for the world, imposing its way of living and thinking on other nations,"" Mr. Mai said, speaking in English. ""They are always reminding the Vietnamese people they are dealing with a superior power. Sometimes we feel the United States doesn't treat us on an equal footing.""  No Political Conditions  At a briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman, Ho The Lan, emphasized that ""equality, mutual respect and noninterference in internal affairs"" must govern the human rights discussions. She said both countries had agreed that neither side should set political conditions for normalization.  Mrs. Lan repeated concerns expressed by Mr. Mai at a news conference after the lifting of the American trade embargo that the human rights issue might hinder progress. Mrs. Lan added: ""Vietnam and the United States understand that on the road to normalization there may or may not be obstacles. It depends on the good will of both sides.""  Though Washington acknowledges that repression has eased since aid from Moscow was cut off three years ago by the former Soviet Union, the United States still criticizes Vietnam's adherence to a one-party Communist system, its jailing of political opponents and its restrictions on activities of Buddhist and Roman Catholic clerics and on press freedom. Officials here say that they consider such criticism interference in their country's domestic affairs.  Mr. Mai said that Le Bang, Vietnam's representative at the United Nations, would also meet in New York late this month with State Department officials to pave the way for a future ""dialogue"" on human rights requested by the United States.  Missing Still an Issue  In lifting the embargo against Vietnam, Mr. Clinton emphasized Hanoi's cooperation with efforts to account for Americans who are missing from the Vietnam War, a sensitive issue that is also likely to complicate steps toward normalizing relations.  Mr. Mai said Vietnam was pleased that the United States Treasury Department had raised Vietnam to a category of nations with which Americans can conduct any financial transactions short of military sales. ""But I think that's enough for us,"" he said.  But the Deputy Foreign Minister said he regretted that the United States had not granted Vietnam most-favored-nation trading status, the most beneficial category of tariffs. He said high tariffs would make Vietnamese goods less competitive in the American market.  He expressed optimism nonetheless about business opportunities and, above all, tourism. In one or two years, Americans are likely to replace the French as the most frequent travelers to Vietnam, he predicted, reasoning that thousands of Americans who served in the war would like to visit.  As a result, Mr. Mai said, ""More Americans will see that Vietnam is a country, a people, not only a war.""

"   , Vietnam, Oct. 26   The commander of American military forces in the Pacific praised Vietnam today for its cooperation in accounting for American troops missing from the Vietnam War. He suggested that the Vietnamese would continue to cooperate enthusiastically regardless of whether Washington established full diplomatic and trade relations with Hanoi.  The comments here by Adm. Richard C. Macke delighted his Vietnamese hosts, who have long argued that the United States should not use the issue of missing Americans to delay normal diplomatic ties.  ""At all levels of the Government, I heard the desire to continue the cooperation and in fact to enhance that cooperation,"" Admiral Macke said after meeting with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and other Vietnamese officials. ""We are very pleased with the cooperation we see now. Overall the meetings with the Vietnamese were very encouraging.""  While the admiral cautioned that the decision to restore full diplomatic relations with Vietnam would be left to ""our political masters,"" his unqualified praise for the Vietnamese today will doubtless help Hanoi in its long campaign to establish normal ties with Washington.  ""I don't make that decision,"" said Admiral Macke, a Vietnam veteran. ""I know that we are working toward it.""  The Clinton Administration, which in February lifted a 19-year American trade embargo on Vietnam, has said the move toward normal diplomatic relations depends on ""tangible progress"" in accounting for the 2,214 Americans still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia.  Admiral Macke, on his first visit to Vietnam since assuming the Honolulu-based Pacific Command last summer, said today that tangible progress was being made with Vietnamese help. ""When we lifted the embargo, the cooperation in fact did not lessen -- the cooperation in fact continued to improve,"" he said.  Asked whether the military had any concern that the Vietnamese would cut back their cooperation if Washington took the next step and established full relations with Hanoi, the admiral replied, ""I personally don't have any concern there.""  When President Clinton lifted the embargo, a number of veterans groups and the families of some of the missing Americans warned that Vietnam would have no reason to continue cooperating in the effort to determine the fate of the missing.  They are using the same argument in urging the Administration to withhold full diplomatic and trade relations for the Vietnamese, who are especially eager for American trade privileges that would allow them to sell a wide variety of Vietnamese goods in the United States.  Admiral Macke, a former fighter pilot who flew more than 150 combat missions over Southeast Asia in the 1960's, met with reporters after visiting two sites in Vietnam where joint American and Vietnamese teams are searching for clues to the fate of missing Americans.  ""I was impressed by the tremendous cooperation, the working shoulder to shoulder between the Vietnamese townspeople and the Americans who are out there digging and excavating in those sites,"" he said. ""I saw that not only at the national level, but at the regional, at the province, at the district, at the village level, there was tremendous cooperation between the Americans and Vietnamese.""  The Pentagon maintains a staff of American investigators, working under Admiral Macke's command, at an office in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, to carry out searches in the countryside, an effort that is expected to continue for years.

"    To the Editor:  For more than 20 years the United States held accounting for its missing in action in the Vietnam War as a condition for resuming business in Vietnam -- as long as it took for us to acknowledge that the Vietnamese also lacked news of their M.I.A.'s.  So too, accounting for the 609 Kuwaitis missing since the Persian Gulf war has become a condition for lifting economic sanctions against Iraq. Must Iraqis suffer for 20 more years before the United States acknowledges the thousands of Iraqi M.I.A.'s? In war, the innocent suffer on both sides.  SUZY T.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Nov. 2   Nearly 20 years after the end of the war, there are still places in Vietnam that can make an American shudder. The battlefields of Khe Sanh. The village of My Lai. The prison known as the Hanoi Hilton. The rooftop of the United States Embassy in Saigon.  Today, the killing grounds of Khe Sanh and My Lai are grown over in places with rice paddy, verdant proof of the desire of the Vietnamese to put the war behind them, and much of the Hanoi Hilton is destined for the wrecking ball to make way for a modern office building.  But the old American Embassy is still here, the gravel-strewn rooftop still littered with United States Army-issue green vinyl sandbags and, now rusting, the helicopter landing pad that, as dawn approached on April 30, 1975, was the scene of the frantic, humiliating evacuation of the last Americans from Saigon. Hours after the Americans fled, the city was overrun by North Vietnamese troops and renamed for Ho Chi Minh.  The 20th anniversary of the evacuation is only five months off, and as it approaches the United States Embassy is being emptied again. This time it is the Vietnamese who are leaving.  The Vietnamese Government has ordered the current occupants, the state-owned oil company PetroVietnam and its affiliates, to vacate their offices by the end of next month to make way for the building's old tenants. Vietnam is about to hand the embassy compound back to the United States.  ""It's our building and for better or worse, good memories or bad, we get it back,"" said an American diplomat who is helping negotiate the return of the embassy building and 21 other American-owned properties, most of them seized by the North Vietnamese when they overran the South. ""There has been no decision about what to do with it. It's in bad shape.""  American officials who have inspected the six-story chancery, which was built in the mid-1960's for what was then a princely sum of $2 million, say that it has so deteriorated in southern Vietnam's unrelenting tropical heat that it may now be unusable.  The white concrete exterior is crumbling, with thick tangles of clinging vines and even small trees pushing through cracks in the building's grime-smeared shell. Inside, the plumbing and electrical wiring barely function. Toilets are flushed with water scooped out of plastic tubs lined up near the sinks.  The elevators broke down years ago, and the only way to the once-restricted sixth floor, where a series of American ambassadors and their military counterparts plotted in secret to save the South from the North Vietnamese threat, is up a dank staircase.  A separate, unlighted staircase leads from the sixth floor to the roof, and it was up those stairs that hundreds of Americans scrambled on that night in April 1975, desperate to get on board one of the helicopters shuttling between the embassy and Navy ships waiting off the coast.  ""I know this embassy is an historic place, historic both for the Vietnamese and the Americans,"" said Pham Van Tuan, who works at the building as a caretaker. He stood on the roof near a stack of rusty C-ration cans left behind 20 years ago by the American marines who manned the embassy's rooftop gun emplacements. ""I think this building should be a good symbol of the new friendship between the United States and Vietnam,"" he said.  It will not be used as an embassy again. The capital of the reunified nation is Hanoi, and the United States has found a new nine-story building there to serve as an embassy when full diplomatic ties are restored. American officials say the old embassy building here could possibly serve as a consulate, although it may be too big for that purpose.  If the building does come down, it would disappoint many of the Vietnamese who walk past it every day, especially the many southern Vietnamese who, whatever their memories of the war and the ignominious American departure, still remember the Americans fondly.  Chau Cam Khanh, 45, the director of a health clinic in Ho Chi Minh City, was born and raised in a city that he still calls Saigon, and he says he can remember the thwonk-thwonk-thwonk of the American helicopters that landed on the embassy on the night of the evacuation.  ""I could not see it because I was hiding, but maybe everybody in the city could hear it,"" he said. ""This is a bad memory.""  Still, the recollection does not shake his insistence that the crumbling embassy is ""very beautiful, and I think of it like an historical palace.""  ""I hope it stays forever.""  Americans might be forgiven for thinking differently about a structure that, as much as any in Vietnam, symbolizes the American failure here.  ""This building represents a terrible part of American history,"" said George Miller of Lido Beach, L.I., who stood outside the embassy early one morning with a busload of other American tourists.  Gerald Sobel, an internist from Chicago, shook his head as he stared up and down the hulk of the old embassy, agreeing that it might be best for the United States simply to tear it down.  ""Seeing it makes me think about the whole significance of our involvement in Vietnam,"" he said. ""I can understand how the local people might feel, but I think a new building might be better. It would give us a new start in Vietnam.""

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam   Not many calling cards list an alias, but even in Vietnam few people would know this slight, elegant 65-year-old woman by her real name, Trinh Thi Ngo.  The alias -- Thu Huong -- means Autumn Fragrance, the name she first used as an English-language radio announcer in the 1950's because it was easier for her non-Vietnamese listeners to pronounce.  ""Fewer syllables,"" she said in the clear, nearly accentless English that helped her become a legend. And even that is not the name that millions of American veterans would recognize.  For a generation of American troops at war in Indochina, Mrs. Ngo was Hanoi Hannah, the silky-voiced announcer on North Vietnamese radio, the Voice of Vietnam, who tried to convince American G.I.'s that the war was immoral, that they should lay down their arms and go home.  ""My work was to make the G.I.'s understand that it was not right for them to take part in this war,"" she said. ""I talk to them about the traditions of the Vietnamese, to resist aggression. I want them to know the truth about this war and to do a little bit to demoralize them so that they will refuse to fight.""  It was the Americans who dubbed her Hanoi Hannah, the Vietnam War's counterpart to Tokyo Rose.  ""I only heard the name later,"" said Mrs. Ngo, whose propaganda broadcasts to American troops lasted from 1965 until the Americans left in humiliation a decade later. ""Hanoi begins with an H; Hannah begins with an H,"" she said. ""The Americans like nicknames.""  After Saigon was overrun in 1975 and renamed for Ho Chi Minh, she moved here with her husband, a southerner who had been sympathetic to the Communists since student days. He is a retired engineer, while she still works in broadcasting, now at Vietnamese television.  Their home today is a simple, spotless apartment a few blocks from what used to be South Vietnam's Presidential Palace -- the ""den of the puppets,"" as it was called by the North Vietnamese propagandists during the war.  Reared in Hanoi during the French occupation, Mrs. Ngo was sent to private tutors in the early 1950's to study English, a language that Hollywood had made her eager to learn.  ""I always preferred American movies to French films,"" she said. ""The French talked too much. There was more action in American movies. I remember 'Gone With the Wind' with Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. It was so popular in Hanoi. I remember we took bread and sausages with us to the theater because it was such a long film.""  Mrs. Ngo joined the Voice of Vietnam in 1955, the year after the Communists under Ho Chi Minh ousted the French and took power in Hanoi after years in the jungle. She was selected as an announcer on the radio's new English-language shortwave service, which was beamed overseas.  ""I wanted to join the Voice of Vietnam because it was a good opportunity to help my country,"" she said, holding a silver-framed photograph that showed the staff of the Voice of Vietnam at a reception in 1967 with Ho Chi Minh and Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, the army commander.  ""I was not political. I was patriotic.""  Her work did not take an anti-American turn until 1965, when the first American ground troops landed in Vietnam and the Hanoi Government decided to begin special broadcasts to them. Using scripts prepared by the North Vietnamese Army, Mrs. Ngo said, she was never tempted to alter a word, no matter how strident the tone.  ""I agreed with these scripts,"" she said. ""We were trying to make the Americans understand that it was not right for them to be in Vietnam, that they were an aggressor, that this was a problem for the Vietnamese to sort out.""  Her 30-minute programs, which were repeated several times a day, were not known for their subtlety. Mrs. Ngo announced the names of the American troops who died in battle the previous month.  ""We wanted to make them a little bit sad,"" she said.  She also read clippings from American newspapers and magazines about anti-war demonstrations in the United States -- ""we thought if we used the American magazines, it would be more convincing"" -- to remind the troops of how unpopular the war was back home.  Mrs. Ngo said her goal was always to project a soothing, convincing voice. She said she never felt aggression toward Americans as a people ""except during the bombing"" -- the 1972 Christmas bombing of Hanoi, when she and her staff were evacuated to a remote station 20 miles from the capital.  ""When the bombs came, I did feel angry,"" she said. ""To the Vietnamese, Hanoi is sacred ground. But even then, when I spoke to the G.I.'s I tried always to be calm.""  And if she did once feel anger toward the United States, Mrs. Ngo insists that she put it behind her years ago. Like many northern Vietnamese, she expresses little but fascination today for the land of her former enemy, and she hopes someday to visit ""New York, Washington, many places.""  Her enthusiasm for things American also extended to music, she said. To entice the American troops to tune in to her show, the propaganda was intercut with music from records and tapes taken to Hanoi by visiting anti-war protesters from abroad.  ""We had Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and I always liked Elvis Presley,"" she said. ""He's 'the King,' yes?""

"   , Vietnam   IT is the first time in 1,000 years of history that the Vietnamese have welcomed foreign invaders. And they are pouring in, travelers who want to experience Vietnam, one of the last great adventure destinations in Southeast Asia.  The problem for the Vietnamese is that this is also one of the poorest and least-developed nations on earth, and the nation's tourism industry is struggling to keep up with the sudden crush.  The Government tourism agency forecasts one million visitors this year, up from 670,000 in 1993, an increase of 50 percent, and early bookings for next year suggest that tourism will continue to grow dramatically.  The Government is expecting the number to reach three million visitors a year by the year 2000.  Many of the newly arriving travelers are Americans who had held off traveling to Vietnam while an American trade embargo, imposed on Vietnam in 1975 at the end of the war, remained in place. President Clinton lifted the embargo in February, which eased travel for Americans by allowing them to use credit cards in Vietnam, and by allowing American tour agencies to do business here.  (In the final years of the embargo, Americans were allowed to visit Vietnam, but because of the credit-card restrictions, they usually had to bring in thick wads of American dollars, which are used in Vietnam as a second currency.)  While Vietnam and the United States are still without full diplomatic ties, a handful of American diplomats are now stationed in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, and can help American travelers with lost passports and other emergencies.  In welcoming foreign travelers, Vietnam's most impressive accomplishment may be the overhaul of its flag carrier, Vietnam Airlines, which has leased new Boeing and Airbus jets to replace a fleet of aging Russian planes. Many foreign business people working in Vietnam had refused to fly on the Russian planes because of what appeared to be justifiable concerns about safety.  While some of the Russian planes are still being used on domestic routes, Western jets now fly on the most heavily traveled route, between Hanoi and Vietnam's biggest city, Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  The European Airbus jets are leased from Air France and painted in Vietnam Airlines colors, and they are flown by pilots on assignment from the French carrier.  The Boeings are flown by pilots from Australia.  The big problem facing foreign travelers to Vietnam is the lack of hotel room of an international standard -- and the high rooms rates at the hotels that exist. With the opening of several new hotels in Ho Chi Minh City, the situation there has eased slightly, but room rates are still world class. The newly opened New World Hotel Saigon, the most luxurious hotel in the city, has rates beginning at $175 a night. But in Hanoi and several other cities, there is a desperate shortage of hotel rooms.  Hanoi has only one luxury hotel, the Sofitel Metropole, and there are not nearly enough other hotel rooms of any standard.  The general manager of the lovingly restored 109-room Metropole, Ricardo Perran, faces a predicament that other hotel managers can only dream of: a 98.5 percent occupancy rate year-round.  The scarcity of hotel rooms in Hanoi will probably get worse. No new large hotels are expected to open until 1996. The Metropole is adding a wing of 135 rooms, but it will not open until the spring of 1996. Mr. Perran and his staff are often put in the awkward position of turning away those who fail to book weeks ahead.  They can make exceptions only for the most important visitors. ""We won't turn down a Prime Minister,"" Mr. Perran said.  LOAD-DATE: December 11, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo: Vendors in a market in Hanoi.

"    If Christmas is a time for surprises, New York Times correspondents have had their share: along with the Japanese Santa and tree-trimming Muscovites there were the Serbian snipers, the bullets in Beirut, the tragic fire in Tennessee.  In writing of their most memorable Christmases away from home, 10 correspondents range around the world; some recall elegant feasts, in a Swabian castle or a Hong Kong hotel; others cannot forget the fruitcake they could not possibly eat in Somalia, the joy radiating from a Saigon cathedral, or the tearful Mass in Sarajevo. All remember how they counted their blessings.  We came from Hanoi, a cold and miserable place in December 1984 when two Congressmen, Steven Solarz and Robert Torricelli, took one of those tough trips that belies the luxurious image of a Congressional junket. We were on our way to Phnom Penh, still a definitively inhospitable place at the time. In between was Saigon -- almost no one calls it Ho Chi Minh City, then or now.  It was Christmas Eve, and a balmy night that obliterated the memory of chill, grim days on the rain-sodden, almost sullen streets of Hanoi. Saigon, the refuge of Catholics who fled North Vietnam in the 1950's, celebrated Christmas with a spirited vengeance.  Less than a decade after the end of the war, the country was still impoverished, but on Saigon's almost derelict streets, the atmosphere was one of national holiday: avenues and byways were thronged with people in a party mood. There were ad hoc Christmas shops and sidewalk markets selling meager but ingenious decorations -- hand-drawn paper angels and tree ornaments made of discarded holiday cards and bits of wool or string. Bakers had produced French-style Christmas logs, with cocoa sent by relatives in Australia or the United States.  The red-brick Cathedral of the Virgin Mary, rising from its island in a genteel city square, glowed with the warm light of hundreds of candles. Glorious music filled the nave and spilled out the open doors where an overflow congregation stood, many poor and thin, singing familiar hymns and responses in Vietnamese as I had not heard it used before. The only Vietnam I knew was the austere post-1975 state imposed by uncompromising party leaders in Hanoi who did their best to discourage religion, Buddhist and Christian alike.  The joy of Christmastime radiating from the cathedral drew throngs to the square, among them the war-disabled and orphaned hoping for a larger measure of charity on this night. Young people stood beside grandparents. Cyclo drivers paused to take in the sight.  For a few pennies, I bought some of the simple, homemade Christmas tree ornaments being sold on the streets. I'll take them out again this season, frail things that they are, to hang with the more opulent decorations. A decade later (now that blinking lights and imported colored balls no doubt trim Vietnamese trees) these little paper ornaments carry with them memories of an unexpected encounter with the resilient spirituality of Vietnam.

"     Mitch Epstein  Julie Saul Gallery  560 Broadway (near Prince Street)  SoHo  Through April 9  The people in Mitch Epstein's new color photographs, taken in Vietnam, Cambodia and Japan, seem always lost in reverie. For the most part, Mr. Epstein forgoes attempts to explain life in that country in favor of images of people alone, glimpsed on the street or in stores or homes.  At the Grand Hotel in Siem Reap, Cambodia, a bellhop in a crisp white jacket hides behind a tall potted plant, while on a road in Vietnam a young woman crouches by a wall, her face struck with light. Elsewhere in Vietnam, a man standing beside a blue pool table, cue in hand, pulls the corners of his mouth back in a grimace.  Occasionally, Mr. Epstein records details that suggest the flavor of the countries he visits. In one such image, a mirror reflects the ornate decor of the Hanoi opera house, from the French colonial era, but the mirror is also broken by a bullet hole.  Mr. Epstein makes remarkable use of light as an expressive element, but a few pictures are so intensely colored that they verge on the decorative. A photograph of a drinks menu in an army guest house in Hanoi, for example, appears next to a bouquet of roses, in various reds and pinks, placed in front of a gauzy turquoise curtain.  In another picture from Hanoi, a woman at an outdoor beauty shop sits beneath a towering red hair dryer that looks like a cross between a ceremonial headdress and a missile.  Richly evocative pictures of this sort give the show its sense of discovery.   CHARLES HAGEN  LOAD-DATE: April 1, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Review                      ",April 1 1994 ,11

"   , Vietnam   In Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City there are Vietnamese who wash down pizza with Coke, pay for things with American dollars, wear American flag patches on jackets and yell ""hello!"" at any ""big nose"" foreigner they see.  But the country still raises patriotic banners gloating over what the Communists regard as America's defeat in the Vietnam War. Beneath an outwardly friendly curiosity many Vietnamese display toward Americans, a predatory undertone tinged with bitter resentment is often detectable. There are many reminders for Americans visiting Vietnam of the lacerations left by a war that ended nearly two decades ago but that still colors Vietnamese attitudes.  Vietnam's political leaders face something of a quandary as they reshape national policy toward the United States.  On one hand, the 1975 victory over the South Vietnamese Government and its American ally, still fresh in the minds of many, is commemorated as a historic triumph comparable to America's victory over the British at Yorktown. America, to some, is still an enemy -- a fighting enemy to Communist military veterans, and a perfidious former friend to those Vietnamese who regard America's withdrawal from the war as a betrayal.  Much Is Needed And U.S. Can Help  Moreover, there are some who resent the 19 years it took Washington to lift its trade embargo, and the attitude of American conservatives who continue to block diplomatic recognition of the Hanoi Government.  But eclipsing these irritants, Vietnamese leaders have come to believe that there is a pressing need for American investment, technical aid, tourist visits and many other kinds of contact with the United States. Hanoi is even trying to persuade thousands of overseas Vietnamese (known as Viet Kieu), including Vietnamese-American refugees, to return to their native land and help rebuild it. Many have come back for temporary visits, and a few, disillusioned with life in the United States, expect to remain.  The Government is celebrating a double anniversary -- the 19th of the fall of Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war, on April 30, 1975, and the 40th of the fall of the French bastion at Dien Bien Phu on May 7, 1954.  Anti-American sentiments adorned some of the red-and-gold celebratory banners flown over streets for the occasion, but as a sign of the times, Vietnamese authorities did not include English or French translations that might have offended foreign visitors. Aside from the Communist slogans, visiting Americans -- tourists, business executives, journalists and officials of the United States Missing in Action Mission -- are treated by officials in Vietnam with studied courtesy and conciliation.  On the anniversary of Saigon's surrender to the Communists, for example, this correspondent was received at the home of Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap for a brief chat. The 83-year-old general, who commanded the Vietnamese Communist forces against both the French and the Americans, has been rated by Western military analysts as one of the greatest generals of the 20th century. But ""the victor of Dien Bien Phu,"" as he is often called, does not gloat.  Old Warrior Muses On Today's World  One subject of the conversation was the fall of Saigon in 1975, which this correspondent covered for The New York Times.  Imposing in his olive-green uniform and general's shoulder tabs, General Giap was avuncular and cordial, and clearly reluctant to say anything he thought an American might find objectionable. Speaking in French, he deferred benignly to frequent interjections and corrections from his wife, Dang Bich Ha, who was once a soldier in the Communist forces herself.  At his comfortable villa a few hundred yards from the Lenin-style mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh, General Giap, the supreme commander of Hanoi's legions from 1952 until 1977, mused on the changing state of the world.  ""In the traditional sense, the threat of colonialism and imperialism has disappeared,"" he said, ""and we shall probably not need to confront such threats again. We Vietnamese are optimists. But even though we face no shooting war in Vietnam, the world is in a very uncertain state, and Vietnam must always be willing to sacrifice to protect its freedom.""  He praised the ""fairness"" of American journalists, and said that after retiring from active command he had turned his attention increasingly to the war against pollution and the preservation of the environment -- causes he knew to be popular with the American press.  General Giap's masterly command of logistics and maneuver, and his deployment of artillery at the isolated Dien Bien Phu fortress in 1954, caught the French defenders by surprise and stunned world leaders; a peasant army had brought a well-armed European army to its knees.  General Giap's 1962 book ""People's War, People's Army,"" which outlines the mixture of political warfare and military strategy that was his hallmark, became a textbook for guerrilla insurgents in many parts of the world, and was highly regarded even by such longtime battlefield foes as the late Gen. William E. DePuy of the United States Army.  Although General Giap spent much of the anniversary of the fall of Saigon receiving Vietnamese military well-wishers and admirers, he took care in the interview to avoid any suggestion of belligerency.  ""We certainly have no fight with the American people,"" he said, ""and we welcome peaceful contacts with your country.""  But despite the diplomatic language Vietnamese leaders use with Americans, there remain many reminders of the war that most Americans would find galling.  On Hai Ba Trung Street in Ho Chi Minh City stands a tall, unkempt-looking building that was formerly the Brink Hotel -- a military billet erected for United States Army officers. On Christmas Eve 1964, Vietcong terrorists drove a jeep containing a huge bomb into the building's courtyard and set it off, killing two Americans and wounding 58.  Today a monument stands at the corner entrance of the building, adorned with a concrete relief sculpture depicting American dead and wounded scattered through the debris. In front of the marker is a single strip of barbed wire, symbolizing the huge thicket of barbed wire that surrounded the building in the war years.  A Forbidding Prison, Full of Memories  There is no marker at the floating My Canh Restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City, but many Americans remember it as the place where Vietcong bombs set off in June 1965 killed 44 diners, including 12 Americans. One, Sgt. Al Combs of the Special Forces, was killed along with his Vietnamese wife and their children.  Hanoi is also filled with disagreeable reminders of the war. At the Army Museum on Dien Bien Phu Street, a large bin containing dozens of flight helmets taken from American fliers shot down over North Vietnam is displayed. Outside, a freshly painted MIG-21 has been mounted; a sign says the aircraft shot down a dozen American planes.  The looming yellow walls and electrified wire surrounding Hoa Lo Prison in Hanoi -- known to Americans as the ""Hanoi Hilton"" -- remind visitors of a time when many American servicemen were imprisoned there, undergoing privation and mistreatment.  In Ho Chi Minh City, the former Doc Lap Presidential Palace has been restored as a museum intended to show the wasteful extravagance of the old regime, as abetted by the United States. Guides at the palace, English-speaking girls who had not even been born at the time Saigon fell, shepherd visitors through ""shamefully opulent"" reception chambers, a ballroom, dining halls and private quarters where South Vietnam's last President, Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu, spent his last days before fleeing to the United States.  Adorning the walls of District People's Committee headquarters and other official offices in many parts of Vietnam are photographs of Nguyen Van Troi bound to a stake and facing a firing squad in Saigon on Oct. 15, 1964. Troi, now a national hero for whom one of Ho Chi Minh City's main streets has been renamed, was caught and shot after trying to kill Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara by planting a bomb under a bridge Mr. McNamara's limousine was scheduled to cross.  The War Is Over; English Classes Call  At West Lake in Hanoi is a monument honoring city residents who helped to find and capture downed American airmen. At a small lake in the suburban Ngoc Ha (""Flower Village"") district of Hanoi is a monument honoring the antiaircraft missile crews that shot down American bombers in the 1960's and 1970's. In the middle of the lake stand a large fuselage section and wheels from a B-52 that was shot down at the spot in 1972, and was left where it fell.  Although the relic could offend some Americans, Vietnamese passers-by seldom spare it a glance. Many are hurrying to attend evening English classes offered at a school facing the lake, and the few Americans who visit the lake are usually hailed by children eager to practice their English. ""We all must learn English if we hope to become traders and make money,"" one said.  A recent American visitor to Hanoi was John Denver, the folk singer, who happened to arrive on the anniversary of the fall of Saigon to begin a series of concerts.  ""We had a phone call from an American back home who was under the mistaken impression that our first concert would coincide with the anniversary, and the caller didn't like what that seemed to imply,"" Mr. Denver said, ""but we reassured him our arrival on that day was just coincidence.""  Mr. Denver, who said he was exempt from the draft in the Vietnam War years because of a medical disability, said his concerts here -- the first by any American folk singer since the end of the Vietnam War -- had no political significance.  The Nation's Poverty Is Breeding Crime  The crime bred by Vietnam's poverty is not helping to heal Vietnamese-American relations. Gangs of street children envelop foreigners as they step out of their hotels, and theft is a constant threat. Believing that a recent American visitor could not understand Vietnamese, one gang leader was overheard instructing his scruffy lieutenants to obstruct her way in the next block so that confederates could grab her watch.  It seems to some American businessmen that many Vietnamese are determined to attract as much American investment as possible while giving as little as possible in return. ""In their eyes, Americans lost the war and although we are rich, we are weak,"" a businessman said. ""The idea seems to be to take us for all they can get.""  A Vietnamese former employee of an American company that had an office in Saigon before the Communist victory expressed a common view of Vietnamese who remained after their American colleagues fled.  ""We have had very difficult lives,"" he said. ""Some of us spent years in prisons, re-education camps and 'new economic zones' -- Vietnam's Siberias -- because we worked for Americans. But despite all, we love our country. I am glad I stayed, and so is my family. Some Vietnamese who opposed the Communists still resent America's leaders for abandoning Vietnam, but I say, forgive and forget.""  A Government official offered a more diplomatic view. ""The war brought us victory and we are proud of that,"" he said, ""but the hatred is past and we are getting on with the future. Part of that future means learning English and making American friends.""

"    More than a quarter century after he faced prison for refusing to fight in the battlefields of Vietnam, Muhammad Ali traveled to the former war zone last week to try to find comfort for the families of the Americans who disappeared there.  Mr. Ali, the 52-year-old former world heavyweight champion, was a sight as wrenching as some of the scenes of war he visited in Vietnam. He suffers from Parkinson's Disease, which has left him barely able to speak or walk, but his aides said he wanted to make the trip to Vietnam to demonstrate his support for the families of the more than 2,000 Americans still missing in action from the war. (As searching continued there last week, several sets of human remains were found, including some believed to be American.)  Mr. Ali was welcomed warmly by the Vietnamese -- both Government leaders and people on the street. Many remembered how Mr. Ali was stripped of his boxing title after his conviction for draft evasion in 1967, in the midst of the Vietnam War. He had refused to serve citing his conscientious objection as a devout Black Muslim, and returned to the ring after the conviction was overturned in 1970.  He traveled with two M.I.A. families who had invited Mr. Ali along on their own pilgrimage to Indochina.  ""He is a man of peace and good will,"" said Arnold Beizer, a Connecticut lawyer, who helped organize the trip.  ""He came here to build a bridge of friendship between our peoples.""   PHILIP SHENSON  LOAD-DATE: May 15, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 15 1994 ,11
"   , Vietnam   ""For 2,000 years, wars have seeded our land with the bones of the missing in action,"" the general told a visitor, ""and the American war produced a particularly rich crop. We'll never find most of our own dead soldiers, but they remain in our hearts.""  The speaker, Maj. Gen. Nguyen Trong Vinh, spent most of his 68 years fighting the French and the Americans, and he now publishes a monthly magazine for North Vietnamese and Vietcong veterans listing grave sites and missing soldiers and guerrillas.  Sometimes families who see the photographs, eyewitness reports and maps that the magazine publishes have been able to identify the resting places of missing husbands, fathers and sons.  The quest by the United States for its war dead and missing in Vietnam seems to have brought increased efforts by Hanoi to account for Communist troops who remain missing.  Besides offering information that might help identify Communist dead, ordinary Vietnamese also sometimes respond to an American advertisement in the yellow pages of Hanoi's telephone book that asks for information that could lead to the recovery of American bones. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, which has given Hanoi a few tips on where to look for Vietcong remains, has thanked the Vietnamese who have helped in the search for American servicemen.  Most Vietnamese families gave up hope many years ago of learning the fates of their missing, most of whom were buried where they fell. During the war, this correspondent saw the unidentified corpses of hundreds of Communist soldiers shoveled into unmarked mass graves all over South Vietnam, where relatives will probably never find them.  With no graves or urn niches to visit, bereaved families remember their dead by burning joss sticks and by offering symbolic food and drink to framed photographs of the dead in improvised household shrines. For Buddhists, who make up most of the population, the lack of a final resting place where an ancestor can be visited is a sad end to life.  Vietnam has no systematic reckoning of the Communist combatants who fell in battle, but most authorities agree the total was close to a million, the overwhelming majority listed as missing in action. On the allied side, 254,257 South Vietnamese soldiers were killed (many of them never recovered for burial), and the United States lost more than 47,000.  Search Intensifies  In the 19 years since the war ended, the search for American dead has never been more intense. The impetus from Washington has created joint Vietnamese-American search teams that are combing the country for human remains or clues to the fates of airmen. Pending diplomatic recognition of Hanoi, the only official American presence in Vietnam is the United States Joint Task Force Full Accounting Detachment 2.  On the Vietnamese side, hundreds of new military cemeteries have been set up throughout the northern part of the country as more remains are found and identified. Tall white monuments emblazoned with the gold star of Vietnam proclaim the cemeteries as the resting places of heroes among the victorious Communists.  The families of Vietnamese dead on the losing side are less fortunate. Many dead southerners have been removed from their graves and belatedly cremated. Mac Dinh Chi Cemetery in Saigon, which held the graves of many of South Vietnam's army officers and prominent political leaders, was closed by the Communists and turned into a park. Relatives were ordered to retrieve the bones of their dead.  A Constant Search  Although Vietnamese and American authorities are finding fewer bodies than they did when surveys began in the 1980's, the search continues. The campaign to account for every American has intensified since September 1988, when Hanoi first allowed American teams to look for the missing.  In April the 29th American Task Force, made up of 91 forensic anthropologists, medical technicians, graves-registration experts and others, arrived to work with Vietnamese on a new round of investigations.  Three teams of investigators and five teams specializing in excavation and recovery planned to spend 34 days investigating 62 cases at 17 sites where there were crashes or ground battles, using earth-moving equipment, jack hammers, aircraft and any other tools needed.  The highest priority goes to ""live sightings"" -- statements by people who claim to have seen Americans. Despite the special efforts made in these cases, no sighting has ever been authenticated, and American team leaders say no credible evidence supports the theory that Americans were held prisoner by the Vietnamese after 1973.  Deserters, Not M.I.A.'s  This view was corroborated by a former United States Army sergeant, John Foggin, who retired after 22 years of military service and now lives in the Mekong River delta.  Mr. Foggin, who served five years in Vietnam, said in a recent interview that in the final years before the Communist victory in 1975, there were ""lots and lots of American military deserters, hundreds of them in the Bien Hoa area near Saigon alone."" Many remained in Vietnam for months, he said, eventually making their way out through Cambodia to Thailand.  Some were almost certainly mistaken for prisoners, he said, but ""I've never believed there were any American M.I.A.'s held prisoner in Vietnam after the war.""  The current surveys will not be the last; in fact, American officials say they will search indefinitely.  Down to the Hard Cases  But with the passage of time, fewer cases are solved. ""By now, we're working on the hardest cases, and results come more slowly than they did when we first gained the cooperation of the Vietnamese,"" said K. Gary Flanagan, a 44-year-old specialist. Mr. Flanagan is one of seven American staff members at the search teams' spartan compound on the outskirts of Hanoi, known by its residents as the Ranch.  Mr. Flanagan, who learned Vietnamese before retiring from the Air Force, works for the Defense Department under the commander of the M.I.A. office, Lieut. Col. John Cray, the senior United States official in Vietnam.  Of the total of 2,234 Americans once listed by the Pentagon as missing in Southeast Asia, 1,643 disappeared in Vietnam.  Joint search teams have whittled down the tally, and on April 12, nine more sets of human remains suspected to be those of Americans were shipped to Hawaii, where experts will try to identify them.  Seeking Bodies of Prisoners  Since 1973, when the last American prisoners of war were released from Hoa Lo Prison (known as the Hanoi Hilton), 606 cases of Americans missing in action have been resolved. In the last two years alone, the remains of 124 people were shipped to Hawaii; some were later identified. About 1,000 M.I.A. cases in Vietnam remain unresolved.  United States officials say Hanoi is cooperating fully, after refusing for 15 years to let Americans search. But the disposition of the remains of 98 Americans who died during the war as prisoners of the Vietnamese remains a sore point. ""We feel the Vietnamese should account for all of them and return the remains,"" Mr. Flanagan said.  Vu Chi Cong, director of the Foreign Ministry's missing persons office, heads the team that works with the Americans. Mr. Cong says that he does not believe any more remains of Americans are likely to be found, but that intensive efforts will continue. Vietnam has already turned over more than 300 sets of American remains.  The search for dead is often dangerous. Of more than 1,000 investigations since 1988, many were in jungles and mountains where disease hazards include malaria, typhoid and rabies.  Relying on Tips  Maj. Kenneth H. Smith of the Air Force, operations officer for the detachment here, makes radio contact with each field team twice a day ""to make sure everything is all right, and to ask about any progress that may have been made.""  The search teams rely heavily on witnesses for tips on where to look, and these tips sometimes rouse investigators from their beds and send them scurrying. The searchers evaluate information immediately, and if a report seems credible, a joint team can reach a suspected casualty site in hours.  Although witnesses are encouraged by the Vietnamese and American governments to come forward, the United States offers no compensation or favors. A Vietnamese bringing information cannot hope to be rewarded with a job or a visa to go to the United States, for example.  ""Still, people do come in, sometimes with very important leads,"" Mr. Flanagan said. ""One guy had been out looking for scrap with a metal detector when he stumbled upon a buried crash site. We investigated and excavated the site, and recovered some remains.""  Using All the Clues  Even when bodies are not found, crash sites sometimes disclose the fates of airmen. Remnants of ejection seats that failed to operate sometimes provide proof that the occupants must have perished. Serial numbers on aircraft or their engines can be compared with lists of missions and their crews.  The Defense Department sometimes puts the families of missing Americans in touch with the detachment here or with one of the other M.I.A. offices in Laos or Cambodia.  ""We welcome contacts with relatives who can sometimes give us information that helps in identification,"" Mr. Flanagan said. ""It sometimes helps the families to know just what we're doing to look for their people.""   LOAD-DATE: May 20, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  SERIES: Vietnam Revisited -- A periodic report.

"      Hanoi and Washington have agreed in principle to exchange diplomats within three months, a senior Vietnamese official said today.  The official, Le Van Bang, Vietnam's representative to the United Nations, made the remarks at a business conference that involved the first major Vietnamese delegation to visit the United States since President Clinton lifted a trade embargo on Feb. 3.  The two sides began negotiating the exchange soon after Mr. Clinton ended the trade ban. But Washington has linked full diplomatic ties to continued cooperation by Hanoi in tracing missing servicemen.   LOAD-DATE: May 20, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 20 1994 ,11
"    Da Nang is now a stop for cruise ships. Cam Ranh Bay may get Club Med as a neighbor. And the Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed the Hanoi Hilton by Americans held there during the Vietnam War, is really becoming a hotel.  The travel industry, which has been slowly discovering Vietnam as a tourist destination over the last few years, is scrambling to cut more deals there since President Clinton lifted the American trade embargo in February, making it easier for Americans to invest and travel.  Cruise lines are adding Vietnam's ports to their itineraries. Avis, National and Hertz are negotiating to rent cars there. Club Med wants to open a multimillion-dollar resort 30 miles north of Cam Ranh Bay, which, like Da Nang, was the site of an American military base.  And several hotel chains, including Radisson, Marriott and Choice, are talking to developers about opening hotels in Vietnam.  ""It's estimated Vietnam needs as much as $40 billion to upgrade its infrastructure,"" said Jim Olson, senior vice president for Hawaii and Asia-Pacific development of Minneapolis-based Radisson. ""With that kind of demand you'll have lots of businessmen, technicians and support personnel needing roofs over their head, in addition to the growing number of tourists.""  To prevent ""our competitors winding up serving our guests,"" as Mr. Olson put it, Radisson and potential partners from Thailand and Malaysia anticipate putting up hotels in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (the former Saigon), and Da Nang.  Avis is also moving aggressively. ""We've had a lot of interest from investors who want franchises in Hanoi and Saigon,"" said Michael Collins, an international vice president, ""and because we see good growth opportunities there, we're moving as quickly as we can to stay ahead of the pack.""  Travel companies view Vietnam as an important link in an expected surge in travel to and within Asia.  Tourist receipts in the Asia-Pacific region will account for 30.6 percent of $527 billion in worldwide tourist revenue in the year 2,000, up from 15.1 percent in 1990, according to the World Tourism Organization. Air travel in the region is expected to grow 7.5 percent a year -- nearly twice the world average.  ""All the statistics show that Vietnam tourism is on a faster growth track than any country in Asia, maybe even more than the rest of the world,"" said Chuck Y. Gee, dean of the School of Travel Industry Management at the University of Hawaii.  Competition Intensifying  Some travel experts warn against over-optimism and note that Vietnam is far from ready to play host to visitors on a large scale. Still, the tourist companies elbowing to the front of the line envision a market that can average 10 percent annual growth in the number of visitors throughout the decade and generate much more than the $230 million that the Vietnamese Tourism Department said the country earned from 670,000 foreign visitors last year.  Nguyen Thi Hong, a press officer with the Vietnamese Mission to the United Nations, said the country expected a million tourists this year and 1.6 million by the end of the century. While that is a far cry from Hong Kong's 8.9 million annual visitors, or Singapore's 6.4 million, it would be a vast leap from the 20,000 who visited Vietnam in 1986.  ""We want to develop tourism, so we welcome everyone,"" Mrs. Hong said. Americans, she said, would receive a warm welcome.  Expatriate Vietnamese and American veterans of the Vietnam War are expected to account for much of the first wave of American visitors. Americans, no longer forced to obtain Vietnamese visas in Thailand and Hong Kong, can get them in three to five weeks by applying to the Vietnamese Mission in New York.  Credit Cards in the Future  Lifting the embargo also ended the Treasury Department's $200 daily limit on expenditures by Americans in Vietnam. When the regulatory agencies work out details, prohibitions are also expected to be lifted on the use of credit cards issued by American banks.  Because only a quarter of Vietnam's estimated 22,000 hotel rooms are up to international standards, dozens of hotels are under construction, most as joint ventures between the Government and European and Asian hotel companies. A Singapore group, for example, is teaming up with Vietnam in a $33 million project to turn the Hoa Lo Prison into a 22-story hotel and office tower in Hanoi.  About $200 million is being invested in five golf courses. A few months ago, the Da Lat Golf Club opened the country's first 18-hole course. Memberships in the club, a $40 million joint venture with Hong Kong investors, range from $15,000 to $60,000.  Several United States airlines are awaiting permission to fly to Vietnam. Which carriers are awarded the routes will ultimately depend on Washington and Hanoi, but United, Continental and Northwest have already staked claims to routes. And Delta Air Lines, with few Pacific routes, recently agreed with Vietnam Airlines to coordinate flight schedules to an intermediate city in Asia that has not yet been designated.  Many cruise lines are considering offering Vietnam visits this year, while Royal Cruise, Holland America, Royal Viking, Orient Lines and Seven Seas Cruise Line may add more Vietnamese ports to cruises, some of which have been stopping at Vietnamese ports for several years.  Seabourn Cruise Line was so pleased with two sold-out cruises that called at Vietnam that it is adding two more next year. The Club Med 2, Seabourn's sailing ship, will have five weeklong Vietnam cruises. And starting Nov. 21, Pearl Cruises is offering a 17-day Vietnam trip that will include a 30-hour on-board seminar with Vietnamese officials and foreign investors in Vietnam.  Book publishers are getting into the act, too. Houghton Mifflin, Lonely Planet and Passport Books recently published new or revised guidebooks on the country.  While some experts say that the number of American tourists, drawn by the allure of a destination that has been off-limits for so long, will increase substantially after normalization of diplomatic relations -- something the travel industry hopes for no later than next year -- they also warn that some assertions about Vietnam's tourist potential are overblown.  Skepticism From Rambo  ""Some investors will strike it rich,"" said Dr. A. Terry Rambo, a specialist on Indochina at the East-West Center in Honolulu. ""But everybody and his brother seems to want into Vietnam, for reasons not entirely economically rational.""  ""Vietnam only has a few good hotels and not much other infrastructure necessary to handle a big increase in visitors,"" said Dan Sullivan Jr., head of Collette Travel Service in Pawtucket, R.I., a major tour operator. ""Our customers are not talking about visiting Vietnam.""  Passport Books warns in its guidebook that the Vietnam tourism industry ""is still unable, because of bureaucratic obstacles, to offer many of the different services that are readily available in the rest of Asia.""  A group of French bankers recently discovered as much when they spent the night searching for a hotel in Hanoi because the Orient Hotel forgot that the group had made reservations. And the Vietnamese Investment Review, a journal published in Hanoi, recently reported that some Vietnam tour agencies sell package tours without having hotel rooms or rental cars available.  Charles Man, the owner of Sino-American Tours in New York's Chinatown, said it is hard to sell Vietnam as a single destination. ""Because of the distance and cost,"" he said, ""Vietnam visits have to be combined with other destinations,"" often Hong Kong and Bangkok.  Sino-American, Absolute Asia, South Sea Tour and Travel, All Adventure Travel, Myths and Mountains and Creative Travel are among the growing handful of companies offering tours that include Vietnam. Depending on length and stopovers, most tours from the United States run $1,800 to $5,000 a person, plus air fare. Visitors from Asian countries tend to spend less.  Trade First  Tourism experts acknowledge that trade, rather than educational or leisure travel, will initially be more profitable, although they expect each to complement the other.  ""Our best estimate is that there's likely to be $2 billion to $4 billion in trade between the two countries in the next couple of years,"" said Virginia Foote, director of the United States-Vietnam Trade Council in Washington. About 90 percent of that is expected to come in the sale of American goods, she said, especially consumer products.  But for tourism to develop into a big business, the Vietnamese must have repeat customers.  ""So unless Vietnam improves its inadequate infrastructure,"" Professor Rambo said, ""all those rosy tourism projections are likely to prove disappointing.""

"      The United States and Vietnam announced today that they would set up diplomatic missions in a move that the two longtime enemies said was an important step toward normalizing relations.  The agreement comes two decades after the two countries fought a war that divided the United States and cost more than 1 million Vietnamese lives and more than 58,000 American lives.  American officials said the missions would open in two to three months and would help the United States pursue its efforts to account for the 2,233 Americans still listed as missing in Indochina.  The announcement today is part of the Administration's strategy of gingerly building relations with Vietnam as President Clinton faces criticism from veterans groups for not obtaining enough information from Vietnam about missing Americans.  Not Yet Relations  Michael McCurry, the State Departmnt spokesman, emphasized in a news briefing today that the exchange of missions did not constitute full diplomatic relations. He said that before the United States takes the major step of establishing full relations and embassies, it first wanted Vietnam to do more to improve its human rights record.  Speaking about the new diplomatic missions, Mr. McCurry said: ""This office should facilitate progress on all issues of concern, particularly P.O.W.-M.I.A. accounting. The liaison office also will enable us to provide services for an increasing number of Americans in Vietnam and advance our human rights dialogue.""  Such missions or liaison offices are typically smaller than full-fledged embassies and are not headed by ambassadors. The American mission will be in Hanoi, and is expected to have 10 to 20 diplomats.  Administration officials said it would be headed by James Hall, a longtime Foreign Service officer.  Exchange of Property  American officials said the United States agreed to establish the missions only after Vietnam committed itself to returning diplomatic property that the United States owned in South Vietnam before 1975, the year the Saigon government collapsed.  When President Clinton announced on Feb. 3 that he was ending the 19-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam, Administration officials said they would agree to establishing diplomatic missions once the property disputes and several other disputes were resolved.  Under today's agreement, Vietnam would give back to the United States the old American Embassy compound in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon. At the same time, Hanoi would receive the old South Vietnamese Embassy in Washington. The actual opening of the missions will hinge on completing the agreement to return each country's diplomatic properties.  According to American and Vietnamese officials, the diplomatic missions would handle trade and business, tourism and culture.  Trade and Tourist Explosion  Since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo, there has been an explosion of trade and a flood of American visitors to Vietnam as companies investigate investment opportunities there. The planned mission in Hanoi is designed to assist this flow of trade and visitors.  At present, the only official American office in Vietnam is one seeking information on the Americans missing in action. Vietnam's only office in the United States is its mission to the United Nations.  Although some veterans groups maintain that Vietnam continues to hide information about missing Americans, Mr. McCurry said today that ""there has been extraordinarily good cooperation"" from Hanoi in helping the United States investigate its missing soldiers.  Administration officials said Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, would probably go to Vietnam late next month as head of a delegation that seeks further information about missing Americans and discusses establishing full relations.  This is not the first time that the United States will set up a diplomatic mission before a full-fledged embassy. After more than two decades without relations, the United States and China set up liaison offices in each other's capitals in 1974. Five years later the two nations established full diplomatic relations.   LOAD-DATE: May 27, 1994  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 27 1994 ,11
"   , Vietnam, July 9   Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to meet with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister in Bangkok this month, senior Vietnamese officials disclosed today. The meeting would be the first between the foreign-policy chiefs of the former foes since the Communist victory in 1975.  Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, who oversees relations with the United States, declined to confirm formally that the meeting was set. But he said in an interview, ""I think there is a high possibility.""  Mr. Christopher and the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, will be in the Thai capital to attend consultations among 18 nations on security matters after the annual foreign ministers' meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  The high-level Vietnamese-American meeting was arranged during a visit here earlier this month by Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord and Hershel Gobel, the Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Their talks were part of a longstanding effort to normalize Vietnamese-American relations, which took a major step forward in February when President Clinton lifted the trade embargo that had been in force since the end of the Vietnam war.  Liason Offices to Open  Mr. Mai said liaison offices -- the precursors of embassies - would be opened in Hanoi and Washington once American officials found a suitable building here.  The United States owns the building of its former consulate here in Hanoi. But Mr. Mai said ""dozens of families"" lived in the building now and it would take time to relocate them.  ""We think there should be an interim solution,"" he said. United States officials here are looking for interim quarters.  The diplomat who has been named to head the American office, James H. Hall, is visiting. Now the director of the State Department's Office of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, he served as an adviser during military service in South Vietnam.  Vietnamese officials said they expected the liaison offices to open within a month or two but that they doubted Mr. Clinton would soon raise them to embassy status.  Americans Divided  ""The division in American society on the question of Vietnam remains deep,"" an official said, speaking on condition that he not be named. ""It will take some time.""  But he said Vietnam saw the difference between a liaison office and a full-fledged embassy largely as one of name, and that it was ready to give the top American representative here the same access to Government leaders he would have if he were an ambassador.  Mr. Mai said Mr. Lord and Mr. Gobel had come to Hanoi this month ""to thank the Vietnamese people for their cooperation"" in working to resolve the issue of the 2,231 Americans still listed as missing from the war in Indochina. Despite both officials expressing satisfaction with the continuing progress, leaders of American veterans organizations who accompanied them ""had a different opinion.""  The Deputy Minister said Vietnam had agreed to two requests made by the officials and the veterans' leaders. One was for greater unsolicited efforts by the Vietnamese, particularly in searching through the records of various ministries for clues to the fate of the missing. The Hanoi Government also agreed to appeal to its citizens to come forward with any information they might have on a missing serviceman's case.  Concerns Over Instability  Mr. Mai said Vietnam was concerned about instability in Cambodia but was determined to remain ""disinvolved."" Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and overthrew the regime of Pol Pot, the leader of the widely feared Khmer Rouge. It withdrew its last troops in 1989.  The Deputy Foreign Minister said that the agreements reached in 1991 on a transition to peace in Cambodia had committed all major and regional powers to preserving the country's stability, and Vietnam would adhere to the ""multilateral approach"" even in seeking protection of the ethnic Vietnamese there. Vietnamese are widely resented in Cambodia and have fallen victim to mass killings there since last year.  The Deputy Minister said that in discussing human rights, Mr. Lord had asked for information on the well-being of four Vietnamese imprisoned for political offenses. He toldthe Americans that the four were in good health.  Ten Americans are imprisoned here, some for political offenses. A European diplomat with connections to Vietnamese officials said the authorities were nervous about possible opposition activity by former Vietnamese citizens visiting from the West.  Mr. Mai said Vietnam would recognize as foreign nationals only those emigres who had taken legal steps to divest themselves of Vietnamese citizenship.  The American Presence     Alluding to Vietnamese concern about American interest in human-rights cases here and possible linkage to trade privileges, the Deputy Foreign Minister said he considered Mr. Clinton's decision to extend most-favored-nation status to China as ""suitable to international trends.""  Mr. Mai disputed a widely held view that Vietnam's eagerness for an American presence here was based on a desire to use Washington as a counterbalance to China, Vietnam's historic enemy. He said it would be bad diplomacy to play off one big power against another now that the cold war is over.  ""All major powers, without exception, should be able to play an active role in Southeast Asia, and none should have a feeling of being left out,"" he said.  Mr. Mai said Vietnam and the United States had agreed to recognize ownership of Government assets in each others' countries and that senior legal officials would meet in Bangkok on Aug. 1-3 to work out details.

"   , Vietnam, Sept. 8   American search teams have recovered remains believed to be those of a marine who died in captivity during the Vietnam War, a United States official said today. The discovery was greeted as a breakthrough by United States officials in Hanoi, who are investigating 84 cases of Americans missing in action from the war.  Investigators were led to the grave site, in Quang Ngai Province, by a former American soldier who had buried the body. The soldier, Thomas Davis, of Eufala, Ala., was released from the camp in 1973 when all American forces withdrew from Vietnam.  Washington described 84 ""special remains cases"" to Hanoi a year ago; today's was the first discovery.  Mr. Davis said as many as 10 Americans died in the camp. One was killed trying to escape, he said; others, like the marine, died from malnutrition and lack of medical care.

"   , Vietnam   In 1966, at the height of the Vietnam War, Senator George Aiken became famous for suggesting that we simply declare victory and bring American troops home. That victory was phony, but 29 years later we truly have one in Vietnam, if winning is measured by a Vietnam that is economically, politically and strategically pro-Western. Yet despite that victory, Washington is reluctant to open full diplomatic relations with Hanoi and consolidate its tentative move into America's orbit. It's time. It's time we started relating to Vietnam as a country, not a conflict. It's time that we declare victory and go back to Vietnam to reap it.  President Bush should have been the one to open relations. He knew it was the right thing to do, and he had the credibility with veterans' groups to do it. But he didn't. (Wouldn't be prudent.) President Clinton, despite his problems with Vietnam vets, has inched closer to Hanoi, by lifting economic sanctions last year and agreeing to a low-level liaison office this year. For months the State Department has been quietly recommending full normalization, but after the midterm Republican rout the White House said ""Forget it."" (Wouldn't be prudent.) That is America's loss.  Vietnam's 72 million industrious, literate people are building a market economy from the ground up. Because U.S. diplomats and businesses are not here in force as the foundation stones are laid and the legal system is reformed, this means U.S. standards, regulations and laws are not being wired in. Australia already dominates the phone system, British Petroleum has the oil sector and Singapore advises on the legal code.  I was riding in a taxi here the other day and the driver was studying English from BBC tapes. For 30 minutes I had to listen to a repetition of: ""I like football. I like Manchester United,"" the prominent British soccer team. When they think football here they don't think Dallas Cowboys, and when they think telephones they don't think AT&T.  Strategically, the big issue in Asia will be the containment of China, whose military might, and appetite, will grow as China grows. There is no more powerful counterweight to Beijing than Hanoi, whose tiny army bludgeoned China's in their 1979 border war. China is Vietnam's historical enemy. Most of Hanoi's boulevards are named for heroes of the wars against China. The biggest display in the Hanoi Army Museum is not of Vietnam's victory over the U.S. in 1975, but its victory over the Mongols from the north in 1288. A U.S.-Vietnam entente would get China's attention -- and keep it.  As for our M.I.A.'s, every U.S. official dealing with this issue says Vietnamese cooperation has improved (not diminished, as opponents of relations predicted) since we lifted the economic embargo. The reason is not anything the Hanoi Government is doing, but because the Vietnamese people, villagers and veterans, are now coming forward with information about graves and bones that they were holding back as long as America was embargoing them economically. U.S. M.I.A. officials say normal relations and more Americans traveling here would only elicit more grass-roots cooperation, which is the only way the 1,621 remaining M.I.A. cases will be resolved.  It is pathetic that a small, vindictive cult of M.I.A. activists in America -- who broadcast U.F.O. sightings of P.O.W.'s roaming the Vietnamese countryside and demand we withhold normalization to punish Hanoi for a war we never should have fought -- have intimidated Washington into a Vietnam policy that is bad for M.I.A.'s and bad for America.  The Vietnamese, who have 300,000 M.I.A.'s, have let the future bury the past. As Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told me: ""If we nursed all of our grudges with all the powers that we have fought against, we wouldn't have relations with anyone. The war divided your society; recognizing Vietnam would put this behind you. It would heal your own wounds.""  He's right. It's time we too buried the past. Hue today is a cuisine, not a battle; Tet is a New Year's celebration, not an offensive; Haiphong is a harbor, not something to be bombed at Christmas; and Highway 1 is where they run the Hanoi Marathon, not the military artery of an enemy nation. President Clinton didn't start this war, and he didn't fight this war, but with a little bit of courage, he could finally end this war.

"      Taking a major step toward full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, the United States announced today that it would open a liaison office in Hanoi on Saturday and sign an agreement to exchange diplomats.  The agreement will not establish full diplomatic relations. Low-level diplomats will be exchanged, with the first American diplomats stationed in Vietnam since April 1975, when the final American troops and officials pulled out as Communist troops moved to capture Saigon.  [The agreement was signed Saturday in Hanoi by James H. Hall, the diplomat who will direct the American liaison office, and Nguyen Xuan Phong, director of the Americas Department at the Foreign Ministry, The Associated Press reported.]  Today's announcement was the latest in a hesitant, yearlong series of steps toward establishing full relations, which entail opening embassies, appointing ambassadors and possibly granting preferential trade rights that are given to friendly countries.  The Administration has been somewhat torn on the topic, between a desire to allow American businesses to join in the scramble to rebuild Vietnam, and pressure from veterans' groups and conservatives not to rush the process.  State Department officials said it might take years before the countries exchange ambassadors. They said the main factor determining the pace of normalization would be how cooperative Vietnam is in providing information about 2,211 American soldiers still listed as missing from the Vietnam War. A total of 58,135 Americans died in the war.  As State Department officials described it, the United States is holding out full diplomatic relations as a carrot to insure future Vietnamese cooperation.  Benjamin A. Gilman, a New York Republican who heads the House International Relations Committee, criticized today's move, saying it was wrong to upgrade ties with Vietnam just weeks before Secretary of Defense William J. Perry is to give Congress the latest information on Americans missing in Indochina. ""By moving ahead toward normalcy in this precipitous manner, I believe the President has broken trust with the American people,"" he said.  John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion, said, ""We certainly oppose any further moves toward normalization until they effect the fullest possible accounting, and they haven't done that by a long shot.""  The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia said it was glad ""the fullest possible accounting will remain the highest priority."" But it said it expected that the coming Pentagon report would confirm that Vietnam was not cooperating fully.  The first big change in American policy came last February when President Clinton, declaring that Vietnam had cooperated in furnishing information about M.I.A.'s, lifted the 19-year trade embargo.  A senior State Department official said today that Vietnam had been generally cooperative since then, especially on joint activities like excavations that are financed by the United States. The officials said 61 sets of remains have been turned over since February, although the Pentagon has yet to ascertain whether they are those of American servicemen.  The official criticized Vietnam for not doing more unilaterally, for example, by turning over confidential documents long buried in archives or turning over remains from parts of the country that Pentagon investigators are not allowed to visit.  ""The Vietnamese are doing more in this area, especially in establishing processes and institutions to pursue unilateral activities, but we haven't seen much in the way of results,"" a senior State Department official said. ""More has to be done before we can go to full diplomatic relations.""  In May, the United States and Vietnam exchanged letters that pledged to allow liaison offices once they settled disputes about seized diplomatic property and outstanding financial claims, something they estimated would take about a month to negotiate.  It was only last month, however, that the two nations reached an agreement on financial claims, with Vietnam promising to pay $208.5 million for private and government claims, 100 percent of what the Administration had sought. According to the State Department, almost all the claims were made by individuals or companies, and many are for houses or oil-drilling equipment that had been expropriated. The United States has agreed to unfreeze $130 million in Vietnamese assets.  To head the liaison office, the State Department has named James H. Hall, a longtime Foreign Service officer and a former Army captain in Vietnam. The office will be in a new nine-story building in downtown Hanoi and will open with 6 Americans diplomats, soon growing to 12.  In Washington the Vietnamese liaison office will be in the old South Vietnamese Embassy on R Street. Vietnamese officials said today that the office would have eight employees and would be headed by Le Van Bang, now Vietnam's delegate to the United Nations.  The liaison office in Hanoi will also be used by the approximately 100 Pentagon staff members who visit Vietnam every six weeks to search for information about the missing. Much of its mission will be to provide assistance to American companies seeking to do business in Vietnam.   LOAD-DATE: January 28, 1995  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 26 1995 ,11

"    A new book based on Vietnamese military archives asserts that Hanoi withheld considerable information on American prisoners of war for decades, and began releasing it only after the cold war, when Soviet-bloc support evaporated and Vietnam urgently sought to end an American-led economic embargo.  ""Perhaps hundreds"" of Americans who survived crashes and ambushes were killed by their captors in the 1960's and 1970's, Vietnamese officers are quoted as saying in the book, ""Inside Hanoi's Secret Archives: Solving the M.I.A. Mystery.""  The book was written by Malcolm McConnell of Reader's Digest, a former Foreign Service officer, using material provided by an American researcher, Theodore G. Schweitzer 3d. It is a summary of the pieces of information that have been put together so far about those missing at the end of the Vietnam War, and suggests that the number of Americans killed in captivity was higher than previously believed.  Mr. Schweitzer, who has often been in the public eye but rarely speaks to the press, describes himself as a former librarian. He was a field officer in Thailand for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. After the war he was involved in private relief efforts to aid the Vietnamese.  Colleagues from his United Nations days remember him as an adventurer, and he was known around Southeast Asia for his tales of derring-do. He told the Vietnamese that he was an independent author, although when most of his archival work was done he was a covert agent of American defense intelligence. Mr. Schweitzer did the bulk of his research in Hanoi in 1992, armed with a scanner provided by American agents and a good supply of dollars to reward the Vietnamese army archivists assigned to help him.  Soon after his project became public, the United States military was able to set up its own research teams in Vietnam, where work continues.  The author and researcher believe that the Vietnamese understood and accepted the ruse because Hanoi wanted to use an indirect conduit to Washington to test American reaction to material it had previously withheld.  Some officials who have been close to the issue say that the fact that the Vietnamese withheld information in cases where there were serious questions helped to fuel a militant P.O.W.-M.I.A. movement in the United States.  ""We know the Vietnamese had a lot of information they had not given us,"" Roger Shields, a former Pentagon official who was in charge of the prisoner release when the United States withdrew its troops from Indochina in 1973, said in an interview this week. ""We were not surmising. We absolutely knew, and they knew we knew.""  The book, published on Jan. 25 by Simon and Schuster, quotes a Vietnamese officer identified as Lieut. Col. Nguyen Van Thi as saying, ""Our Government does not want America to know that our darkest secret is that we killed many American prisoners in cold blood.""  Officials in Hanoi say this is fiction.  Former Pentagon officials say that they have always known of some cases of murder or death by torture, some of them incidents disclosed by Vietnam during the war and others described by American prisoners released in 1973.  At the time, however, President Richard M. Nixon, beginning to come under pressure from the Watergate scandal, overrode Defense Department apprehensions and declared on March 27, 1973, that ""all of our American P.O.W.'s are on the way home.""  Yesterday, Hanoi and Washington signed an agreement to exchange diplomats with Vietnam for the first time in two decades. The action came just a few weeks before Defense Secretary William J. Perry is to give Congress the latest information on Americans missing in Indochina. Officials said that the United States is holding out full diplomatic relations as an incentive for cooperation from Vietnam.  Officials at the Pentagon would not discuss the book, but Beverly Baker, a spokeswoman for the Prisoner of War-Missing in Action Office at the Defense Department, said that Mr. Schweitzer's work to confirm that records were available in Hanoi allowed the Pentagon to establish the research there on an official footing.  Hanoi, eager to see the embargo lifted before President Bush left office, quickly complied with the request to permit the research. It was another two years before the Clinton Administration lifted trade barriers, and since then dozens of cases of missing Americans have been solved.  The book appears to corroborate the belief that Hanoi did not make a full accounting of missing Americans, despite its insistence to the contrary.  But the book returns to some cases and demolishes some of the more extreme claims, that Americans were knowingly left behind in Vietnam and that Washington has covered up the fact.  The McConnell-Schweitzer account also discounts reports that Americans were turned over to the Soviet military by the Vietnamese, as prisoners were by Communist forces in Korea in the 1950's. It was in that context that Colonel Thiwas reportedly told Mr. Schweitzer that ""giving American prisoners to the Russians was not our darkest secret"" and then proceeded to talk about executions and deaths under torture.  Mr. Schweitzer told the author that Hanoi held files that might shed light on the deaths. These included the so-called Blue Files, which Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and co-chairman of a now-disbanded Senate Select Committee on P.O.W-M.I.A. Affairs, tried unsuccessfully to pry loose in 1992.  In the 22 years since United States forces were withdrawn, the debate over those missing in Indochina has polarized into a confrontation between those who believed that Vietnam did all it could to account for prisoners, and those who not only think that Hanoi withheld information but also often believe that some Americans remain alive in captivity.  In between has been a small, often silent but experienced group of officials and veterans who have argued that it is inconceivable that American prisoners could still be alive but it is also certain that Hanoi knew far more than it acknowledged about many cases.  Today, the United States lists 2,211 Americans still officially missing in action in Southeast Asia. About half are known to have died, but remains have not been recovered. Only a few dozen cases are considered genuine puzzles that the Vietnamese are likely to have the power to solve.  A spokeswoman at the Foreign Ministry in Hanoi dismissed the book as a ""fabrication,"" adding that the timing of its publication was intended to derail improved relations.

"   , Vietnam, Jan. 28   With toasts of sweet Russian champagne, American and Vietnamese diplomats marked the signing today of an agreement that will allow the United States to raise the flag over the first American diplomatic mission in Vietnam in nearly 20 years.  The agreement signed in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, gave the United States immediate custody of a modern nine-story office building here that will serve as the base of operations for American diplomats until the two countries are able to reach agreement on the establishment of full diplomatic relations and the opening of embassies.  American diplomats, who have been stationed in Hanoi for more than a year, said that they would begin to move into the building this weekend and expected to open its doors to the public and raise the American flag next Friday, the day after the Vietnamese end their celebration of Tet, the lunar new year and Vietnam's most important holiday.  Their Vietnamese counterparts in Washington are expected to take over within days the former South Vietnamese Embassy there and use it as their liaison office. The building was abandoned after the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975. Until today, American diplomats in Hanoi had worked in a compound maintained by the Defense Department for its investigators who are assigned here to determine the fate of more than 1,600 American servicemen still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.  It is the issue of the missing Americans that is still holding up full diplomatic relations between Hanoi and Washington, with the United States insisting that it will not open an embassy here and send an ambassador until there is further progress in the investigations.  ""I'm pleased and honored to be given the heavy responsibility of achieving the fullest possible accounting of servicemen missing in action,"" said James Hall, the American diplomat who will direct the mission and who signed the agreement. ""This is the top priority of our establishing the liaison office in Hanoi.""  Mr. Hall last served in Vietnam in the 1970's, when he was assigned to the United States Embassy in Saigon, which was renamed Ho Chi Minh City after it fell to North Vietnamese forces.  American diplomats in Hanoi were told by the State Department to avoid all but the most innocuous public statements today to reporters, apparently out of fear that the agreement would anger leading Republicans in Congress. The signing ceremony in a Vietnamese Government reception hall was notably brief and subdued.  The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, joined eight other members of Congress in sending a letter last Tuesday to President Clinton, asking that the opening of the liaison office in Hanoi be postponed. They said that Vietnam still appeared to be holding back information about missing Americans. Relations between the United States and Vietnam have been warming for several years, with the most important step toward the establishment of full diplomatic relations taken last February, when President Clinton lifted a 19-year-old American trade embargo.  Under today's agreement, the United States will also take custody of the old Saigon embassy, although diplomats say that it is unclear whether the crumbling structure, which until last month was used as offices by the Vietnamese state oil company, can again be made habitable. The liaison office in Hanoi is the first American diplomatic mission in this city since December 1955, when an American consulate here was closed. The United States withdrew its presence from Hanoi after refusing to recognize the Communist Government, led by Ho Chi Minh, that had replaced a French colonial regime in 1954.

"      With little fanfare, Vietnam opened its liaison office here today, a step toward normalizing relations two decades after the United States abandoned efforts to defeat the Communist Government in Hanoi.  On Friday, the United States opened a liaison office in Hanoi.  ""Our mission here is to continue work on improving relations,"" said Le Van Bang, Vietnam's former delegate to the United Nations.  The office, on the fifth floor of a building less than a mile from the State Department, will be used only until renovations are completed on the Embassy Row mansion used by the former Government of South Vietnam. That country ceased to exist in 1975 when Vietnam was reunified under Hanoi's control.   LOAD-DATE: February 2, 1995  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",February 1 1995 ,11
"      When Hanoi opened its first diplomatic office here last week, the chief of liaison was met with angry shouts from protesters. In the days that followed, however, the downtown suite of offices has filled up with flowers from American companies eager to do business with the former foe.  As Vietnam and the United States move gingerly toward full diplomatic ties, the strains of the past and the hopes for the future overlap awkwardly.  Le Van Bang, the chief of the new, six-person liaison office, describes his role as helping to tell America of how Vietnam has moved on since the Communists emerged victorious and unified the country nearly 20 years ago. As he shows a visitor around the rambling and largely empty downtown suite of offices, decorated with tapestries of pagodas and the orange and yellow Vietnamese flag, he stopped to read the cards from some of the floral tributes.  ""All these flowers are from American companies,"" said Mr. Bang. ""For instance, this one is from a company that clears mines from the ground.""  As Hanoi's representative to the United Nations for the last three years, Mr. Bang said that 80 percent of his time was spent trying to smooth relations between the United States and Vietnam. During those years, he traveled around the United States, meeting with Vietnamese-Americans, American business people and veterans' groups to promote the image of a new Vietnam.  ""I tell people about the new foreign policy to be friends with everyone,"" said Mr. Bang. ""Many are surprised when I tell them we are now a free market economy, that we encourage private ownership.""  It is also his job to help resolve the issue of Americans still missing in Vietnam.  State Department officials say lack of progress on the issue of American soldiers still listed as missing in action and other Americans unaccounted for remains the main stumbling block on the road to full diplomatic relations.  On Friday, a State Department official said that while the United States is heartened by Vietnam's increased cooperation, returning 61 sets of remains of Americans during the last year, ""the remains of 2,100 servicemen are still missing, and further steps towards diplomatic normalization will not continue unless there is tangible progress.""  Mr. Bang also tries to help Americans caught in Vietnam's red tape. One of the first phone calls he received in his new post was from a representative of the Vietnam Veterans of America, who was calling because he was having a problem securing visas for a delegation to visit Vietnam.  ""I intervened, and the next day they got the visas,"" said Mr. Bang.  Mr. Bang is swift to describe the warm relations he enjoys with groups like the Vietnam Veterans of America. But Paul Skogland, the group's executive director, stopped short of calling the increased diplomatic relations a positive development. ""Once something's a done deal,"" he said, ""we try to make the best of it.""  The opening of the Vietnamese liaison office on Wednesday coincided with the release of the State Department's annual report on human rights around the world. In the report, the State Department said that ""Vietnamese citizens did not have the right to change their government, or to assemble, associate or speak freely, and the Government continued to arrest and imprison people arbitrarily.""  Mr. Bang attributes the report's criticism to cultural and economic differences between the United States and Vietnam. ""Here the press criticizes the President openly,"" he said. ""Traditionally, in Vietnam, that is not acceptable.""  As for arbitrary arrests, Mr. Bang said: ""We still consider security a very high priority. If you are going to do something that causes disorder, we have to take care of that.""  Mr. Bang and his staff plan to move into the old South Vietnamese Embassy by March, as soon as renovations are completed. However, Mr. Bang anticipates that the move will only mean a change to more spacious quarters, not an increase in diplomatic stature.

"      They say they are the lost patrols of America's war in Vietnam: more than 50 Vietnamese commandos who worked in secret behind enemy lines for the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States military.  The commandos and more than 400 of their fellow spies were captured and imprisoned in the 1960's, Government records show. They survived for decades in forced-labor camps. Now they want to leave Vietnam, where they are reviled as traitors, and come to the United States.  The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service does not believe their stories and has rejected their applications, and a spokesman refused to discuss the case.  But recently declassified 25-year-old Pentagon reports strongly support their claims. So does the man who was the Defense Intelligence Agency's top analyst on prisoners of war in Vietnam. Now the United States Ambassador in Thailand has taken up the lost commandos' cause.  In a cable sent from Bangkok last month and distributed widely throughout the nation's intelligence agencies, the Ambassador, David F. Lambertson, said the former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst, Sedgwick Tourison, had presented ""specific and detailed information"" showing that the Vietnamese commandos were ""U.S. contract employees and that, prior to their capture, they were paid with appropriated U.S. Government funds.""  Mr. Lambertson, who was a Foreign Service officer in Vietnam from 1965 to 1968, said the Immigration and Naturalization Service should reconsider its rejection of the pleas for refugee status. The United States Embassy in Bangkok has long handled Vietnamese immigration and refugee issues.  ""We believe they qualify, based on their associations with U.S. policies and programs and serving long incarcerations,"" said the cable from the Ambassador.  It said the Vietnamese commandos were captured ""while engaging in U.S.-directed missions to collect intelligence, conduct military and psychological operations, or to render assistance to downed American air crews.""  A spokesman for the immigration service said tonight that he was unable to answer any questions.  As the 20th anniversary of the fall of Saigon approaches, old wounds are being reopened for many Vietnamese. None will be more painful than the lost commandos' story, said Mr. Tourison; he was chief of analysis of the Defense Intelligence Agency's special office for P.O.W.-M.I.A. affairs in the 1980's and a principal author of the final report of the Senate Select Committee on Prisoners of War/Missing in Action in 1993.  ""There is no doubt in my mind that these agents are who they claim to be, that they undertook the missions they say they did and that we, the United States Government, have known their fates since the mid-1960's,"" Mr. Tourison said in an interview. His book on the commandos, ""Secret Army, Secret War,"" is to be published in August by Naval Institute Press.  The former investigative counsel for the Senate committee on prisoners of war, John Mattes, who is preparing to file a suit in Federal Court seeking the captured commandos' back pay, said: ""While it is a tragedy that we left these P.O.W.'s behind, it's a national scandal that we would seek to deny their existence and to rewrite history to eliminate them.""  Mr. Mattes was referring both to the actions of the immigration service and to a long-secret, recently declassified Pentagon history of the commandos: the Macsog report, short for Military Assistance Command/Studies and Observations Group. He and Mr. Tourison said information about the commandos in the 1970 report was deliberately withheld from the Pentagon Papers, the official Government history of the Vietnam war.  ""This was the secret,"" said a senior official of the Clinton Administration who served in Vietnam in the 1960's. ""This was our pathetic and utterly unsuccessful effort to undermine the North Vietnamese.""  The Macsog report describes the commandos' experience as ""a one-way street with no hope of return.""  The commandos were a mix of South Vietnamese Army officers and civilians; many originally came from North Vietnam and knew the terrain and the dialects. The money came from the United States Navy's covert operations budget and was laundered by the C.I.A. through off-shore transactions.  ""Members of Congress didn't ask and the Navy didn't tell what the funds were used for,"" said Mr. Tourison, who has reviewed the Macsog report and interviewed retired C.I.A. officers who served in Vietnam.  McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, recalled the operations in an interview as ""a covert infiltration of specially trained Vietnamese.""  ""It didn't work,"" he said. Nearly all of the commandos were killed, captured or lost.  ""The program was a disaster,"" said Mr. Mattes, who has read the Macsog report. ""By '69 we had lost them all. The majority were captured alive, and we knew it. They were tried as war criminals and Radio Hanoi broadcast their sentences, up to 30 years. We went to their families and said, 'They're dead.' We wrote them off. We did nothing to seek their return or release. We kept the operation secret.""  The commandos slipped into North Vietnam by night on junks, sampans and speedboats, were parachuted in by the South Vietnamese Air Force, or were dropped by the C.I.A. from Air America planes into Laos to walk into the war zone.  And there they disappeared. The Macsog report lists 52 ""long-term agent inserts"" of teams as large as 17 commandos between 1961 and 1967. And it lists their fates:  ""Captured soon after landing.""  ""Hanoi Radio announced capture.""  ""Team destroyed.""  ""Last radio contact 2 Dec. '66.""  ""Team believed under North Vietnam control.""  ""Team reported in Laos again and ready for pickup. Could not locate.""  ""Captured soon after landing.""  ""Captured soon after landing.""  ""Doubled, played, terminated.""  That last phrase suggests that the United States discovered that a commando team was secretly working for North Vietnam, used the team to feed false information to the enemy and then killed its members.  In his memoir, ""Hazardous Duty"" (Summit Books), a retired Army major general, John K. Singlaub, says the United States Army delivered ""booby-trapped gift packages"" to the suspect teams, including ""time bombs or demolition charges set to explode when a carton of cigarettes was opened.""  The commando operations began as a C.I.A. effort no later than 1961; the Pentagon took them over in January 1964 under an ambitious covert program called OPLAN 34-A. The highest-ranking White House, State Department, C.I.A. and Pentagon officials knew of the missions.  In his new book, ""In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam"" (Times Books), former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara writes that the 34-A commando missions were ""essentially worthless,"" because ""most of the South Vietnamese agents sent into North Vietnam were either captured or killed.""  But he adds an intriguing mystery.  He says he met with President Johnson; Mr. Bundy; the Director of Central Intelligence, John McCone, and others after the Maddox, an American destroyer, was attacked by the North Vietnamese in the Gulf of Tonkin on Aug. 2, 1964 -- an incident that led to the dramatic intensification of the war. All present were aware that a 34-A commando raid had been carried out on two islands in the Gulf of Tonkin two days earlier.  The attack on the Maddox was ""so irrational,"" he writes, that ""some believed the 34-A operations had played a role in triggering North Vietnam's actions"" -- and thus in transforming a small, out-of-the-way conflict into a full-bore war.

"      The general yawn provoked in Vietnam by Robert McNamara's controversial mea culpa tells a great deal about the enduring difference between the American and Vietnamese relationships to the war.  In both Hanoi and Saigon, as the bustling southern city is still commonly called, the focus is on the present and future, not on the sins of the past. "" Vietnam is a country, not a war,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai is fond of saying. Mr. McNamara's tears are not Vietnam's.  Even tomorrow's 20th anniversary of the country's reunification (in Vietnam, it's the reunification, not the war victory, that counts) is seen as a minor distraction from the real business at hand -- that of becoming the next Asian tiger. Workers were building bleachers in the park in front of the old Presidential palace in Saigon last week for a parade, but almost nobody I met cared.  Vietnam today is in the business of business. Even Hanoi, the once sleepy outpost of post-colonial charm and Soviet collectivism, is a cauldron of capitalism. Everybody, everywhere, is selling something. From the soup stall to the high-rise construction cranes, the country resembles nothing so much as the unbridled free-market economies of the West or, better, of the Asian tigers Vietnam seeks so ardently to emulate. Hanoi is madly striking deals with international investors eager to rebuild roads, phone systems and the remaining machinery of a market economy.  Yet American businessmen find themselves handicapped in a game fueled by cash streams from Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and Australia. The lack of full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Vietnam, held up by the demands of the tiny missing-in-action lobby, cripples American companies by preventing them from using such key instruments as the Export-Import Bank. The consensus among Americans in Hanoi is that closer relations would foster closer cooperation and enhance the full accounting that M.I.A. lobbyists seek. President Clinton should break the impasse with a historic exchange of ambassadors with Vietnam.  Hanoi strikes the visitor as a surprisingly free and open place. I detected none of the dangerous electricity I always felt in the Moscow and East Berlin of old, where you knew the heavy hand of the secret constabulary was only a phone tap away. In Hanoi, men in uniform were few and far between; if anything, the city needs more cops on the street to manage the colossal traffic.  This climate extends to the flow of information. Local TV is heavily westernized. On my first night in town, I was stunned to see ""Apocalypse Now"" showing on the main channel. On other days, Oprah, Popeye, the Masters tournament and the N.C.A.A. final four -- the jewels of American popular culture -- washed over the doorman and drivers gathered before the TV set in my hotel lobby.  Though Government-controlled, the press is relatively uppity, reporting all manner of corruption, scandal and general incompetence. When the much admired Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's semiretired dictator and Hanoi's unofficial chief adviser, was in town this month, he publicly upbraided the Government of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet for ""your inability administratively."" He was impatient with continuing bureaucratic impediments to private investment and miffed at yet another power outage that had killed his mike and darkened the hall where he was about to speak. All this received front-page treatment in the press.  This does not mean Vietnam is free in larger terms. It is a one-party state with secret surveillance of those thought to be a threat. Some key Buddhist leaders are imprisoned, some intellectuals gagged or hounded, some harsh sentences meted out for the slightest show of dissent -- such as the 15 years given to a man named Pham Van Quang for waving the flag of the former South Vietnam during the 1992 Ho Chi Minh City international marathon.  Still, political repression is hardly a topic that's on everybody's lips. As best I could tell, in fact, it was on nobody's lips, unless I brought it up. The national preoccupation is economic, not political, and Vietnam is clearly a country on the make.  Nine years into doi moi, Vietnam's perestroika, the leadership is obviously doing something right. ""The Communists have succeeded,"" said my old anti-Communist friend Ly Quy Chung one day in Saigon. It was an extraordinary admission from a former opposition politician, now a journalist, who had battled both the Viet Cong and the U.S.-supported Government of President Nguyen Van Thieu in the 1970's.  He meant that his old enemies, after the ""10 dark years"" from 1975 to 1985, had now got it right, not merely economically but politically as well. By giving the people what they want -- the liberty to pursue economic happiness -- the Communist gerontocracy is able to keep what it wants: full control.  But many think Vietnam, opened to the West and electronically liberated by sidewalk fax and photocopy stalls, is slouching toward democracy. By putting the war behind them and eagerly grasping their future, the Vietnamese are able to forgive and forget and move forward. The question is whether America is ready to do the same.

"   , Vietnam, April 29   Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet of Vietnam said today that he shared the pain of the families of United States servicemen killed during the Vietnam War and urged both nations to put hatred behind them. He also repeated Hanoi's call on Washington to normalize ties.  Celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the war's end ""are not being held to recall hatred, but to urge American and Vietnamese people to look forward,"" he said after a meeting with Vietnamese leaders and veterans.  President Clinton has said progress on an accounting for servicemen still listed as missing will help determine the pace of normalizing ties.

"    CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, April 30   The Vietnamese Government celebrated the 20th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War today with bursts of fireworks and a grand parade through the streets of the city once known as Saigon, but without the spirit of unity that the Communist leadership has struggled to portray.  That Vietnam still has far to go in reuniting north and south was obvious in the barricades set up throughout the city, preventing all but Communist Party members and invited guests from watching a parade that brought together the aging soldiers who defeated a superpower.  There was heavy security along the parade route, apparently out of fear that opponents of the Government might use the anniversary as an opportunity for a protest in front of television cameras from around the world. There was no protest.  ""I feel very happy about this anniversary and the reunification of our country, but I feel bad because I cannot get to the parade,"" said Nguyen Hung, 42, an English teacher, who stood across the street from the former United States Embassy here, straining to catch even a glimpse of the parade, a camera around his neck.  ""The camera is useless today,"" he said with a smile of resignation.  Still, if the Vietnamese of the north and south have not yet made peace with each other, the country's leaders made clear today that they were interested in peace with their former enemy, the United States.  Their speeches to mark the anniversary were remarkably free of the venomous rancor about the United States that marked earlier anniversaries of the capture of Saigon -- renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the Communist victory -- and the end of a war that took more than three million lives, including those of 58,000 Americans.  Speaking from a grandstand within sight of the former Presidential Palace, where the Saigon Government surrendered on April 30, 1975, Mayor Truong Tan Sang spoke of the anniversary as ""a resplendent milestone"" for Vietnam but did not even once mention the United States, the archenemy of the Communist forces in fighting that lasted a decade.  On Saturday in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet recalled raids by American B-52 bombers, the massacre at My Lai and other ""genocidal crimes"" committed by the Americans during the war.  But at the same time, he urged the Vietnamese to ""shut the door to the past and look to the future to raise our national spirit, expand international relations and work together with other countries for peace, cooperation and development.""  Vietnam is eager for full diplomatic and trade relations with the United States, which last year lifted a 19-year-old trade embargo that had crippled the Vietnamese economy.  In January the United States opened a diplomatic liaison office in Hanoi but said it would not agree to full diplomatic relations until there was additional progress in determining the fate of more than 2,000 troops still listed as missing in action from the war.  Mr. Kiet was in Ho Chi Minh City today and watched the parade from the grandstand, seated alongside the legendary general of the Communist army, Vo Nguyen Giap, the ""Red Napoleon"" who defeated the French Army at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and was among the architects of the war against the United States and the American-backed Government of South Vietnam.  Before the parade, General Giap joined in laying wreaths before a statue of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's revolutionary leader. The general was dressed in a gray uniform adorned only with the Hero of the People's Army of Vietnam medal, the nation's highest military award.  ""The Vietnamese people have put this war behind them,"" said Michael Liscio, 52, a Navy veteran from Sherman Oaks, Calif., who was with the first American combat forces to land in Vietnam in 1965 and who today was invited to watch the anniversary parade as a guest of the Vietnamese Government.  Mr. Liscio, who last week completed a 1,300-mile, two-month run from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, said that after meeting with Vietnamese from all parts of the country, ""I think there is still a difference between the people in the north and the people in the south, just as there was a difference in the United States a hundred years ago after the Civil War.""  ""But now these people want peace,"" he added. ""Basically these people are not warriors -- they are warm, friendly people who want to move on.""

However, they did not say if the information would meet President Clinton's demand that Hanoi show progress in tracing missing Americans before relations could be improved between the two countries.  ""This is significant new information,"" said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State, after meetings here with Vietnamese officials.

"      Senior Administration officials have recommended that the United States establish full diplomatic ties with Vietnam, Administration officials said today.  But Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and other Republicans have introduced a bill to derail the proposal.  The question of normalizing relations flared anew on Tuesday after Vietnamese officials turned over a long-requested batch of documents about Americans missing in action.  Senior officials said there is increasing pressure in the Administration, especially within the State Department, to recognize Vietnam. They said that position is being pushed hardest by Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, but also by the President's economic advisers, especially Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown.  These officials and several people lobbying on the issue noted, however, that some National Security Council aides, notably Nancy Soderberg, chief of staff to the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, oppose the move because they fear it could hurt Mr. Clinton politically. Mr. Lake is leaning against full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, the officials said. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has not made up his mind, a senior aide said.  The question of recognition is one of the most emotional and delicate foreign policy issues the Administration faces. On one side are business groups worried about losing opportunities in the world's fastest-growing region and diplomats hoping to increase American influence as a counterweight to China. On the other are veterans' groups, the families of missing American servicemen and White House advisers who worry about reviving criticism of Mr. Clinton's avoidance of the draft.  The proposed Republican bill, co-sponsored by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, one of Mr. Dole's presidential rivals, said the President should not recognize Vietnam until it has provided full disclosure of all information about the 1,619 Americans missing in Vietnam.  Senator Robert Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who introduced the bill, said: ""I think the Administration definitely wants to normalize. I think it's on a fast track within the Administration.""  Proponents of normalization have also been scrambling in recent days to thwart that attack. Two decorated Vietnam veterans -- Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat -- maneuvered today to make it easier for Mr. Clinton to grant recognition by saying they would soon introduce a resolution calling on the President to recognize Vietnam -- a step being pursued by many business groups as well.  President Clinton lifted the two-decade-old trade embargo against Vietnam last year, after the Senate approved a bill that those two Senators had introduced calling for an end to the embargo.  ""For the sake of America, maybe it's time we ended the war,"" Mr. McCain, who spent seven years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, said in an interview. ""I believe normalization would be an important part of the healing process.""  Administration officials said no formal recommendation would be made to Mr. Clinton until a Presidential delegation, comprised of officials from the Pentagon, State Department, National Security Council and Department of Veterans Affairs, returns next week from a trip to Vietnam and other Asian countries.  Several officials said the President might grant recognition before Secretary of State Christopher visits Asia in July, well before the presidential campaign heats up. Others said they would not be surprised if the President played it safe politically and granted recognition after the elections in November 1996.  Mr. McCain and several Administration officials asserted that normalization is the best strategy to pursue the main goal of the United States: to gain the fullest possible accounting of missing Americans. Opening an embassy, they say, would insure continued cooperation from the Vietnamese and make it easier for Washington to investigate such cases.  But Senator Smith argues that the only way to gain the fullest possible accounting is by not granting Vietnam the biggest carrot -- recognition -- until it has provided full disclosure of all information on the M.I.A.'s.  Other sponsors of his bill include Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Mr. Smith insists that Vietnam is not close to providing all the information it has. ""It still refuses to release a lot of archival information,"" he said. ""We know based on our own intelligence that there is still information they can provide us on a number of cases.""  Under Senator Smith's bill, the President could grant recognition only after certifying that Hanoi has been ""fully forthcoming"" with information about missing servicemen.  When the Presidential delegation returns from Vietnam, it will analyze the more than 200 pages of analysis and documents Vietnam provided about missing Americans.  A senior State Department official said the view held by Mr. Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State, is that Vietnam deserves recognition because it has provided all the cooperation about missing servicemen that President Bush asked of it four years ago, when he laid out a road map of how it might win normalization.  ""The Vietnamese are clearly trying to demonstrate as much cooperation as they can,"" a senior official said.  According to the President's advisers, Mr. Clinton might approach normalization in several ways. Having agreed to exchange liaison offices last January, he might next decide to open an embassy and exchange ambassadors. Another option would be to announce recognition but send a charge d'affaires instead of a full ambassador. If Vietnam showed continued cooperation on M.I.A.'s, then a decision to exchange ambassadors would follow.  To pave the way for recognition, Administration officials said, the State Department will soon fix up a mansion in Hanoi for the first American ambassador. In addition, the United States is holding talks with Vietnam about human rights, and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gelbard will soon travel to Hanoi to discuss anti-narcotics efforts.  Corporate America is one of the major forces behind the push for normalization with this economically dynamic country of 75 million.  Major companies say normalization should include not just recognition but also preferential trade status. They also want the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to provide insurance for American companies doing business in Vietnam and the Export-Import Bank to provide low-cost financing.

"    Twenty years have passed since the North Vietnamese Communists won the Vietnam War, but Washington has yet to extend full diplomatic relations to Hanoi. With specialists satisfied that Vietnam is cooperating fully in the search for remains of missing Americans, President Clinton should take the advice of top aides and recognize Vietnam before 1996 election pressures encourage further delay.  The main obstacle has been manipulation of the prisoner-of-war issue by Republican politicians, beginning with Richard Nixon at the time of the Paris peace accords. Last week two Presidential aspirants, Phil Gramm and Bob Dole, joined Senator Robert Smith to propose legislation instructing the President not to normalize relations until Vietnam fully discloses all information about the 1,619 Americans still listed as missing in action.  That is a condition that is never likely to be met. The vast majority of names on the missing list represent probable combat fatalities in which no body was ever recovered. Vietnam today is doing all that can be expected of it in the search for American remains. Senator John McCain, himself a Vietnam prisoner of war for five years, concurs with this view and urges the Administration to normalize ties.  Vietnam, with more than 70 million people, has been pursuing market reform policies since the late 1980's and is now one of Asia's hottest markets for investment and trade. Delaying diplomatic relations keeps American businesses at a competitive disadvantage compared with their European and Asian rivals. Vietnam also serves as a potential strategic counterweight against an increasingly unpredictable China.  Normalization would have been politically easier for George Bush, a decorated World War II veteran who served on the Nixon Administration's national security team. Instead, Mr. Bush laid out a ""road map"" of steps for Vietnam to follow to win recognition. According to Senator McCain, among others, Vietnam has now substantially met all of Mr. Bush's tests. It deserves recognition in return.  LOAD-DATE: May 23, 1995  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",May 23 1995 ,11
"      Honoring veterans in Memorial Day ceremonies, President Clinton promised today to ""leave no stone unturned"" in accounting for prisoners of war and troops missing in action in Vietnam, and he praised Hanoi for cooperating in such efforts more ""than ever before.""  The President's remarks amounted to some of his most detailed -- and conciliatory -- comments on Vietnam, as his advisers debate whether the United States should establish full diplomatic ties with its former enemy as the next step in accounting for missing troops and pursuing trade and economic opportunities in Southeast Asia.  ""We have worked hard and made good progress,"" Mr. Clinton told veterans gathered in a tent on the South Lawn of the White House for the unveiling of a new first-class postage stamp honoring P.O.W.'s and those missing in action. ""We have put the issue of M.I.A. cases ahead of all others in our dealings with Vietnam, and today I am proud to say we are receiving more cooperation from Hanoi than ever before.""  The President did not mention the issue of recognition of Hanoi, and aides said later that they did not expect any immediate decision. Some of Mr. Clinton's diplomatic and economic advisers are pressing strongly to establish full diplomatic ties, arguing that recent disclosures of documents by Hanoi meet the criteria the Government has laid out during the last four years for normalization. But others are said to be wary, concerned that such a move could hurt Mr. Clinton, whose efforts to avoid service in Vietnam have dogged his political career.  ""I would not anticipate any decision in the next few days,"" said the national security adviser, Anthony Lake. He said the Administration was just beginning to review the latest batch of documents turned over by the Vietnamese this month to a delegation to Vietnam and Laos led by Hershel W. Gober, Deputy Secretary for Veterans Affairs.  Recognition faces considerable opposition from Republican Congressional leaders like Senator Bob Dole, though it is backed by a bipartisan duo of decorated Vietnam veterans, Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and by businesses anxious not to miss opportunities in the world's fastest-developing region.  Mr. Clinton said ""we can only imagine the pain"" that families of the missing have experienced, and added, ""We know very well our obligation to them and their families to leave no stone unturned as we try to account for their fate, and if possible to bring them home.""  In an appearance later before hundreds of other veterans at Arlington National Cemetery, the President placed a wreath of blue irises and red and white carnations at the white marble Tomb of the Unknowns, then bowed his head in silent prayer. He paid tribute to the victors of World War II by pledging in this 50th anniversary year to ""rededicate ourselves to the vision for which they lived.""  ""Generations before ours met challenges to democracy and freedom, defeated the threats of Fascism and Communism, and now it is for us to rise to the new challenges posed by the forces of darkness and disintegration in this age, at home and abroad,"" Mr. Clinton said, echoing language he has used in several contexts since the Oklahoma City bombing.  But he made no mention of the rising conflict in Bosnia that bedeviled his senior foreign policy advisers throughout the weekend as they reviewed options for dealing with the hostage-taking of United Nations peacekeepers there after NATO air strikes pressed by the Administration last week.

"      Twenty years after the war in Vietnam ended, President Clinton has concluded that the time has come to establish full diplomatic relations with the former enemy and may announce the decision as early as next week, senior Administration officials said today.  The President has not yet signed a formal order granting Vietnam full diplomatic recognition, which would be the United States' most important step towards burying the bitterness of the Vietnam War. But Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, is completing a draft order recommending the policy change, which is expected to be presented to the President within the next few days.  In preparation for the announcement, the White House has drawn up a list of leading lawmakers and foreign leaders who will be informed as soon as the President makes his formal decision. White House officials have also begun to prepare arguments that can be used to explain why the move is a necessary step in a four-year process begun by the Bush Administration to provide the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing in the Vietnam War.  The Vietnamese Government has not yet been informed of the President's intentions, a senior Administration official said. Nor has the White House chosen a candidate to become the first United States Ambassador to Hanoi.  The move to establish full diplomatic relations, which has been endorsed by Mr. Clinton's senior diplomatic, military, economic and political advisers, comes after more than a year of debate within the Administration on whether Vietnam has cooperated fully in determining the fate of 1,619 United States service personnel who are still listed officially as missing in the war.  Indeed, The Administration has been steadily moving toward the decision for months, approving quiet visits aimed at resolving problems and broadening ties between Washington and Hanoi.  Diplomatic relations between the two countries will have a direct effect on American companies by allowing them to receive United States-sponsored financing and insurance that will help them do business in Vietnam.  Administration officials acknowledge that establishing full diplomatic relations with Vietnam would be a reward for its cooperation with the United States in releasing documents about missing servicemen and returning the remains of servicemen killed in Vietnam.  Moreover, they said, they hope increased contact with the Hanoi Government may make the Vietnamese even more forthcoming.  ""We see this as the most effective way to meet our priority of getting the fullest possible accounting of those Americans missing from the Vietnam era,"" said one Administration official involved in the process.  ""Our experience shows that when you cooperate with Vietnam, you get more concrete results than if you just hold them at arm's length.""  In establishing relations with Vietnam, Mr. Clinton will inevitably face intense opposition from conservatives and veterans groups, who contend that such a move would betray his past promises to the families of missing servicemen and Vietnam veterans.  Mr. Clinton also faced criticism when he decided in February 1994 to lift the 19-year-old trade embargo on Vietnam. But that response proved politically manageable and quickly died down -- particularly because the move was widely seen as advancing United States business interests in Southeast Asia.  There was even less political fallout when Mr. Clinton opened low-level diplomatic relations with Vietnam shortly afterward, allowing an official representative of Hanoi to open an office in Washington.  There continue to be political risks for a President who agonized 26 years ago over avoiding service in a war he said he ""opposed and despised."" In recent weeks, however, White House aides have concluded that these risks are outweighed by the fact that there may be a higher political price to pay if he refuses to establish relations.  Mr. Clinton has received support on the issue from three decorated war veterans in the Senate -- John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat; John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Bob Kerrey, the Nebraska Democrat.  The three senators are poised to introduce an amendment to the State Department Authorization Bill next week urging that the United States grant Vietnam full diplomatic recognition, a nonbinding resolution that is expected to pass. A McCain-Kerry resolution calling for an end to the trade embargo was approved in a bipartisan 62-to-38 vote in January 1994, paving the way for Mr. Clinton to lift the embargo the following month.  On the other hand, two Republicans -- Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, and Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire -- plan to introduce an amendment to the same legislation that would withhold financing for an Embassy in Vietnam.  Senator Dole, the leading Republican candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, is scheduled to be the main speaker later this summer at the annual meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, a group that rejects the Administration's assertions that Vietnam is cooperating on the issue.  As a candidate for President, Mr. Clinton told the national convention of the American Legion in 1992 that he would not move toward establishing relations until he received the fullest possible accounting of Americans missing in action.  When he formally announces his decision, the President is likely to praise Vietnam's increasing cooperation over the years. He gave a preview in remarks on Memorial Day while presenting a new postage stamp commemorating prisoners of war and those missing in action in Vietnam. At that time he said Hanoi had been more cooperative ""than ever before."" Of the effort to account for the missing, he said, ""There is nothing like it in all the history of warfare.""  Setting up ties wit Vietnam may make it possible for Secretary of State Warren Christopher to visit Vietnam when he travels to Asia at the end of the month to meet with foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Vietnam is to join the group at this meeting, and Mr. Christopher wants to have the matter settled by then.  If Mr. Christopher then travels to Vietnam, he will be the first Secretary of State to visit the country since the American-backed Government in Saigon fell to Communist forces in 1975.  Publicly, Administration officials emphasized that Mr. Clinton had still not decided whether to establish relations, but was poised to make a decision soon. There is a reluctance to make such an announcement until veterans' groups and others opposed to the decision have been briefed.  ""This is now a question that will shortly be before the President,"" the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said today.  Mr. Burns said the Administration was still assessing new documents handed over recently by Hanoi concerning missing American servicemen. Last week the Defense Department called the recent case of documents the most informative to date on the outstanding cases.  But those who advocate recognition have pushed Mr. Clinton to announce it as soon as possible, and not wait until the 1996 Presidential campaign gets any closer. Some of these advisers have also argued that Mr. Clinton should get ahead of the issue by acting before the Senate takes up the issue on the floor next week.

"    To the Editor:  The United States has never had diplomatic relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam or its antecedents. It is therefore incorrect to state as you do that ""President Clinton has concluded that the time has come to re-establish full diplomatic relations with the former enemy"" (front page, July 7).  The United States did not recognize the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam when it was established by Ho Chi Minh in Hanoi in September 1945. When the Soviet Union and China recognized this government in February 1950, President Truman recognized the Government of the State of Vietnam headed by former Emperor Bao Dai.  The United States continued to maintain its consulate in Hanoi when the Democratic Republic of Vietnam occupied Hanoi in accordance with the Geneva armistice of 1954, but this consulate was accredited to the municipality of Hanoi, not the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.  It was closed in December 1955, when the authorities forbade the use of radio to communicate out, according to the oral history of the last consul, Thomas Corcoran, which is kept at Georgetown University.  Diplomatic relations were maintained with the State of Vietnam at successively higher levels of legation and embassy in Saigon, and then with the Republic of Vietnam, which succeeded it, until April 30, 1975, when the United States embassy was evacuated.

"      Following are excerpts of President Clinton's announcement today establishing full diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam:  Today, I am announcing the normalization of diplomatic relationships with Vietnam.  From the beginning of this Administration, any improvement in relationships between America and Vietnam has depended upon making progress on the issue of Americans who were missing in action or held as prisoners of war. Last year, I lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam in response to their cooperation and to enhance our efforts to secure the remains of lost Americans and to determine the fate of those whose remains had not been found.  It has worked. In 17 months Hanoi has taken important steps to help us resolve many cases. Twenty-nine families have received the remains of their loved ones, and at last have been able to give them the proper burial. Hanoi has delivered to us hundreds of pages of documents shedding light on what happened to Americans in Vietnam, and Hanoi has stepped up its cooperation with Laos, where many Americans were lost. We have reduced the number of so-called ""discrepancy cases,"" in which we have had reason to believe that Americans were still alive after they were lost, to 55, and we will continue to work to resolve more cases. . . .  Our strategy is working. Normalization of relations is the next appropriate step. With this new relationship, we will be able to make more progress. To that end, I will send another delegation to Vietnam this year. Vietnam has pledged it will continue to help us find answers. We will hold them to that pledge.  By helping to bring Vietnam into the community of nations, normalization also serves our interest in working for a free and peaceful Vietnam in a stable and peaceful Asia . . .  Our policy will be to implement the appropriate United States government programs to develop trade with Vietnam, consistent with United States law. As you know, many of these programs require certifications regarding human rights and labor rights before they can proceed. . . . The Secretary of State will go to Vietnam in August where he will discuss all of these issues, beginning with our P.O.W. and M.I.A. concerns.  I believe normalization and increased contact between Americans and Vietnamese will advance the cause of freedom in Vietnam just as it did Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. I strongly believe that engaging the Vietnamese on the broad economic front of economic reform, and the broad front of democratic reform, will help to honor the sacrifice of those who fought for freedom's sake in Vietnam. . . .  This step will also help our own country to move forward on an issue that has separated Americans from one another for too long now. Let the future be our destination. We have so much work ahead of us. This moment offers us the opportunity to bind up our own wounds. They have resisted time for too long. We can now move on to common ground. Whatever divided us before, let us consign to the past. Let this moment in the words of Scripture, ""Be a time to heal, and a time to build."" Thank you all. And God bless America.

"      The wonder is not that the United States is establishing normal diplomatic relations with Hanoi, two full decades after the fall of Saigon; the wonder is that it took so long.  Presidents have come and gone since those final apocalyptic scenes of a long, wretched war -- the American Ambassador fleeing from Saigon with the embassy's flag folded under his arm, the fevered scramble for the last seats on the last helicopter out. Neither Gerald R. Ford nor Jimmy Carter nor Ronald Reagan nor George Bush could bring himself to recognize the government that Washington had demonized for so long, though Bush started down the path.  Instead, fate chose an unlikely pair of men: Bill Clinton, liberal Democrat, who like many thousands of his contemporaries managed to avoid fighting in a war that never won the full-hearted support of the American people, and John McCain, conservative Republican, son and grandson of admirals, who not only fought as a Navy pilot, but, shot down, spent more than five years in an enemy prison camp.  President Clinton provided the political impetus, Senator McCain of Arizona the political cover without which Mr. Clinton might have feared to act.  There were other key players as well, notably American business, eager for its share of the riches that Vietnam, its talented people and its offshore waters seem to promise, and American diplomats, who see friendship with Vietnam as an important asset for the United States as it seeks to counter Chinese influence in Asia.  The conventional explanation for the delay was the difficulty in accounting for the Americans still carried on military rolls as missing in action. According to the Pentagon, there are 2,202 of them if you count all of Southeast Asia, 1,618 if you count only Vietnam. Of that total, only 55, by official tally, are known to have been seen alive in captivity at some stage.  But the real reason lay much deeper within the national consciousness.  Far, far more Americans are listed as missing in the Korean War (8,170) and in World War II (78,750).  Yet no one ever suggested it would be possible to account for more than a handful of them -- not to mention the hundreds of thousands of north and south Vietnamese whose fate remains unknown.  A few years after World War II, the United States was engaged in huge rebuilding efforts in Germany and Japan, even though Germans had killed millions of Jews and Japanese had tortured prisoners on a vast scale.  The difference, of course, is that the United States lost in Vietnam. It is never easy for the big guy to shake hands after losing the fight to the little guy, especially when he has never lost before, and so it was after the Vietnam War. The open wound of defeat was salved, for some Americans, by continuing to regard the Hanoi Government as an evil, outlaw, untouchable regime.  The resentment over the loss of so many American lives and the stunting of so many others, combined with the unresolved confusion and controversy over the purpose of the war itself, made it possible for the relatives and friends of some of the missing Americans to delay, but not ultimately to prevent, this last acknowledgment that the war is truly over, that it is time, as President Clinton suggested today, to move beyond ""the haunting and painful past.""  Not everyone will agree, of course.  A group called ""The Last Firebase,"" composed of veterans and relatives of the missing, said that ""today will forever be known by America's veterans as Black Tuesday."" The American Legion opposed the decision, and so did Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination next year.  It was ""a strategic, diplomatic and moral mistake to grant Vietnam the stamp of approval from the U.S. Government,"" Senator Dole asserted.  But the most recent survey of American opinion suggests strongly that he and other critics of the President are in a distinct minority. A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll shows 61 percent of the public backing recognition and only 27 percent opposing it.  Mr. McCain's support is invaluable to Mr. Clinton, because he is by far the best known of the survivors of the infamous ""Hanoi Hilton."" He not only endorsed the President's action but said ""it required some courage.""  So is the backing of Jan Scruggs, who was wounded in Vietnam and later sparked the creation of the black granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall here. His comment was laconic: ""The war is over, so let's be friends."" And so is the backing of some veterans' groups, like the Veterans of Foreign Wars.  It may be that many Republican primary voters, a more conservative subset of the more conservative party, are more opposed to Mr. Clinton's action than are Americans as a whole. Mr. Dole's stance may play well with them.  But the steps along this road that Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton took earlier, including the lifting last year of a 19-year embargo on trade with Vietnam, failed to produce the groundswell of protest that the die-hards predicted. And Vietnam is now clearly a land of opportunities, which will inevitably draw much more American investment and many more visits by American tourists.  As a web of everyday political and economic links grows between the United States and Vietnam, as more and more Americans come to know Vietnam at peace, the old passions, already nearly spent for most Americans, will seem increasingly irrelevant. Normality is the enemy of grudges and hatreds.  At any rate, the deed is done. Congressional threats to withhold money for an American embassy in Hanoi are likely to come to nothing. Mr. Clinton acted just as the question of full diplomatic ties was beginning to be sucked into the vortex of the 1996 campaign. He could not have waited much longer, and by moving now, he may benefit from looking resolute on a tough issue.  Reminiscing this morning with a reporter he has known since the days of air raids over Hanoi and ground combat in the Central Highlands, Senator McCain commented that he was determined that his generation not leave a legacy of anger and vindictiveness.  ""I got over the war about 45 minutes after the plane bringing me home took off from Hanoi,"" he said.  ""But not everyone feels that way.  Some people hate me for backing this, call me the Manchurian Candidate, say I'm a collaborator, the most awful stuff. There will always be people like that, but fewer and fewer. Not many people talk about the dirty Japs anymore.""  LOAD-DATE: July 12, 1995  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: News Analysis                      ",July 12 1995 ,11
"    In 1968, Ann Holland learned that her husband, Tech. Sgt. Melvin Holland, was missing in Laos -- leaving her, at 28, with five young children to raise.  ""Since then, I've gotten up every day, and asked God to help me get through the day, and some days have been worse than others,"" said Ms. Holland, who lives in Ocean Park, Wash. ""This is a pretty bad one.""  What made yesterday bad for Ms. Holland, and thousands of other Americans whose family members remain unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, was President Clinton's announcement that the United States would establish full diplomatic relations with Vietnam.  The Government says that Vietnam is cooperating in the search for remains of missing Americans, and that it does not believe any of the missing are still alive in Southeast Asia. But for Ms. Holland and many others with lingering questions about the fate of their husbands, fathers, or sons, yesterday's announcement brought both a sense of betrayal and new worries.  ""If there are any prisoners left alive, and I believe there are, they will probably be killed now, because they will no longer be an asset to the Vietnamese,"" Ms. Holland said. ""President Clinton has sold our men for 30 pieces of silver. He doesn't have a brother or a father missing over there, or even a friend, because he never served. But for people like me, it's something that will never go away.""  The fate of the more than 2,000 servicemen whose whereabouts remain uncertain has been a touchy issue since the war ended, as family members joined together in groups like the National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Missing Servicemen and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, to win public sympathy and Government support for their quest.  Just how many Americans remain to be found is a matter of dispute. Of the 2,202 people unaccounted for, about 1,600 are missing inside Vietnam, and the rest in Laos, Cambodia or China. Most experts believe that very few of those who disappeared -- perhaps 55 in Vietnam, and 100 more in the other countries -- had any chance of surviving the incident in which they disappeared.  All groups opposed rapprochement with Vietnam. But their reactions to the announcement varied from resigned to bitterly resentful.  Colleen Shine, a member of the board of the National League of Families, took pains to stress the signs of hope that she observed at the Clinton Administration briefing on the normalization.  ""The families have been realistic from the get-go, and it won't do much good to cry over spilt milk,"" said Ms. Shine, whose father, Lieut. Col. Anthony Shine, disappeared in 1972 on the border between Vietnam and Laos. ""We've got to work with what we've got. I was most impressed with the acknowledgment that there are more things that can be done, that the Clinton Administration is committed to the fullest possible accounting. The Vietnamese could unilaterally account for hundreds of Americans. The answers to our questions do not go away because of this decision, and hopefully the President is right and the Vietnamese will cooperate more fully.""  Dolores Alfond, of the National Alliance of Families, and sister of an Air Force pilot shot down over North Vietnam in 1967, was not invited to the briefing -- and was far more caustic about the new policy.  ""This is a betrayal,"" she said. ""Clinton promised in 1992 that he would never normalize relations with any country that withheld information."" She said the Administration ""is more interested in helping big business than in finding these men.""  She and others were scornful of the Administration view that normalization might mean more cooperation from Vietnam in locating missing servicemen, given that few sets of remains were returned since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo last year.  Many of the children of missing servicemen said they felt a special betrayal because they had been brought up to believe in the military.  ""I was raised military, and I know these are America's fighting men, the best in the country,"" said Elizabeth Stewart, whose father, Col. Peter J. Stewart, was shot down over Dien Bien Phu on March 15, 1966, when she was 11. ""What Clinton has done is to betray these men, and every man and woman who ever wore a uniform. It's pure politics, pure lies. President Clinton says we've reached a new level of cooperation, but I say sure, a new low. The Vietnamese are warehousing bodies, and they won't give us access to the prisons.""  Ms. Stewart said she expected normalization to produce less cooperation, not more: ""Before the embargo went up, we had a letter saying we could go anywhere we wanted in Vietnam and stay as long as we wanted, but one week after the embargo was lifted, they threw me out of the country because I wanted to go to the underground prison in Vinh Phu province, a military security zone, where we have reports from multiple sources that there are American prisoners.""  Many families said the decision was precipitous.  ""I really feel it was premature,"" said Trudy Terla of Silver Spring, Md., whose husband, Capt. Frank Terla, has been missing since 1969. ""The Vietnamese could be more forthcoming unilaterally with what they know.""

"      Republicans in Congress bitterly attacked President Clinton today for extending full diplomatic recognition to Vietnam and accused him of selling out the families of Americans missing in Vietnam.  In a first Congressional hearing on the President's decision on Tuesday to establish relations -- 22 years after the American withdrawal from the war -- Republicans on the House International Affairs Committee spoke with unusual passion in asserting that President Clinton was in an unseemly rush to recognize Vietnam even though it has not provided a full accounting of the 1,618 Americans missing there.  Representative Dan Burton of Indiana called the decision ""a blot, a stain on our Government,"" while Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey said it ""dishonors veterans."" Representative David Funderburk of North Carolina called it ""tragic"" and said it ""ignored a clear campaign promise"" not to recognize Vietnam unless it cooperated fully in turning over information about missing servicemen.  Indeed, some Republicans were so upset that Representative Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairman of the House committee, threatened to take the highly unusual move of sponsoring legislation that would bar the use of Federal funds to open an embassy in Hanoi.  Such a move, Republicans argued, could press Vietnam to provide more information about missing Americans. But Administration officials said they were confident that Congress would defeat such a bill out of deference to the executive branch's traditional prerogatives over establishing diplomatic ties.  As evidence that Vietnam has not cooperated fully, Mr. Gilman said Hanoi had not returned the remains of at least 94 servicemen who he said Americans know through documents, photographs and broadcasts were captured during the war. Other lawmakers noted that the Vietnamese seem to dribble out information every time a high-level American delegation visits Hanoi, a development they say indicates the Vietnamese give information only when it suits them.  Despite the criticism, Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord defended the decision to recognize Vietnam, telling the committee it ""was based on effective Vietnamese cooperation which has led to progress on P.O.W./M.I.A. accounting.""  Mr. Lord said Vietnam has recently turned over hundreds of documents about missing Americans and has allowed investigators to scour Vietnam's countryside for the remains of servicemen. He also praised Vietnam for furnishing information over the last five years enabling Washington to resolve the cases of 141 American soldiers who had disappeared in Vietnam.  ""The President determined that further tangible progress could best be promoted through closer bilateral ties,"" Mr. Lord said, noting that recognizing Vietnam had far more support among the public than among Congressional Republicans.  Nonetheless the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, James Wold, told the committee he doubted that Vietnam had furnished every shred of information.  In one of the hearing's emotional high points, Representative Randy Cunningham, a California Republican whose plane was shot down over Vietnam when he was a Navy pilot, burst into tears and had to interrupt his testimony as he described how several of his friends died in his arms in Vietnam. He said it was wrong to recognize Vietnam, which he accused of killing American prisoners and systematically withholding records and remains from Pentagon officials investigating missing Americans.  ""This is not a political issue for me,"" he said. ""This is right and wrong.""  The Republicans sought to do their best to damage the President on an issue on which they believe he will be vulnerable in the 1996 election.  Representative Robert Dornan, a California Republican, said Vietnam has not turned over the remains of up to 400 American prisoners, who he asserted were being held in a warehouse in Vietnam. But Mr. Lord said that while Vietnam apparently warehoused some remains during the war and immediately afterward, the Administration believes all remains that were kept in warehouses have been handed over.  Although most of the witnesses were against the Administration, several Congressman applauded the President for establishing relations.  Representative Pete Peterson, a Florida Democrat who was a prisoner of war for six and a half years in Vietnam, said he was convinced that only through improved ties with Vietnam could the United States obtain the fullest possible accounting of those still listed as missing from Vietnam.  The opposite view was taken by Representative Sam Johnson, a Texas Republican who was a prisoner of war for seven years. He asserted that by establishing diplomatic ties, the Clinton Administration was forfeiting whatever leverage it had to press Vietnam to produce more information about missing Americans.  ""For the friends and families of American M.I.A.'s yesterday's decision was a slap in the face,"" he said. ""By taking this action, we are giving away the store and the Vietnamese are off the hook.""  LOAD-DATE: July 13, 1995  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 13 1995 ,11
"   , Vietnam, July 27   Military investigators have identified human remains found in Vietnam as belonging to four American servicemen missing in action since the Vietnam war.  A spokesman in Hanoi for the joint search force working to identify remains said two sets of remains had been identified as those of Capt. Jack P. Dove, of Bluefield, Va., and Lieut. Col. Boyd Squire, of Sacramento, Calif. The spokesman, Maj. Randall Garrett, said the men were crew members on a T-28 aircraft shot down over Vietnam on July 12, 1967.  A third set was identified as those of Col. Joseph Chestnut, of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who was the pilot of a T-28 that crashed on Oct. 13, 1970, during a night mission over Laos.  The identity of the fourth serviceman is being withheld at the request of relatives.

"   , Thailand, July 28   Vietnam was admitted today to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the first Communist nation granted membership since it was founded 28 years ago, in part as a bulwark against Communism.  The admission of Vietnam is a critical step in Hanoi's integration into a region that includes most of Asia's fastest-growing economies. Its membership was formalized at a ceremony in which the Vietnamese flag was raised at the association's annual ministerial meeting, in Brunei.  The association, known by the acronym Asean, was founded in 1967, at the height of the Vietnam War, to promote political and economic solidarity among the non-Communist nations of the region.  But today it seems well on its way to becoming a partnership of all 10 nations in the area. The association has emerged as the premier diplomatic grouping for the region, and it has championed the creation of a free-trade area early in the next decade.  Only Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, formerly Burma, are not yet full members, and their inclusion appears to be only a matter of time. The military junta that runs Myanmar announced on Monday that it would take the first step toward membership.  Vietnam and its non-Communist neighbors still have broad ideological differences. But the other members appear willing to overlook them for now in hopes of cooperation in trade and investment.  Vietnam's rapid economic growth -- about 8.8 percent in 1994 -- and an educated, low-wage work force have made it an attractive market for foreign investors, especially since the United States ended the trade embargo it imposed at the end of the war.  At today's ceremony, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, signed the association's membership declaration as foreign ministers of the other member nations watched. ""You are just across the water from us, and for too long we have been distant strangers,"" Foreign Minister Mohamed Bolkiah of Brunei told the Vietnamese.  It has been a heady summer of diplomatic triumphs for Vietnam, which won full recognition from the United States earlier this month. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to participate in the summit talks in Brunei next week and then travel to Hanoi, the first American Secretary of State to visit Vietnam in 25 years.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 4   With sun-leathered hands that once clutched an army rifle on the jungle battlefields of Vietnam, Nguyen Dinh Tuyen now holds a paint bush and a bucket of off-white paint. His employer today, the United States Government, was his enemy in that long-ago war.  ""The Americans killed 40 of the men in my army unit, and it was wartime, so certainly we fired back on the Americans,"" said Mr. Tuyen, 38, a veteran of the People's Army of North Vietnam who saw not the slightest irony in the fact that today he was helping spruce up a building that will be converted into a United States Embassy in Hanoi.  ""The war was so long ago,"" he said, making long brush strokes against a wall that will be the backdrop for a dedication speech by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrives in the Vietnamese capital on Saturday for a three-day visit. ""We have forgotten the war. We have moved on.""  Mr. Christopher's imminent arrival in Hanoi, less than a month after President Clinton announced that the United States would establish full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, has been trumpeted for days with banner headlines in Vietnamese newspapers.  This nation has not received such a high-ranking American official in more than two decades. In 1973, Henry Kissinger, then the national security adviser and later Secretary of State, visited Hanoi after signing the Paris peace accords.  Mr. Christopher will arrive here a celebrity to millions of Vietnamese who have been told that his visit marks not only the beginning of diplomatic relations with a former enemy, but also the end of generations of international isolation for a proud but battered nation.  ""We had normalized relations with all the countries of the world except America, and now there is friendship with America, too,"" said Bui Thanh Son, a researcher in American affairs at the Vietnamese Institute of International Relations. ""We are finally recognized again as a full member of the world community.""   On Sunday, Mr. Christopher is to dedicate the new embassy and watch as the American flag is raised above it. Nguyen Thi Tuyet, a 43-year-old merchant whose tiny jewelry shop is next door to the new embassy, has been planning what she will wear for the ceremony.  ""I will wear my finest silk dress -- it's a pretty shade of blue -- and I will put on my most beautiful white high heels,"" she said breathlessly. ""This is not just an important day. This is history for Vietnam, so I must be properly dressed.""  While most Vietnamese admire the United States for its affluence, they also know of its continuing struggles with violence and racism. The race riots in Los Angeles were an important news event here given that millions of Vietnamese have family members among that city's large migrant population.  ""The reason we must have good relations with the United States is because it is such a powerful country -- in technology, in science,"" said Truong Huu Vy, a 60-year-old tailor who would seem to have more reason than many Vietnamese to be wary of closer ties to the United States.  His tenement home on Kham Thien Street in Hanoi was destroyed in an American bombing run over the city late one night in June 1972. Dozens of his neighbors were killed, their bodies stacked in the street until they could be carted away in wheelbarrows. ""Women and children -- the bombs did not care,"" he said.  Mr. Vy's wife and children survived only because they had chosen to sleep that night in a back room of the tailor shop. ""We were lucky,"" he said. ""We could not understand why the Americans would bomb a civilian street.""  Still, he said he welcomed the return of Americans to Vietnam, and without any reservation. ""In 1972, a lot of people here would say they hated Americans, but you would not hear that anymore,"" he said. ""What matters is not the past. All that matters is the present and the future.""

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 5   Declaring an end to ""a decade of war and two decades of estrangement,"" Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived here today to open formal diplomatic relations with the Communist leaders of Vietnam, and immediately plunged into talks about turning a former enemy into an emerging trading partner.  In a day constantly haunted by images of a war from which neither side has fully recovered, Mr. Christopher began his visit by witnessing the return of fragmentary remains of four American servicemen who were among the 58,000 who died here. More than a million Vietnamese also died.  ""A generation ago, the trauma of war bound together the history of our nations for all time,"" he said, standing against the austere backdrop of ""Thud Ridge,"" the mountain range where scores of American pilots were shot down as they flew bombing runs on Hanoi. ""Let us now lay our past of conflict to rest, and dedicate ourselves to a future of productive cooperation.""  Those were the words the Vietnamese have waited years to hear, and by midday -- over a luncheon at which his hosts conspicuously served California wine -- there was already talk of trade and tax treaties and investment incentives. The Vietnamese were so eager for quick accords that Mr. Christopher had to send his top economic deputy, Joan Spero, to explain that such agreements can take months or years to draft, and will require major changes in Vietnam's economy.  ""They took copious notes,"" Ms. Spero said later. ""They are beginning to understand this will be a detailed process,"" one that many in Congress will oppose and that many others will insist include specific requirements for vast improvements of Vietnam's dismal record on human rights.  Today there were already signs that the country's leaders would stiffen at any such conditions: Vietnam's urbane Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, said at a signing ceremony with Mr. Christopher, at an ornate colonial-era guest house, that a key to the new relationship would be ""non-interference in each other's internal affairs.""  As Mr. Christopher moved through the center of this increasingly chaotic capital, which is gradually being restored to its old French graciousness, there still seemed to be two Vietnams living side by side: the ideological state that continues to decorate its parks with statues of Lenin, and the bustling, motorbike-choked streets that have brought a vibrancy to this city that was markedly absent just four years ago.  The conflicting images are everywhere. Mr. Christopher met tonight with Vietnam's President, Le Duc Anh, just blocks from the simple wooden house in which Ho Chi Minh and his successors prosecuted the war and wrought political havoc half a world away in America.  The house has been carefully preserved, and both Vietnamese and foreigners visit it daily to see the simple long table where Ho met his generals. A single ancient-looking telephone sits at the end, near his seat, to dispatch commands.  But if the Vietnamese are preserving Ho's home, they are racing to tear apart the other remnants of the war, betting that the documents signed today will clear a wider path for investors. While Mr. Christopher was signing the formal documents establishing diplomatic relations, workers a few blocks away were in the last stages of knocking down one of the city's most notable landmarks, the Hanoi Hilton, where American fliers and other prisoners of war were held for years.  ""John McCain's cell was over there, but it was knocked down already,"" Pham Tu, an official of the cultural affairs ministry, said today, referring to the Arizona Republican Senator whose support of diplomatic recognition helped give President Clinton the political cover he needed to make the move.  Where the prison once stood, a group of local and foreign investors is building two office towers, one 23 stories high and the other 13, making them among the tallest in the city. The block that became a symbol of the terrors of Vietnam is to contain a hotel, a supermarket, a parking lot and offices. A few cells are being preserved in the front as a museum.  To Mr. Christopher, this was a day heavy with history: no American Secretary of State has ever visited Hanoi (though Henry A. Kissinger came here as national security adviser in 1973), and none have set foot anywhere on Vietnamese soil in the quarter of a century since William Rogers traveled to Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, now named Ho Chi Minh City.  Acutely aware that many veterans and relatives of the missing consider Mr. Clinton's diplomatic recognition of Hanoi a betrayal, the Administration carefully orchestrated Mr. Christopher's first day here to focus on the efforts to account for the 1,615 Americans still listed as missing in Vietnam.  ""Every one of them is a cherished human being with a name and a family and a nation that cares and this endeavor is a reflection of that deep caring we have for every one who goes into battle,"" he said at a news conference.  The Vietnamese leaders, while promising continued cooperation on the prisoner issues, made it clear that their focus is intently on the markets and on making up for time lost when America's trade embargo sharply limited the country's ability to grow. They see trade and tax treaties with the United States as the surest way to reassure international investors, and thus the path to building the kind of foundation that turned Thailand and Malaysia into economic powerhouses.  But they want to do so on the Singapore model: letting free markets bloom, but with minimal challenges to central political authority. By some accounts they were perturbed by President Clinton's observation last month that trade benefits often ""require certification regarding human rights and labor rights before they can succeed.""  It was a subject that Mr. Christopher was not anxious to discuss at length today, perhaps for fear of putting a damper on the celebration. ""Today's normalization gives us an added basis for having a human rights dialogue,"" he said, adding that his Chinese counterpart was ""ready to proceed down that road.""  ""The main thing is that the trend be in the right direction,"" he said. ""I don't want to give a letter grade"" to Vietnam on human rights, he said, presumably a reference to the country's sharp controls on press freedom and political opposition.  ""This is a great day in Vietnam. We shouldn't miss the significance of this day.""

The Vietnamese were so eager for quick accords that Mr. Christopher had to send his top economic deputy, Joan Spero, to a separate meeting to explain that such agreements can take months or years to draft, and will require major changes in Vietnam's economy.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 7   The American flag finally flies in Hanoi now, over a new embassy that symbolizes the end of the argument in Washington over whether and when to recognize Vietnam. Hanoi, stultifying and lifeless just five years ago, is suddenly the new magnet for entrepreneurs seeking one of the few frontier cities left in Asia.  Gracious but decrepit French town houses are suddenly fetching prices in the millions, and already ads for Carrier air conditioners and Caterpillar tractors are popping up in villages that American pilots once bombed.  But as the visiting American delegation, led by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, discovered over the last few days, it is hardly a foregone conclusion that the logic of economic self-interest will now bind together once-bitter enemies.  A generation after the war ended, Washington is once again out to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese -- this time to persuade them to privatize their desperately inefficient state-run industries, allow free emigration, adopt labor policies assuring minimum rights of workers and create an independent legal system that will give foreign investors recourse to the courts. Without those steps, Mr. Christopher and his aides told Vietnam's leaders, Hanoi will get few of the economic benefits that it hoped would flow quickly from diplomatic recognition by the United States.  Clearly such requirements are already viewed as a threat to many in the Government here, whose leaders harbor dreams of transforming their country into a far larger version of Singapore: a booming free market, combined with strict political control.  Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, said on Saturday that the key to the new relationship between Washington and Hanoi would be ""noninterference in each other's internal affairs."" If they had not known before, Mr. Cam and his colleagues discovered in the last few weeks that American foreign policy has changed a lot since the days of the Vietnam War. With the cold war ended, Washington these days is far less concerned with domino theory than with deregulation and open markets, and that often means involving itself in a trading partner's economic and social policy.  So on Sunday, a day after signing the accord formally establishing diplomatic ties, Mr. Christopher was already beginning to lecture his hosts that nothing short of radical change in their domestic economy is needed to prosper in trade with the United States. ""I would ask you to look at economic reform as a passage over a ravine,"" he said. ""You cannot do it by taking several little steps; only one giant leap will get you across.""  A senior Administration official involved in Asian policy said here the other day: ""The hard part of the relationship is just beginning. I think the Vietnamese had a lot of expectations that after the political relationship was established, the floodgates would open. The reality is that it's going to be slow going, and we're concerned that their very high expectations could turn into a very negative reaction.""  Vietnamese officials are already chafing that after an initial burst of enthusiasm, American companies, which have been permitted to invest here since February 1994, have only trickled in. To step up the pressure, they have begun conspicuously awarding contracts to non-American bidders, and the Vietnamese Communist Party chief, Do Muoi, just returned from a tour of Australia and New Zealand, which are actively seeking a slice of the market here.  The old Hanoi, a dour place that once seemed to lack the energy that marked Ho Chi Minh City, has been vanquished. A visitor here five years ago had a hard time finding anything open past the dinner hour. But this weekend, the streets were still jammed at 11 P.M. Small stores were selling compact disks and audio tapes -- almost all of them pirated copies, some being copied in clear view on hundreds of whirring tape decks -- along with Samsung microwave ovens and Sony televisions.  Five years ago, bicycles ruled the roads of Hanoi, making the Vietnamese capital one of the handful of Southeast Asian cities spared, chiefly by poverty, the choking pollution and unrelenting development that has overtaken places like Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. The streets are now noisily alive with the roar of the Honda ""Dream,"" a motor scooter that has become so popular on the streets here that it is almost a cliche.  ""It's quite a snappy model,"" observed Mr. Christopher, not a man ordinarily known to enthuse about such things, after a tour of the city.  But Vietnamese officials understand that what they need is foreign investment, not imports. So while Mr. Christopher was raising flags and talking to college students over the weekend, the State Department's top economic official, Joan Spero, was holed up with Vietnam's powerful Chairman of State Planning, Do Quoc Sam, offering a quick rundown of how a country like Vietnam gets a credit rating and what it must do to meet Congressional requirements for preferential trade status.  ""At one point he looked up from his pad and asked me, 'What about human rights?' "" Ms. Spero recalled of her meeting with Mr. Sam. ""He took a lot of notes -- no reaction, just copious notes.""  Vietnamese officials are clearly eager to please on the regulatory requirements: Tax and investment laws are already being issued here so fast that no one seems quite certain what they say. Privatization of state industries is a far more complicated issue, because much of the political control over the country is based on the state ownership of factories, land and agricultural products. So instead of ""privatization,"" Government officials here are using another term, ""equitization."" It suggests that they will sell some equity in the state industries, but retain majority control.  What Vietnam lacks today is the presence of anyone in the higher reaches of its Government with a working knowledge of international commerce. ""We have been isolated for so long,"" a senior official of the Foreign Ministry said, ""that we don't even have economists.""  Vietnam's other problem is likely to be the Republican-controlled Congress in Washington. Getting a trade treaty passed -- the first step before any other significant agreements can be negotiated -- and securing most-favored-nation status for Vietnam will require Congressional approval.  Already, human rights advocates and others who say the Clinton Administration has played down Hanoi's continued repression of dissidents have begun pressing for inserting human rights requirements on any accord with Vietnam. Some in the House, in early votes on the Federal budget, have sought to deny funds to operate the United States Embassy in Hanoi, and Administration officials fear that it could take months to win confirmation of an American Ambassador to Vietnam.  Over the weekend, Mr. Christopher announced that he would appoint a longtime Asia hand in the State Department, Desaix Anderson, to act as charge d'affaires. Mr. Anderson, one of the department's leading Japan experts, speaks Vietnamese and was stationed in South Vietnam as an adviser at the height of the war. He later became the director of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodian affairs in Washington.  LOAD-DATE: August 9, 1995  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: News Analysis                      ",August 9 1995 ,11
"    Twenty years after the fall of Saigon and one month after President Clinton established diplomatic relations with Hanoi, Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Vietnam last weekend was an important step in the painful process of reconciliation. Mr. Christopher set just the right tone on a journey he said he had long hoped to make.  There would normally be nothing unusual about a Secretary of State visiting the capital of an East Asian country of 70 million people that eagerly courted American investment and was a leading military power in a region made nervous by recent Chinese belligerence. In this case, no United States Secretary of State had ever gone to Hanoi before.  The President's decision to open an American Embassy in Hanoi, which was the formal occasion for Mr. Christopher's trip, serves national interests and was long overdue. But it remains opposed by some Republicans in Congress, who now stubbornly threaten to withhold funds for operating the new embassy.  Veterans' groups worry that Washington may slacken its efforts to learn more about Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War. Human rights groups are nervous that the Administration is getting too cozy with one of the world's few remaining Communist police states.  Mr. Christopher used his principal public speech in Vietnam to address these legitimate concerns. He reminded his audience of young Vietnamese foreign service trainees that determining the fate of missing Americans remains Washington's primary concern with Hanoi and that continued progress on this issue will be the key to a closer relationship.  On human rights, he insisted on a formal government-to-government dialogue, and appealed positively to Vietnamese self-interest, pointing out that economic growth is usually smoothest when accompanied by the rule of law and creative freedom. Directly addressing the young Vietnamese before him, he defined America's ideal of freedom and human rights with simple eloquence. ""Each of you,"" he said, ""ought to have the right to help shape your country's destiny, as well as your own.""  In separate meetings with government officials, his aides pointedly noted that many of the special economic benefits Vietnam seeks from the United States, including preferential trade status and subsidized loans, depend by law on human rights performance.  Hanoi's culture of political repression is deeply entrenched. Foreign companies have found their activities plagued by bureaucracy, copyright piracy and an unreliable legal system. For these and other reasons, diplomatic and economic relations between America and Vietnam are unlikely to progress as rapidly or smoothly as Vietnamese authorities hope. But Mr. Christopher has gotten them off to a sound and principled start.  LOAD-DATE: August 9, 1995  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",August 9 1995 ,11
"   , Thailand, Aug. 17   Rejecting protests by the United States and human rights groups, Vietnam has announced that the nation's most prominent dissident monk will go on trial on charges of ""sabotaging religious solidarity.""  The trial date for Thich Huyen Quang, 77, has not yet been announced, but foreign diplomats in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, said it could begin within days.  His conviction, they said, is almost certain given that his 68-year-old chief deputy was found guilty of similar charges after a one-day trial and sentenced this week to five years in prison.  Diplomats and human rights groups said the timing of the trials may be linked to last week's visit to Hanoi by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the highest-ranking American to visit Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War.  Mr. Christopher, whose visit marked the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the former enemies, urged Government officials in Hanoi to end its harassment of dissidents, including religious leaders who oppose tight controls on religious groups. Vietnamese officials responded by telling the United States not to meddle in Vietnam's internal affairs.  The State Department has expressed concern both over the treatment of the monks and over the prison sentences imposed last week on a group of Vietnamese human rights advocates, including two Vietnamese-Americans.  Hanoi's leaders clearly fear that the monks of the Unified Church of Vietnam, who have a long history of public protest, could be a threat to the stability of the Government, just as they helped topple American-backed Governments in South Vietnam in the 1960's and 1970's.  The Unified Church and other independent Buddhist groups were banned by Vietnam in the 1980's, and the Government created a single, state-sponsored umbrella federation called the Vietnam Buddhist Church to oversee all Buddhist worship in the country. The Unified Church refused to disband, however, and its leaders have repeatedly criticized Vietnam's Communist leadership over its human rights record.  A report Wednesday from the official Vietnam News Agency said Thich Huyen Quang, who is the patriarch of the Unified Church, and the church's third-ranking official, Thich Long Tri, would both go on trial on criminal charges of undermining ""religious solidarity."" The report did not cite the possible penalties faced by the two monks.  On Monday, the second-ranking official of the church, Thich Quang Do, and five other members of the federation were given prison sentences after a one-day trial in Ho Chi Minh City on charges of ""undermining the policy of unity,"" a national crime under Vietnam's criminal code.  Thich Quang Do, a writer and scholar who is the Secretary General of the Unified Church, received a five-year sentence, while the others were given prison terms ranging from two-and-a-half years to four years. The prison term of one of the defendants, a lay Buddhist woman in poor health, was suspended after she asked for leniency.  After a separate trial last week, nine other Vietnamese human rights advocates, including two Vietnamese-Americans, were sentenced to prison terms of 4 to 15 years for their part in an organization that called itself the ""Movement to Unite the People and Build Democracy.""  The nine defendants were arrested in November and December 1993. According to the Vietnam News Agency, they were charged with ""acting to overthrow the people's government"" by producing political documents.
