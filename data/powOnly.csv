"      China said today that growing tension along its border with Vietnam and the deteriorating situation in Indochina had made it impossible to resume peace talks with Hanoi.  The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a Vietnamese proposal issued on Sept. 12 that the talks, which were broken off in March after eight months of fruitless negotiations, be resumed in Hanoi on Oct. 6 was ''nothing but a trick for propaganda purposes, an attempt to deceive world opinion.''  The Chinese turned down the Hanoi proposal, saying that the Vietnamese are bent on hostility toward China and aggression in Indochina, particularly toward Cambodia. The statement said Hanoi ''does not have the slightest sincerity'' about a negotiated settlement.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 23 1980 ,2

"      After six hours of talks with Hanoi officials, four American veterans of the Vietnam War expressed hope today that the emotional issue of the 2,500 United States servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia could be resolved in the near future.  Robert O. Muller, executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, the leader of the visiting group, urged the Vietnamese to invite the United States to send personnel to assist in the search for the missing Americans. Such a step would ''substantially improve'' Vietnam's relations with the United States and ease the ''logistical burdens'' that the Vietnamese claim to have in hunting for the remains of the servicemen.  Most of the 2,500 servicemen missing in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are believed dead, although anguished American families believe that some of them remain alive as prisoners of war. Reagan Administration officials believe that the Vietnamese Government has been uncooperative in the search for the missing Americans, although the Hanoi Government insists that there are no American prisoners of war alive in Vietnam, and all remains have been handed over to the American side.  Vo Hoang, director of the Vietnamese office in charge of finding missing Americans, said that the ''logistical problems were enormous'' in terms of sending out helicopters and search parties to jungles to hunt for the remains. Mr. Hoang told Mr. Muller that there was ''considerable hostility'' in villages to search parties looking for Americans.  Interested In American Proposal  ''The village people ask why are we doing this for the Americans,'' Mr. Hoang said. ''Why do we dwell on the past? Why don't we build the future?''  Nonetheless, Mr. Muller, a 36-year-old former Marine, said that the Vietnamese ''viewed with interest'' his group's proposal to send Americans to Vietnam to join the search.  ''This type of move would remove a very clear obstacle to the development of relations between Hanoi and the United States,'' Mr.  Muller said. ''We told them that, and they knew it.''  The Vietnamese, in a meeting with the four Americans who are here unofficially, also promised to allow more Vietnam War veterans to visit the country.  ''I get the distinct sense that the Vietnamese want to have good relations with the United States Government,'' Mr. Muller said.  Other members of the group who are visiting Vietnam for six days are Michael Harbert, a former Air Force sergeant, Tom Bird, an infantryman during the war with the 1st Air Cavalry Division and John Terzano, a former Navy seaman. All are members of the Vietnam Veterans of America.  Several Blunt Exchanges  The group has held several blunt exchanges with Vietnamese officials and has had some internal bickering and conflicts. This morning, for example, the group reluctantly agreed to acquiesce to a Vietnamese request to lay a wreath at the tomb of Ho Chi Minh, but only after asking the Vietnamese to bar photographs.  The veterans themselves, traveling around the city in Russian-made limousines to meet Vietnamese officials, express a range of emotions as they gaze at Vietnamese families pedaling bicycles over the streets.  ''Its so quiet, and the primitive level of everything here is stunning,'' Mr. Muller said. ''When you see this place it's almost obscene to think what we dumped on these people. There's nothing here.''  Mr. Harbert said that the ''standard opening lines of rhetoric at each meeting about United States imperialism'' disturbed him.  ''I don't like it,'' he said. ''I'd like to reply. They've done some pretty nasty things too.'' Mr. Bird, who is currently director of the Veterans Ensemble Theater in New York, said ''a couple of years ago I would have been given a medal for shooting some of the people I'm meeting with.''  ''It blows my mind,'' he went on.  ''What a crazy world this is.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 21 1981 ,2
"   , Vietnam, Dec. 22   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told visiting Americans on Monday that Vietnam would welcome specialists who wanted to study the impact of the herbicide Agent Orange used during the war.  At the conclusion of a 90-minute meeting with four American veterans of the Vietnam War, Mr. Thach embraced each one of them and said: ''We are all victims; we are not enemies.''  In his remarks, he charged that the Reagan Administration remained hostile toward Vietnam and he denied that the Vietnamese were withholding information about the fate of 2,500 Americans missing in action.  He said Hanoi would henceforth deal on the issue with the Vietnam veterans' group and not with Washington.  ''The Vietnamese Government will cooperate with you on the missing in action on a humanitarian basis without any conditions,'' he said.  ''We will cooperate with you, not with Reagan and the Administration. They have repaid our humanitarian activity with hostility.''  One of the Americans, Robert O. Muller, who is executive director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said later that he ''welcomed this new initiative.'' He said his group would deal with Vietnam's mission to the United Nations.  Mr. Thach, who spoke in English, welcomed the visitors by saying: ''The way for friendship is very long. The way for war is very short. The American people must come to know the Vietnamese people.  We must cooperate with one another. Tell your people that, between Vietnam and the American people, there was no victory or defeat. We were all victims. It was a war of Johnson and Nixon against the American people.''  Mr. Muller, a former Marine officer crippled in the war, said the ''priority issues'' were the question of the missing in action as well as the problem of the herbicide, which was sprayed as a defoliant in South Vietnam and may cause cancer and birth defects.  Mr. Thach agreed to Mr. Muller's suggestion that American physicians and scientists come to Vietnam to assess the impact of the herbicide. Mr. Muller said his aim was to use the possible findings in connection with claims by veterans that they and their offspring had been affected.  Mr. Thach said, ''We will cooperate with you,'' but he added that the Vietnamese Government would grant visas only to investigators who were ''independent and not connected with Reagan.'' Mr. Muller assured him that there were people not connected with the Government who would come.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 23 1981 ,2
"    Four American Vietnam veterans walked through the looking glass last week and got a glimpse of what the war had been like on the other side. Whether their visit to Hanoi achieved much toward their main goal - clarifying the fate of 2,500 Americans still listed as missing in action - was questionable.  But they said it did help them come to terms with their lingering feelings of anger, guilt and fear.  ""The war finally stopped in my mind,"" said former infantryman Tom Bird.  The sight of a Soviet MIG-21 perched atop the wreckage of an American B-52 in Hanoi war museum brought it all back for former Air Force Sgt. Michael Harbert, much as the mothballed World War II bomber did for Dana Andrews in Frank Capra's film, ""The Best Years of Our Lives.""  Mr. Harbert burst into tears.  ""I haven't cried in 14 years,"" he said. ""It's the face-to-face reality of seeing that MIG, with its 14 stars meaning it shot down 14 planes . . . They are proud of it, but I guess they have a right to be, but it just upset me.""  The veterans also met with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach.  He asked them to serve as a liaison with Hanoi, with which Washington has no diplomatic relations, to help resolve the issue of the missing-inaction.  Some anguished American families believe that some of the missing are still being held as prisoners.  Hanoi denies this and also says that it has turned over all remains of American servicemen that it has found.  The Vietnamese Foreign Minister also said Vietnam would admit American doctors and scientists not connected with the Reagan Government to assess the effects of Agent Orange, a defoliant blamed by veterans for severe health problems.  The Americans, members of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said they were aware that their visit might be used for propaganda in Vietnam and attract bad publicity at home.  The Vietnamese remarked on the friendliness of the Americans, who strolled the streets passing out candy and chewing gum to children, for all the world like they were still G.I.'s.

"    The Vietnam War is over, but hostilities continue. The intemperate words ''fraud'' and ''total disgrace'' are being unjustly flung at four Americans for becoming the first Vietnam veterans to journey to Hanoi. The accusers do not speak for the United States; they are an embittered remnant who should not be allowed to add sense and humanity to the war's casualty list.  The Reagan Administration endorsed this trip, for America has an interest in finally resolving the fate of 2,500 servicemen missing in action. That cannot be done without Vietnam's cooperation. Since Hanoi has resisted official inquiries, the Administration plainly sees nothing disgraceful in trying another route. The State Department counseled the four Americans, all members of the middleof-the-road Vietnam Veterans of America.  Vietnam may be telling the truth in insisting that it is withholding nothing on M.I.A.'s. But it will take persistent and urgent inquiries before survivors are persuaded. To cry fraud or to refuse any contact with Vietnam won't bring back the missing. Neither will it help determine how lasting is the damage caused in Vietnam by Agent Orange, another matter of passionate concern to the war's veterans.  Plainly, Hanoi had a wider purpose in inviting the American veterans. Economically hard pressed, and eager to lessen its dependence on the Soviet Union, it hopes for better diplomatic and trading relations with the United States. But the chief obstacle remains: the Vietnamese Army still occupies Cambodia.  What also remains is the Vietnamese delusion that Americans somehow oppose their own Government's policy and, out of guilt, want to make one-sided amends by normalizing relations. Who better to dispel that delusion than Americans who fought in Vietnam?  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  TYPE: Editorial                      ",December 29 1981 ,2
"   , N.Y.   An American flag waves above the front lawn in the breeze. Inside the modest house, the floors are crowded with filing cabinets and cartons bulging with photocopies of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Departments of State and Defense.  One wall bears a huge map of Southeast Asia, with scattered sites circled in red ink. Aging photographs of a dark-eyed and short-haired young man in uniform stare solemnly from tabletops and mantels.  ''Nick was 38 on May 18,'' said Gladys Brooks, her tone conversational and matter-of-fact, but she and her husband, George, have not seen their son in more than 11 years. His bomber was shot down over Laos in January 1970, and aside from one early report - that Lieut. Nicholas Brooks had survived the crash, had been captured and escaped twice -he has not been heard from since.  But Mr. and Mrs. Brooks believe that he may be alive in one of those places ringed with red ink on the map, held with other American soldiers in Communist camps. For 11 years, the Brookses and hundreds of other members of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Action in Southeast Asia have waited and hoped. They have also worked to keep the issue of their lost loved ones from vanishing with other memories of the Vietnam War that many prefer to forget.  'The Deep-Freeze Treatment'  In the early years, the Brookses recall, they were honored at the White House, serenaded with stirring renditions of ''The Impossible Dream'' and lauded by the President and Secretary of State for their patriotism. But when the war ended for the United States in 1973, Mrs. Brooks said bitterly: ''All the doors were closed. It was the deep-freeze treatment. This is such a cover-up it makes Watergate look like child's play.''  ''The Government doesn't have the solution, so they don't want to make it known that there is a problem,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''It is too much trouble to try to get these men out, it's not politically feasible, so they just want to submerge the whole thing and wipe the slate clean.''  Two years ago, the Government changed Lieutenant Brooks's status from ''missing in action'' to ''presumed killed in action,'' although there was no new evidence concerning his fate. Until last week, the Brookses and many of the other families of the missing say, the Government had not cooperated with their attempts to discover what happened to the more than 2,500 American servicemen still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.  But last week, a group of C.I.A.-trained Laotians were sent on a secret mission into Laos to investigate evidence from spy satellite photographs and other sources that Americans might be held in a Laotian prison camp. After photographs taken by the group were examined by Government photo interpreters, Henry Catto, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, announced that ''absolutely no credible evidence of the existence of any M.I.A.'s'' had been found.  Began Inquiry on Own  ''We know it's a lie, but there isn't a damned thing we can do about it,'' said Mr. Brooks, who is 62 and an engineer.  Three years ago, frustrated by the Government's inaction, the Brookses began their own investigation. They placed advertisements in Vietnamese and Laotian-language publications around the world requesting that refugees with any information about American prisoners contact them.  The letters have flooded in ever since, with more than 1,000 reports of various kinds, including 317 purported eyewitness sightings of American prisoners. Some of the reports are as recent as early this year, and the stories told by the refugees are chilling.  A Laotian wrote that three Americans had been held prisoner in a cave in Laos: ''They were arrested by the Communists and were kept there. One American was captured 12 or 13 years ago.'' Another Laotian told of 50 Americans ''guarded by the Lao Communist military'' and said that ''sixteen persons were serious sick and the others are sick.''  'We're Pragmatic People'  Such reports have spurred the Brookses to persevere. They spend all their free time - nights, weekends ''and I haven't had a vacation in 11 years,'' said Mr. Brooks - analyzing the flow of information, cataloging the reports and poring over the documents they have obtained from the Government.  ''Our interest is in the whole group of men, not just our son,'' said Mr. Brooks, a World War II Navy veteran who was missing in action after his ship was torpedoed in the Mediterranean. ''We're pragmatic people. We know people get killed in wars. But it's the not knowing that hurts. I'm not saying my son is alive. What I'm saying is that I don't know that he's dead. We have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Americans are still being held over there. But it just seems like nobody gives a damn.''

"      Today, more than 14 years after he was listed as missing in action over North Vietnam, Comdr. Ronald W. Dodge of the Navy was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.  His family wept as three volleys fired by an honor guard shattered the quiet above his final resting place. The mournful, distant sound of taps brought back memories of long-ago, happier times.  Commander Dodge's remains, with those of two other pilots missing in Vietnam, were turned over to American authorities two weeks ago by the Vietnamese Government. The burial provided an answer, at last, to the question that had been nagging Janis Dodge and her children since May 1967.  Their ordeal ended, in a sense, at 3:30 this afternoon, as a band played ''America the Beautiful,'' Mrs. Dodge stepped forward and laid a single yellow rose on the silver-gray military coffin wherein rested all that was left of Ronald Dodge.  Ordeal of Families Goes On  But for the families of the 2,456 servicemen still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia - the so-called MIAs -the ordeal goes on. Many of the families are beginning to wonder whether there ever will be a final answer to the question that, for them, will not go away: ''Is he still alive?'' During Commander Dodge's funeral, the chaplain seemed to look to the heavens for an answer, calling on God to ''grant Thy great mercy on all MIAs.''  Officials of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia place primary blame for the long delay on Vietnamese authorities. They call the Vietnamese callous, cruel and unconcerned. But the league also asserts that American officials have not done enough.  ''The U.S. Government really hasn't scratched the surface on this thing,'' George L. Brooks, a league director from Newburgh, N.Y., said as he watched gravediggers lower Commander Dodge's coffin into a grassy hillside behind the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  ''They'e got about 30 people working on it when they should have 300,'' he added. ''But I'll admit that under Reagan they're doing more than they used to.''  Officer Reported Seen Alive  Mr. Brooks is the father of Lieut. Nicholas Brooks, a Navy pilot whose A-6 jet went down over Laos on Jan. 2, 1970. Mr. Brooks speaks of him in the present tense - ''he's 38, now'' - because the family has been told that some Laotians saw the lieutenant alive on the ground.  The official position of the State Department and the Department of Defense is that almost all of the missing men are ''presumed dead'' since combat ended for Americans almost a decade ago.  Government officials assert, further, that all that can be done is being done to persuade the Vietnamese to find and return bodies.  Privately, some Government officials have serious doubts that all of the men are dead. At least one behind-the-lines search mission reportedly has been mounted - it apparently turned up nothing - and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe, recently told Congress he was ''personally'' convinced that some were still alive because of the stream of ''live sighting'' reports from refugees. As a result of those reports, the Defense Department's staff concerned with the missing has been doubled, to about three dozen people.  Military Authorities Working  ''We work at it constantly,'' said Lieut. Col. John Fer, of the Air Force, the Defense Department's principal adviser on missing-inaction affairs.  ''We send a constant stream of information and questions to the Vietnamese,'' he continued, ''but they mainly approach it on a 'Don't call us, we'll call you' basis.''  Thus far, after eight years of intermittent meetings and discussions, the remains of 78 servicemen have been returned. Besides the body of Commander Dodge, a native of Olympia, Wash., who would have been 45 years old last month, the latest turnover included the remains of Capt. Richard H. Van Dyke of the Air Force, a pilot from Salt Lake City, and the remains of Lieut. Stephen O. Musselman of the Air Force, a pilot from Texarkana, Tex.  Defense Department officials said the death certificates accompanying the bodies asserted that the men had died when their planes went down. No other information was provided, not even an explanation as to what happened to Commander Dodge, who was photographed alive after being downed. That picture appeared in many publications in the late 1960's, and both lifted and depressed the Dodge family.  The denial of information ''is the same sort of thing the Vietnamese did with the French after they pulled out of Vietnam,'' Gladys Brooks, Lieutenant Brooks's mother, said this afternoon. ''It just tears at you.''  However, officials of the League of Families report that most relatives of missing men are not suffering serious psychological or economic hardship. ''The military has death benefits and all that and a lot of the children were too young when their daddies went down to remember much,'' said Carol Bates, the league's director of public affairs.  What Was Dad Like?  ''But,'' she added, ''how do you reorder your life if you don't really know whether your husband is dead, or how do you grow up without wondering a lot what your dad was really like? That's what's happening. They're the things that are bothering people.''  The wondering has intensified even more as refugees and other travelers continue to bring out reports. '' League officials say they have been told privately by officials that some of the people providing information have passed lie detector tests on their stories of seeing Americans held in jungle camps.  ''We've even got a good report that they're holding 400 bodies in Hanoi,'' George Brooks said as he left Commander Dodge's gravesite.  The coffin had been lowered into a vault and the sound of another firing squad was echoing off the hillsides.  ''Will I ever see Nick again?'' he asked, musing as a fresh summer rain fell. ''I don't know. I don't know whether he's alive. Worse, I don't know whether he's dead.''

"    To the Editor:  With regard to your Dec. 30 editorial ''Apocalypse Forever?'' pertaining to the four Vietnam-era veterans who recently visited Hanoi, I am amazed at The Times's naive view of both the veterans' and the Communists' motives for the trip.  The Reagan Administration certainly did not endorse this Penthouse magazine-sponsored trip. It was simply that t here was no way to stop it. Thus the veterans were briefed by both th e State and Defense Departments, to acquire a quick education on the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue and be cautioned against being used for propa ganda by the Vietnamese.Members of Congress familiar with this issue provided similar counsel, as did the National  League of P.O.W./M.I.A. Families.  While the league certainly welcomes help and support from concerned Americans, it is frankly appalling that Robert Muller and his associates have yet to contact our organization to brief us on the results of the trip, particularly since one of their alleged issues was accounting for the 2,500 missing Americans.  The Times is erroneous in attributing credibility to Hanoi's claims that it possesses no information on the missing. There is convincing evidence that live Americans are still being held in Vietnam, and there is valid intelligence data to prove that the Vietnamese are currently warehousing the remains of over 400 Ameri-cans. The group was briefed on this evidence by the Defense Intelligence Agency, rendering Mr. Muller's parroting of Communist denials even more astounding.  P.O.W./M.I.A. families have no desire to prolong the war; we simply want to know what happened to our men. Hanoi has answers and our Government will eventually have to deal directly with them to resolve the issue. Giving Mr. Muller the benefit of presuming his stated motives to be valid, the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue is a serious problem and there is little room for amateur diplomats.

"   , Vietnam, May 29   Vietnam released information today about four American soldiers who were believed killed in the Vietnam War and said more bodies of dead soldiers would be returned to the United States.  The information was given to a group of six Vietnam veterans and three other Americans who arrived in the capital Friday.  The Hanoi Government also announced that in the future it would deal with the veterans' group, and not with the United States Government, on questions involving 2,500 American servicemen whose fates in the Vietnam War are still unresolved.  Names Listed for 4  A Vietnamese spokesman gave the names of four Americans who had been listed as missing in action in Vietnam and said that the bodies of four or five other Americans had been found.  Only one of the eight or nine reported sets of physical evidence included both a body and an identity card. The body was said to be that of Lieut. (j.g.) Donald Patrick Frye.  The Vietnamese Government said Lieutenant Frye was believed killed on July 19, 1967, in the province now known as Ha Nam Ninh, south of Hanoi. The province is the product of a merger of the former provinces of Ha Nam and Ninh Binh.  Three other American servicemen, whose identification cards but not bodies were turned over to the veterans, were listed as Joe R.  Mossman, Hestle Roosevelt and Knapp Fredrick Woodrow.  No Information Provided  The Vietnamese provided no other information except to say that the three name tags were found in the three provinces of Ngha Tinh, Bac Thai and Binh Tri Thien.  Bac Thai Province is north of Hanoi. Ngha Tinh and Binh Tri Thien Provinces are along a central strip of Vietnam, from north of the city of Vinh to a few miles below the former South Vietnamese city of Hue.  A Vietnamese spokesman said that ''three or four'' other unidentified bodies had been discovered in Ha Nam Ninh Province and that another body believed to be that of an American had been found in Quang Ninh Province, which stretches northeast from Haiphong to the Chinese border.  It was not clear when the bodies would be turned over to the veterans.  Vietnamese Cites Ingratitude  The last bodies of American soldiers to have been turned over by the Vietnamese were three that were returned to the United States last July. Vietnam's chief negotiator with the veterans, Viet Ngo Minh, said today that the ingratitude shown then by Washington had helped persuade Hanoi to deal with the veterans rather than with Washington.  The veterans were invited by the Vietnamese Government on a weeklong visit after a similar trip last December. The announcement about the return of the bodies was made to a small number of Western newspaper and television reporters after a closed three-hour meeting between the veterans and the Vietnamese.  The reporters were granted visas to cover the veterans' trip.  Mr. Minh said the bodies were discovered in the last few months, after a United States Defense Department team left Hanoi last February. The team, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, came to Hanoi to inquire about Americans missing in action. It left with an agreement that the Vietnamese would send experts to Hawaii to study the technical aspects of identification.  Mr. Minh said today that the experts might still go to Hawaii in August.  The American veterans and their lawyer and the theatrical producer Joseph Papp, who joined the trip to promote cultural exchanges between Vietnam and the United States, were later received by Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach.  Mr. Armitage's mission was not received by Mr. Thach.  ----  U.S. Accepts Hanoi's Move  Special to the New York Times  WASHINGTON, May 29 - The Defense Department issued a statement today in reaction to the report that the Hanoi Government planned to deal with the veterans' group on matters concerning the fate of missing American servicemen.

The meeting in the Laotian capital of Vientiane ended a two-week visit to Laos and Vietnam by a four-member delegation from a private Washington-based group searching for information on American soldiers missing in action. The group is to arrive here Monday.  Ann Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families, said her group asked the Laotians to increase search efforts. ''The talks were very friendly, open and very sincere,'' Mrs. Griffiths said, adding that no commitments were given by the Laotians.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 27 1982 ,2
"      Mary Rose of Birmingham, Ala., still wakes up in the middle of the night and imagines that her son, Capt. Scott Ketchie, is alive in a prison camp in Vietnam.  ''He was a navigator on an A-6, shot down in 1972 over the Ho Chi Minh trail,'' Mrs. Rose, who is no longer married to Scott's father, said quietly. ''The pilot was rescued, parachuted out of the plane with Scott. But Scott was never found.'' She shrugged. ''Death is final, I could live with that, but Scott was my only child and, well, I guess I'll wait and hope forever.''  In the corner of a crowded lobby in the Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel, Patricia Maves of Portland, Ore., stood with her 11-year-old daughter, Camille. The girl was only 8 months old when her father, Capt. Richard A. Brett, was shot down over Laos while serving as a pilot on an F-111.  ''It's living with the uncertainty that's so hard,'' said Mrs.  Maves, who remarried recently. ''I think there's a possibility that some men may be alive somewhere, but not Richard. The uncertainty became too much for me and I guess I just decided that Richard had died.''  Kept Asking for Her Father  She said slowly, ''When Camille was 3 or 4 she kept asking for her father and I told her he was probably killed but nobody really knows and she said she was going to find him. Well that just tore me up. It brought up a lot of pain.''  The two women were among more than 500 relatives of Americans still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia who gathered today for the start of a two-day meeting to mark the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Paris peace accords that ended United States participation in the war in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The meeting today was marked by a speech by William P. Clark, President Reagan's national security adviser, and an updating of reports on the fate of the missing given by officials of the sponsoring organization, the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.  The Air Force flew many of the relatives to Washington from 19 bases around the country and will fly them home Saturday without charge.  The mood of the wives and children and parents of the missing was often anguished. ''I doubt seriously that my husband is alive,'' said Susan Miller of Corpus Christi, Tex., whose husband, Curtis, an Air Force major, was shot down in an AC-130 over Laos in 1972. ''I would just like to see him back in Texas soil.''  Reports Treated Warily  Although officials of the organization insist that ''eyewitness reports'' and ''sightings'' by refugees indicate that some men are alive - and that the Vietnamese are withholding the remains of more than 400 Americans - Reagan Administration officials speak warily of reports about American prisoners still being alive in Southeast Asia.  Maj. Bob Shields, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the Department of Defense ''operates on the assumption that some could be alive.'' He added: ''We don't have evidence that there are some alive, we don't have evidence that there aren't. But we have to press on as if some were alive.''  Mr. Clark, in his speech today, said, ''Information now in our possession disallows us from ruling out the possibiity that Americans are still being detained against their will.'' Mr. Clark noted that President Reagan would speak to the group on Friday, a decision that buoyed many of the families who assert that the Reagan Administration has shown far more interest in the issue than did the Carter and Ford Administrations.  ''We not only care deeply about our missing men and you, their families, but we are devoting our highest priority resources to the task of obtaining the release of any prisoners who may still be held, the fullest possible accounting of those missing, and the repatriation of remains of those who died serving our nation,'' said Mr. Clark.  Warning From Several Speakers  Vietnamese officials, including Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, have insisted that the Hanoi Government has retained neither American prisoners nor American remains, and that a substantial number of those listed as missing appear to have disappeared in jungle areas difficult to reach.  At meetings today, several speakers, including Mr. Clark, warned families against providing money - as some apparently had - to groups or mercenaries who said that they had seen American prisoners alive in Vietnam and were planning to rescue them in what the national security adviser termed ''private cross-border forays.''  ''Our experience is that such private groups operate under faulty intelligence,'' said Mr. Clark, who added that unscrupulous people sometimes take advantage of bereaved families.  After the speech and through the afternoon, many of the families drove to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial across the Potomac to examine the names of their fathers and sons. Kay Marker of San Antonio was planning to visit the memorial with her two children, Jeff and Suzanne, who were 3 years old and 15 months old when their father, Michael, an Army captain, was shot down in a reconnaissance aircraft in the demilitarized zone in March 1971.  ''He's not alive, I'm sure of that,'' said Mrs. Marker softly.  ''The children didn't even know their father. We just want him back, we want his body back.''  50 Amerasians Leave Vietnam  HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, Jan. 27 (AP) - Fifty Amerasian children and their relatives left Vietnam en route to the United States today.

"      President Reagan today told families of American servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia that United States intelligence agencies were ''fully focused'' on the problem and that the goal of a full accounting was ''the highest national priority.''  ''The anguish you've suffered - the families of brave men listed as prisoners of war or as missing in action - is unspeakable, something the rest of us can never really know even in partial measure,'' Mr. Reagan said in an emotional meeting with more than 500 relatives, including wives, children and parents, of the missing Americans.  Appearing at a meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, Mr. Reagan stood in front of the bleak black flag of the organization and received a standing ovation when he said: ''Your vigil is over. Your Government is attentive and the intelligence assets of the United States are fully focused on this issue.''  Mr. Reagan's appearance at the meeting in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Crystal City, Virginia, near Washington, and the tone of his comments underlined his strong involvement since the late 1960's in the issue of Americans missing in action in Southeast Asia.  Mr. Reagan said that the ''full resources'' of the Government were committed to the goal of a full accounting of the 2,494 Americans who remained unaccounted for after the Vietnam War.

"      The Reagan Administration has become concerned that privately organized expeditions into Indochina in search of missing United States servicemen may upset delicate talks with Laos and Vietnam on efforts to recover more remains of Americans lost during the Vietnam War.  At least one armed expeditionary force, headed by a former United States Special Forces officer, entered Laos in recent months in search of Americans rumored still to be alive and held captive. The foray was unsuccessful and has been denounced by Laos, as well as Thailand, the country from which the expedition was mounted.  United States officials say that other forays have taken place and that they periodically receive rumors that still more expeditions are being planned. Families of missing men report having been asked, off and on, to give money for private expeditions and intelligencegathering activities.  Some 2,500 Americans are still missing from the war. American officials believe that most, if not all, are dead. United States combat involvement in the region ended in 1973.  Possibility Not Ruled Out  But the possibility that some of the men might still be alive and in prison, as refugees from Southeast Asia periodically report, has never been totally ruled out. In fact, several years ago, when negotiations with the Laotians and Vietnamese were getting nowhere, the United States Government reportedly sponsored its own search expedition. It returned empty-handed.  Since then, the negotiations have been more productive, according to American officials. The Laotians and Vietnamese have denied that any prisoners are still being held, but delegations from the United States have been received by both countries and the remains of a number of men have been returned.  The United States has no diplomatic relations with either Laos or Vietnam.  ''We have been making some progress and so these private raids are counterproductive,'' a White House official said after learning of the recent incursion into Laos. ''We've been encouraged up to now by what we've been hearing from the Laotians and, to a lesser extent, from the Vietnamese. We don't want to lose this headway. It's a delicate situation.''  One of the main goals of the negotiations with the Laotians is to win permission for American recovery experts to accompany Laotian officials on visits to several hundred sites where United States planes are known to have crashed during the war. About a fourth of the Americans still unaccounted for in Southeast Asia were lost in Laos.  Last week, during a convention of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, President Reagan said the United States Government had placed the ''highest national priority'' on obtaining a full accounting. His remarks were enthusiastically received by league members, some of whom had questioned the commitment of previous Presidents and had contributed money to private search efforts.  The league also heard from William P. Clark, the President's assistant for national security affairs, who said the Reagan Administration was ''resolutely opposed'' to private across-theborder forays. ''Such actions,'' he said, ''interfere with and damage legitimate efforts on a number of fronts. Our experience has been that such private initiatives operate with faulty or fabricated intelligence and lack even marginally adquate operational capabilities.''  The latest expedition into Laos took place in late November and involved several Americans and about a dozen sympathetic Laotian guerrillas. The group, reportedly led by James G. Gritz of Los Angeles, a former lieutenant colonel in the Special Forces and a Vietnam War veteran, went in search of 120 Americans who refugees had said were being held in prison.  Shortly after crossing into Laos from Thailand, the group was fired upon. It suffered casualties and withdrew.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 1983, Tuesday, Late City Final Edition  CORRECTION: Because of an editing error, an article yesterday on private searches for missing servicemen in Indochina incorrectly described relations between the United States and Laos. They maintain diplomatic relations.                      ",February 6 1983 ,2
"      The United States and the Communist Government of Laos, after years of tense relations, have quietly begun discussions aimed at upgrading their diplomatic missions and gaining closer ties, Administration officials said today.  In recent months, they said, Laos has sent several significant signals to the Reagan Administration that State Department and White House officials view as opening the way to firmer links between Vientiane and Washington. These include welcoming and assisting an American group searching for information on United States servicemen missing in action since the Indochina war, as well as affording American diplomats access to Laotian Government officials for the first time in years.  ''They want to move forward,'' an Administration official said.  Another official remarked, ''They appear more flexible, more sensitive.''  S.I. Hayakawa, the former Republican Senator from California who was chairman of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before he left Congress last year, is scheduled to visit Laos this month in the course of an Asian trip to ''further signal our interest,'' one Administration official said.  Under Hanoi's Dominance  Laos, an impoverished, landlocked nation on the Indochinese peninsula, has remained under the dominance of neighboring Vietnam since the collapse of the South Vietnamese Government in Saigon in April 1975. At that point, the Laotian monarchy was abolished, the coalition Government that sought neutrality collapsed and the Communist Lao People's Democratic Party was established. There are currently about 50,000 Vietnamese soldiers and 36,000 Laotian troops in the country.  United States officials say talks with Laos remain sensitive, largely because of Vietnam's dominance, if not control, over the Laotian Government. The United States has no diplomatic relations with Hanoi, mainly because of Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.  ''We view Vietnam and Laos as different entities despite Vietnam's occupation of Laos and the top leadership being advised very strongly by Vietnam,'' said one official. He noted that the Laotians are culturally, ethnically and linguistically far closer to Thailand and other Asian nations than to Vietnam.  Although the move by Laos to seek better relations with the United States ''has a dynamic of its own,'' the decision probably has the ''blessing'' of the Hanoi Government, said one Administration official involved in the talks. Vietnam's diplomatic isolation because of its occupation of Cambodia, and its heavy reliance on the Soviet Union, are viewed by United States officials as key reasons for Hanoi's efforts to ''reverse the current trend'' and open up Laotian relations with the United States.  Missions May Be Upgraded  According to several officials, the measures under discussion include an upgrading to ambassador status of the diplomatic missions in Washington and Vientiane. Currently, the highest-ranking diplomats in both missions, which are kept to a handful of personnel, are those with charge d'affaires status.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",May 16 1983 ,2
"   , Thailand, June 28   A senior Reagan Administration official said today that the United States had information that kept it from ruling out the possibility that some Americans captured during the Vietnam War are still alive.  The official said the Administration ''has information in its possesion that precludes ruling out the possibility that live Americans are being held captive in Indochina.''  The official said more than 200 reports from refugees who claimed to have seen American prisoners in Indochina in recent years could not be dismissed. He said polygraph tests supported many of the refugees' reports.  Because of these reports, the official said, the Reagan Administration decided to increase diplomatic efforts to account for missing Americans and to expand intelligence-collection to try to check the refugees' reports. He said the Administration had asked Congress to increase by 25 percent the number of analysts working on the problem in the Defense Intelligence Agency. He said there were 14 or 15 analysts now.  Shultz Addresses Issue  The issue came up today when Secretary of State George P. Shultz appeared to endorse private efforts to recover dead American servicemen in Indochina, a position contradictory to that of the Administration.  Mr. Shultz, speaking at a news conference at the end of a meeting of Southeast Asian nations, said the American Government was for ''any means that can be effective'' in locating and recovering the 2,494 Americans listed as missing in action. He also refused to rule out Government support for a recovery mission headed by James G. (Bo) Gritz, a former Army Special Forces officer in Vietnam who led a mission into Laos last year that failed.  Mr. Shultz's comments contradicted assertions by the Reagan Administration that it considered such private efforts illegal and damaging to official efforts with the same goal.  Immediately after the news conference, State Department officials traveling with Mr. Shultz said that he had not meant to endorse such private efforts and that the Reagan Administration remained opposed to them. They said Mr. Shultz might have been confused because he was not fully briefed about the issue, was not familiar with Mr. Gritz's history and had apparently misunderstood a question.  When asked whether the United States would support a mission by Mr. Gritz, Mr. Shultz said, ''The answer is very unlikely, but these things would have to looked upon case by case.''  U.S. Sought Asians' Help  Mr. Shultz's remarks grew out of the Administration's effort to make the recovery of American dead in Indochina a major issue at the meeting here of the Foreign Ministers of the five countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and the Philippines - and their six so-called dialogue partners, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, West Germany and the United States.  In a speech to the five Foreign Ministers today Mr. Shultz asked their help in accounting for the missing. He described the issue as a ''matter of the highest priority for President Reagan and for the American people.''  The official said that in a closed meeting with the Foreign Ministers, Mr. Shultz reported that the United States had information indicating that 400 dead Americans were being ''deliberately withheld'' by Vietnam. Mr. Shultz, an official said, called the Vietnamese action ''cruel and heartless.''  Later, after the news conference, the official who spoke about the possibility that Americans are still being held captive said that the information about the 400 American war dead came from a Vietnamese undertaker who defected to the United States several years ago. The official said the undertaker's account was also supported by the results of a polygraph test, the so-called lie-detector test.  The Mission Into Laos  The issue of missing serviceman returned to prominence this year when Mr. Gritz turned himself in to the Thai authorities, who had sought him for illegally crossing the border between Thailand and Laos.  Mr. Gritz, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, led a small band of Americans and Indochinese into Laos last year to try to find the missing dead and check reports about American prisoners.  Several prominent Americans, including William Shatner, the star of the television series ''Star Trek,'' later said they had helped pay for the Gritz mission. It failed when the men were discovered and attacked by Laotian military forces. Mr. Gritz and his colleagues fled back to Thailand.  After the mission was disclosed, the Reagan Administration denied claims by Mr. Gritz that he had received support from the Defense Department. The Administration also condemned the effort, saying it opposed illegal, cross-border forays.  At the news conference, Mr. Shultz said that working ''through official channels is probably in the long run the most effective method.'' But he added, ''Clearly, we are anxious to have any method used that would help return the remains of the deceased and provide information for us and for the families on those who are missing.''  Asked what sort of methods he would support, Mr. Shultz said, ''The key word is if it has a good chance of being effective.'' He also said, ''Of course, any means that can be effective we're for.''  Mr. Shultz is scheduled to fly from to New Delhi on Wednesday for two days of talks with Indian leaders. His Asian trip will end with a stop in Pakistan.  ----  8 War Dead Identified  WASHINGTON, June 28 (AP) - The Pentagon today identified eight Air Force and Navy dead from the Vietnam war who were turned over to an American delegation in Hanoi this month.  The Air Force members were Col. Larry W. Biediger of La Coste, Tex.; Col. John F. Dudash of Manville, N.J.; Col. Farrell Sullivan Jr. of Caddo Mills, Tex., and Lieut. Col. Merwin L. Morrill of San Carlos, Calif.  The Navy members were Cmdr. Donald F. Lindland of Eugene, Ore.; Lieut. Cmdr. Charles R. Lee of Costa Mesa, Calif.; Lieut. Cmdr. James T. Ruffin of Deatsville, Ala., and Capt. Lynn K. Powell of Provo, Utah.  The Pentagon said they were lost in 1966, 1967, and 1972.

"      It remains one of the final reminders that the Vietnam War is not completely over.  Once a month, in a State Department conference room, half a dozen Government officials and one outsider meet behind a closed door to discuss whatever new information and rumor has emerged about the fate of the 2,491 Americans missing in Indochina. The solemn bureacratic chatter is tinged with elements of anger, pain and heartbreak.  ''There is still, simply, a great deal of emotional drain for families,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. ''A lot of kids want to know what happened to their fathers. The drain continues, after all these years.''  Miss Griffiths, whose brother, Lieut. Comdr. Jim Mills, was shot down off the coast of Vietnam on Sept. 21, 1966, is the only non-Government participant at the monthly meetings, which are attended by representatives of the Pentagon, White House, Defense Intelligence Agency, Joint Chiefs of Staff and other agencies.  Although the meetings are listed as confidential, Miss Griffiths is allowed to attend because of the ''strong interest'' of the families involved. The chairman of the meetings is John Monjo, an Assistant Secretary of State.  Vietnamese 'Not Cooperative'  In the meantime, American and Vietnamese officials meet four times a year in Hanoi to exchange specific information about missing Americans, mostly Air Force and Navy pilots and crew members who were shot down over Vietnam and Laos.  ''The Vietnamese have not been cooperative to any appreciable extent,'' said one State Department official. ''They seem to dribble out remains as it suits their purpose. There's pretty good reason to believe they may have 400 remains, stacked up, ready to turn over at will, somewhere in Hanoi.''  Although the Vietnamese have denied this, the State Department official said that the information was based on ''credible information.''  Why would the Vietnamese hold such remains?  ''Everything they do, as far as we're concerned, is bound to reflect a political advantage they want to gain,'' said the official. ''We assume they would want to trade the remains for something in return.''  On the murky issue of whether surviving Americans are being held against their will, the State Department speaks in qualified tones.  Unconfirmed Sightings  ''It's conceivable,'' said one official. ''Our position is we have received a variety of reports of live sightings. We take action to investigate these. We have not been able to confirm that there are any Americans being held against their will in Indochina.''  In recent years there have been unconfirmed refugee reports of sightings of missing Americans in the jungles of Southeast Asia, as well as repeated accusations that the Hanoi Government was withholding remains. Hanoi has said that the dense jungles in which many Americans were lost during the war made it impossible for them to find further remains. Since the end of the war the Vietnamese have returned 87 bodies.  Officials believe there may be a certain number of American deserters and others, some married to local women, who have remained behind in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, at their own choice.  Miss Griffiths said that the revived interest in the fate of Americans in Indochina was the direct result of President Reagan's personal involvement in the issue.  ''It was different under Nixon, Ford and Carter,'' she said. ''That's changed now. This President cares.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 27 1983 ,2

The Vietnamese Government no longer links the missing Americans with other issues between the two countries, said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Missing In Action-Prisoners of War Families.

"      The Vietnamese Government, lacking formal diplomatic ties with the United States, has asked an organization of American veterans of the Vietnam War to visit Hanoi every three months for talks on a variety of issues.  The Reagan Administration says it opposes the plan, but a State Department official indicated it would probably not try to prevent the veterans group from talking to the Vietnamese. The group, the Vietnam Veterans of America, says it will not seek to negotiate on behalf of the United States Government.  The meetings are expected to touch on such subjects as American servicemen still missing in Southeast Asia, the resettlement of children of American servicemen and Vietnamese women from Vietnam to the United States and cultural exchanges. The date of the first meeting has not yet been set.  The arrangement was disclosed as Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, postponed a scheduled meeting with American officials to discuss the question of some 2,490 American servicemen still listed as missing. Mr. Thach said Thursday that the meeting was being delayed ''for technical reasons'' until the middle of May, adding that United States hostility to Vietam was hampering the relationship.  ''A good atmosphere is needed,'' said Mr. Thach.  Invited as Intermediaries  Robert O. Muller, a former United States Marine lieutenant who was wounded in Vietnam in 1969 and is now president of the Vietnam Veterans of America, said in an interview that Mr. Thach and other Vietnamese officials had invited the veterans group to send delegations to Hanoi at least every three months to serve as intermediaries between the two Governments.  The invitation was extended when Mr. Thach met Mr. Muller and six other veterans in Hanoi two weeks ago, Mr. Muller said.  ''They expressed to us many times the desire to work directly with the U.S. Government on issues such as Amerasians and Agent Orange information,'' Mr. Muller said. ''But our Government will not talk to them. So we do represent the only channel with which to exchange information.''  One State Department official, referring to the Vietnamese-backed regime in Cambodia, said the United States ''will not consider normalization of relations with Vietnam as long as it occupies Kampuchea.''  Some Informal Contacts  Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, maintaining that it did so in order to save the country from the atrocities of Mr. Pol Pot's regime. Since then the United States has had some informal contacts with Vietnam, including visits by United States officials and Congressmen as well as veterans to Hanoi.  ''We see our role as providing a bridge to Vietnam, a conduit to dialogue,'' Mr. Muller added. ''The U.S. has expressed to us the desire that we do not conduct these discussions with Vietnam.''  Lyall Breckon, director of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodian affairs at the State Department, who met with some of the veterans on Friday, said, ''As a general principle, in the resolution of the P.O.W. and M.I.A. issue, we believe that Government to Government contacts are the correct way to approach and resolve the issue.''  Another State Department official said the Administration opposed the intercession of the veterans group.  ''We try to consult very closely with Vietnam organizations and the families but we think these issues are best handled through Government channels,'' he said, adding that, as far as he knew, the State Department ''will not stand in the way of the veterans.''  List Issues for Talks  Mr. Muller said the veterans would seek to help deal with such issues as missing servicemen, the acceleration of the resettlement of children of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers, the visit of American scientists studying the effects of the herbicide Agent Orange, which was sprayed by United States forces to defoliate jungle battlefields, as well as cultural exchanges and visits.  In the last two years the United States has sought infrequent official visits to Hanoi, mostly by Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage, who has traveled to Hanoi to inquire about Americans missing in action. Mr. Armitage last visited Vietnam in February.  Since the end of the war in 1975, the remains of 88 soldiers have been returned, and the Reagan Administration has not ruled out the possibility that some Americans captured during the war are still alive. The Hanoi Government denies such a possibility.  Mr. Muller said he saw the role of the veterans as ''serving as a backstop, monitoring progress'' as well as lobbying Congress on several issues including the plight of Amerasian children. Mr. Muller pointed out that there are an estimated 25,000 to 40,000 of the children in Vietnam. They are treated as outcasts, but only 1,000 have been resettled so far in the United States.  A key reason for the small number of the children in the United States, Mr. Muller said, was the fact that quota restrictions in the United States had limited their emigration from Vietnam. Mr. Muller said that Vietnamese officials had told him that American officials had suggested that more children would be allowed into the United States if the Vietnamese released a number of prisoners in ''re-education camps'' who had worked for the United States Embassy during the war.  A State Department official said: ''There's absolutely no connection. The Amerasian children are one issue. Another issue is we'd like to see movement on the Vietnamese held in re- education camps to whom we feel a special responsibility. The Vietnamese have so far refused to release people from these camps.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 22 1984 ,2
"    PENH, Cambodia, July 1   A senior Vietnamese official says continuing United States unfriendliness toward Vietnam after a war that ravaged the civilian population has hurt Hanoi's efforts to get villagers to cooperate in searching for missing Americans.  ''Members of my family were killed,'' the official said in an interview here last week with visiting foreign journalists. ''Even my friends, even those who are alive, I don't know where they are. Now the Americans are not friendly to us. How can we get the people's support?''  He said that the United States, without reciprocating, is ''imposing'' efforts on Vietnam and Cambodia to resolve cases of Americans listed as missing in action.  BANGKOK, Thailand, July 1 (AP) - A United States Embassy spokesman, responding to the Vietnamese official's remarks, said, ''The Vietnamese authorities have agreed with us at a very senior level that resolution of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue is a humanitarian matter to be dealt with separate from other issues.''

"      Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Hanoi Government had agreed to meet again next month on the issue of the nearly 2,500 Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.  He made the disclosure in a speech to the Honolulu Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Shultz arrived on Tuesday at the end of a 10-day trip to Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.  On Tuesday, Vietnam handed over the remains of what it believed to be eight Americans, and they arrived today at Hickam Air Force Base here from Manila. A special armed forces center here will try to confirm the tentative identifications.  The technical talks with Vietnam on the possible whereabouts of the 2,490 still listed as missing, most of them now believed dead, began in mid-1982 and were to be held every three months.  Talks Were Suspended in '83  But after a session in June 1983, the Vietnamese canceled further meetings after being criticized by the United States Government and by the National League of P.O.W.-M.I.A. Families, which will hold its annual meeting in Washington this weekend to discuss the issue of possible remaining prisoners of war and missing in action.  Aides to Mr. Shultz said about half the missing were believed to have been killed in action. In those cases, where planes were seen crashing, a military aide said, there is no expectation of anything more than receiving the remains if the Vietnamese were to cooperate by sending search teams to areas where the United States knows the planes crashed.  The aide said there were 400 to 500 Americans on which ''a reasonable effort by the Vietnamese ought to come up with positive results.''  An area of particular concern involves 50 to 60 Americans who were photographed alive in Vietnam after being captured or were seen alive soon after falling into Vietnamese hands. The Vietnamese have provided no information on them.  150 'Live Sightings' Reported  In addition, aides said, there have been 150 ''live sightings.'' These sightings, often reported by Vietnamese refugees, are unverified accounts of Vietnamese seeing unidentified whites in remote areas. These purported sightings have generated periodic rumors that some Americans might still be alive in Vietnam.  Aides to Mr. Shultz said that, while it could not be definitively ruled out that some Americans might be alive, there was no supporting evidence to indicate that there were any.  By 1979, the Vietnamese said every living American had been returned. But then came the repatriation of Pfc. Robert R. Garwood of the Marines, who had stayed behind, and his case cast doubt on Vietnam's assurances.  An aide said 17 full-time analysts in the Defense Intelligence Agency keep track of the missing-in-action category and of reports of possible sightings.  Two Criteria for Hanoi Ties  The United States has said that it will not establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam until two criteria are met: All the missing in action must be accounted for, and Vietnam must agree to an acceptable formula for removing its 160,000 troops from Cambodia.  In the Honolulu speech, Mr. Shultz reflected the Reagan Administration's view that Asia was the area offering the most opportunity in the future for American policy makers.  Noting American economic interests and diplomatic efforts in the region, he put particular stress on the need for a strong United States military presence. He said there was ''an enormous concentration of military power'' by nations unfriendly to the United States and its allies. He mentioned Vietnam, North Korea and the Soviet Union.  As to the question of military cooperation with China, an issue he found to be sensitive to Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia that are concerned about possible Chinese expansionism, Mr. Shultz said:  ''Careful discussions have begun on ways in which American technology and equipment might better enable China to counter Soviet military intimidation. This is an important development, but it is also an area where we give careful consideration to the concerns of our allies and other friends in the region.''

"      President Reagan said today that Laos had agreed to allow United States officials to excavate a site to search for the remains of 13 American servicemen whose plane crashed there nearly 12 years ago.  Mr. Reagan made the disclosure during a ceremony at the White House in honor of National P.O.W./M.I.A. Recognition Day. At the ceremony, the President said the Administration was determined to recover the remains and press for information on 2,489 Americans unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, as well as 8,177 from the Korean War.  About 600 of the 2,489 were reported dead or missing in Laos. The Vientiane Government met with American officials last year and allowed a technical team to visit the crash site, near the city of Pakse.    Maintained Diplomatic Ties  The United States, which severed diplomatic relations with Vietnam and Cambodia after the Communist takeovers there in 1975, has maintained diplomatic relations with Laos, but has said ties could not be improved until the missing-in-action issue was resolved.  Today, Mr. Reagan said Laos ''seems to have gained a greater understanding of the importance to us of the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue.''  ''We, in return, have gained a greater understanding of their feelings and problems,'' he said. ''This process has led us to discussions of joint crash site searches.''    'Working Out the Details'  ''And in this regard, I want to pass on some good news to you,'' he said. ''Late last night, we were informed by the Government of Laos of official agreement in principle to excavation of a U.S. crash site. We're working out the details now. We welcome this cooperative gesture.''  A Defense Department spokesman said Mr. Reagan was referring to an Air Force gunship that exploded in midair on Dec. 21, 1972, near Pakse, with 16 men aboard. Two parachuted to safety, and one body was found the next day.  At the ceremony today, with many former prisoners of war and families of missing in action in the audience, Mr. Reagan said the prisoners of war ''have been, and are, the bravest of the brave.''  ''They kept a trusting heart, they retained their spirit and their will, and they kept the faith,'' he said. ''They trusted us, and that trust did us great honor.''  He pledged that the Administration would make a major effort on behalf of the missing in action, or those who are assumed to be killed, but whose remains have not been recovered. Mr. Reagan, implicitly seeming to criticize past Administrations, said the families of the missing had for many years ''stood alone in your quest for answers.''  ''Well, today, you're not alone,'' he said. ''And I tell you from my heart, you will never be alone again.''  'Sightings' by Refugees  Of the 2,489 Americans listed as unaccounted for, about 1,150 have been reported killed in action, but their remains have not been recovered. Of the others, American officials have said there is no verified evidence that any are alive, although there have been ''sightings.'' Most such sightings have been by Vietnamese refugees, who say they have seen people they assumed to be Americans.  On Wednesday Secretary of State George P. Shultz said that Vietnam had agreed to resume talks in mid-August on locating the remains and providing information on those unaccounted for in Vietnam.  Mr. Reagan, noting that today was the 30th anniversary of the signing of agreements in Geneva on Indochina, said the hoped-for peace had never come to that part of the world. He said Vietnam and the United States ''still have major differences.''  But he said he was ''encouraged'' by Vietnam's willingness to cooperate on the missing-in-action question.  8,177 Missing in Korea  Mr. Reagan said resolution of that issue, as well as Vietnam's agreement to negotiations on Cambodia with other countries in the area, ''provide the key for ending Vietnam's isolation.''  ''Normal relations with the international community can bring an end to the long suffering of the people of Vietnam,'' he said. ''And I believe it to be in Vietnam's own interest to choose this path. It's a decision that we would welcome.''  Mr. Reagan also addressed the less publicized situation in Korea, where 8,177 Americans are officially listed as unaccounted for. He said the United States had pressed North Korea for an accounting of any missing from that war. He also said some Korean War veterans recently provided information on possible grave locations.  A White House official said the information was on possible sites in South Korea, and talks were going on with the South Korean Government. But neither State Department nor Pentagon officials were able to shed light on why it had taken so long to find sites in South Korea, a United States ally.

"   , Thailand, Jan. 31   Vietnam's Foreign Minister said today that Hanoi would welcome a more active American role in solving the problems of Southeast Asia.  Speaking at a news conference in Hanoi marking the end of a three-day visit to Vietnam by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said of the Americans:  ''If they can can make a war here, they can easily make a peace.''  For his part, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said he was ''very agreeably surprised'' at the positive responses he got from the Vietnamese on ''three or four'' issues the United States had asked him to raise in Hanoi.  One of these issues involves the nearly 2,500 Americans still missing from the Vietnam War. Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials say they plan to meet with Americans next month to further explore the technicalities of searching for remains.  Speaking to reporters on his flight back to Bangkok this afternoon, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said he was buoyed by his reception in Hanoi. ''Mr. Thach said the time is right for finding a solution to the problem of Cambodia - and that's enough for me.''   LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 30 1985 ,2
"   , Indonesia, March 19   Vietnam is proposing to normalize relations with the United States as a way of eventually settling the Cambodia conflict, Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, said today.  Mr. Mochtar described the initiative as one of the ''new elements'' in a five- point proposal he brought back with him Sunday from a trip to Hanoi.  The normalization process would begin, he said, with a Vietnamese response to repeated United States requests for information on American soldiers listed as missing in action in the Vietnam War.  A second ''new element'' in Vietnam's five-point proposal is apparently Hanoi's willingness to drop the issue of foreign military bases in the region from future peace talks on Cambodia.

"      The United States and Vietnam will hold talks on the highest level in nine years next Monday in Hanoi, the State Department announced today.  The purpose of the meeting is to lay the groundwork for resolving the problem of the nearly 1,800 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam.  Charles E. Redman, a department spokesman, said the United States hoped to build on ''the significant increase'' in cooperation that has become apparent.  The American team will be headed by Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, and by Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Others in the group are Richard Childress, political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff at the White House, and Anne Mills Griffiths, executive director of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. To Meet With Foreign Minister They will confer with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and with a Deputy Foreign Minister, Hoang Bich Son, Mr. Redman said.  This is the latest in a series of recent moves toward tackling the emotionally charged issue of the Americans still not unaccounted for from the war. It is the highest-level American delegation to visit Vietnam since Leonard Woodcock, then the president of the United Auto Workers, visited Hanoi in 1977 on behalf of President Jimmy Carter, to discuss normalization of relations.  The United States lists 1,797 Americans as unaccounted for in Vietnam, 700 in the north and 1,097 in the south. In addition, 556 are listed as unaccounted for in Laos, 82 in Cambodia, and 6 in China, for a total of 2,441.  Of this total, half are listed on a roll of killed in action, but bodies not recovered. The other half is on the list of prisoners of war and missing in action, but the Pentagon regards all but one of them as legally dead.  The one American still regarded legally as missing or captured, is Col. Charles Shelton, an Air Force pilot, who is known to have been captured in Laos by Pathet Lao forces on April 29, 1965, a Pentagon spokesman said today. He is listed as missing or captured ''symbolically,'' the spokesman said, to demonstrate American interest in the issue.  Since the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, the United States has received over 800 reports of first-hand sightings of people who are possibly Americans in Indochina. The Pentagon, in a news release last month, said most of these cases had been resolved as either fabrications or involving Americans who had returned to the United States.  But 119 cases are still under investigation,'' it said.  Of these 119, there are 28 from North Vietnam, 74 from South Vietnam, 15 from Laos and 2 from Cambodia.  Until the issue is resolved, the United States Government takes the position that ''although we have been thus far been unable to prove that Americans are still detained against their will, the information available to us precludes ruling out that possibility.''  The United States has made this a priority issue before there can be discussion about the establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam. The United States has also said that Vietnam would have to agree to a formula for withdrawing its 160,000 troops from Cambodia and allowing open elections there.  High-Level Talks Proposed  Vietnam said in July that it wanted the issue of the missing American resolved once and for all within two years.  It proposed high-level talks to discuss ways of dealing with the problem. The United States agreed and originally scheduled the Armitage-Wolfowitz mission for Aug. 23. But when Foreign Minister Thach said he had to go to Moscow on that date, only Mr. Childress and Mrs. Griffiths went to Hanoi.  After that visit, the State Department said Sept. 3 that the discussions had been ''the most positive'' to date.  There have since been follow-up talks between Mr. Childress and Vietnamese officials at the United Nations. And last month, a joint United States-Vietnam team searched for remains of Americans in a rural area six miles north of Hanoi where a B-52 bomber crashed in December 1972. That effort ended Dec. 1, with only slim hopes of identifying American servicemen from the unearthed bone fragments. Information About Crash Sites State Department officials said the United States had information about the sites of plane crashes and locations where Americans were seen being taken prisoner, and that increased efforts could make headway in clearing up many cases.  The Vietnamese have been handing over remains over the years. So far, 130 remains identified as Americans have been turned over since 1974, 17 from Laos, and 2 from Cambodia. There is a persistent belief, based on what is said to be plausible information from a Vietnamese refugee, that the remains of several hundred Americans are stored in a Hanoi warehouse mortuary. This has been denied by Vietnam.  In a related matter, the State Department announced that Laos had authorized a team of American technical specialists to examine a site where an Air Force AC-130 gunship crashed during the Vietnam war. A similar team was able to recover the remains of 13 Americans in an excavation last February.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",December 30 1985 ,2
"   , Md.   Donald Shay's father is retired now. Donald's little sister has two young children of her own. His fiancee finally married someone else. And Donald's mother doesn't bake his favorite apple pie much anymore; the good smell brings back too many bad memories.  Mr. Shay doesn't know any of this. And he may never know. In fact, his family may never know where he is, or where he was when he died, if he died. For Mr. Shay is one of 2,477 Americans still missing in action from the Vietnam War.  Ten years after the fall of Saigon and 15 years after that smiling, 24-year-old lacrosse player flew off a radar screen into his family's memory somewhere over Indochina, no one knows for sure what happened to any of the missing Americans.    More Than Mere Statistics  But in one of the more mysterious legacies of that painful era in American history, these men who went off to war as individuals have now become, as a group, much more than simply a sad statistic. They are the subject of movies, books and songs, the object of angry demonstrations, earnest petitions and solemn vigils, the focus of intense Presidential interest, microscopic analysis and secret satellite photography and the heart of some delicate diplomatic exchanges trying to bridge broad cultural chasms.  The alleged remains of some missing men, reduced to bones and fragments after years in the jungle, have even become the currency of a ghoulish, clandestine commerce that preys on the hopes and fears of families and refugees.  ''Somehow,'' said one United States Government official, ''the mystery of their disappearance and their deaths have taken on a peculiar life of their own.''  For military records, all but one of the missing are officially presumed dead, ending the pay, automatic promotion and service benefits accruing for years. Only the case of a single missing flier remains active for symbolic reasons. But for diplomatic records, the missing remain a live issue, a major obstacle to the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United States and a lever for some Southeast Asian lands to keep the United States in the region as a political counterbalance.  For some family members, the missing relative is dead, a sad part of a slowly fading past that might somehow still miraculously reappear and complicate a brand new life. Other relatives still wait, in hope that their loved one might walk back through the door some day, perhaps tomorrow.  For the children of the missing, many of them not so childish anymore, the absent father is often but a dim memory, kept alive on den walls or treasured tape cassettes by sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers or wives, some of them remarried, some of them happy now, some of them troubled, all of them scarred.  ''It's been such a long time to be uncertain,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, whose brother vanished in Vietnam nearly two decades ago. ''You want to be realistic. But you're afraid to give up hope.''  By the standards of war, America's 2,477 Vietnam missing are few, thanks to modern recovery methods, the nature of land fighting and new forensic technology that enables investigators to identify even partial remains by, for instance, electronically reconstructing a skull from a fragment.    Tallies of the Missing  The Center for Military History still lists 3,350 missing in action from World War I, 8,177 in Korea, where M.I.A. teams still mount occasional search excavations, and 78,777 from World War II, when many were lost at sea.  Of the Vietnam missing, 706 were in the Army, 937 in the Air Force, 500 in the Navy, 291 in the Marine Corps and 1 in the Coast Guard. The other 42 were civilians. Of the missing, 1,101 disappeared in or over South Vietnam, 719 in North Vietnam, 569 in Laos, 82 in Cambodia and 6 over China.  Privately, American officials and relatives admit there is little hope of accounting for many of the missing, perhaps even a majority, and most likely for all those who disappeared in Cambodia, the scene of almost continuous fighting since.  In addition, 1,186 of the total missing are really listed as Killed in Action- Body Not Recovered. These are, for instance, pilots whose planes were seen to crash with no parachutes or soldiers who were killed on patrol under circumstances in which comrades could not retrieve the body.  An unknown number will never be found because there are no remains to find. Last year when members of Congress pressured Lieut. Gen. James A. Williams, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to tell them how many realistically might be found, he testified: ''Some of these people have disappeared by being completely obliterated. If you have ever watched an explosion disintegrate somebody, you would understand that that happens.''  A Lower Priority  A full accounting of both prisoners of war and missing was part of the 1973 Paris accords that arranged United States disengagement from the Vietnam conflict, where 58,022 Americans died. North Vietnam returned 591 prisoners in 1973, and another 134 returned or escaped at other times. But with the American withdrawal and the fall of Saigon 10 years ago this month, the missing got a lower priority by a Government and public eager to put the divisive war behind. Few remains were returned; 102 since 1973, including two non-Americans.  Two commissions reported to President Carter that there were no live American prisoners remaining in Indochina. And each military service moved administratively to declare all the missing dead.  What happened in 1980 was the election as President of Ronald Reagan, who as Governor of California spoke out often and emotionally for the need of a full accounting. He was photographed wearing one of the M.I.A. bracelets engraved with the name of a missing man and sold in the war to show symbolic support. The President still keeps five M.I.A. bracelets hanging in his study next to the Oval Office.  ''The way our system of government works,'' said one aide, ''if the President is personally interested in something, then the Government is interested in it. And Mr. and Mrs. Reagan are personally very interested in M.I.A.'s.''  New Place on Agenda  In the past four years this interest, displayed through numerous speeches and public references, through many private telephone calls and letters to M.I.A. families and through countless Reagan Administration meetings and a still-secret 10-point National Security Council strategy, has raised the subject to what the President calls ''the highest national priority.''  It has also left few Government officials willing to question the campaign or to be quoted by name. ''Few people in the Vatican,'' said one, ''would tell the Pope they question the faith.''  The broad public and private strategy has involved efforts to mobilize the Government's bureaucracy, the intelligence community and bipartisan political support to transmit a convincing signal to Hanoi that an accounting is necessary before any aid or normalizing of relations.  The President got an unusual security clearance for Mrs. Griffiths, the executive director of the National League of M.I.A.-P.O.W. Families. She now routinely attends relevant meetings of the National Security Council as well as diplomatic negotiations in New York and Hanoi.  One result has been to dissipate the harsh criticism the league has aimed at previous ''do-nothing'' Administrations. ''For a while,'' said Mrs. Griffiths, a Californian whose organization says it has 3,000 M.I.A. family members and 15,000 concerned people as supporters, ''our families felt they were fighting their own Government as well as the Vietnamese.''  But another result, tied in with a growing public willingness to address the emotional legacies of the war, has been the eager involvement of a variety of groups and individuals who profess patriotism but have at times complicated diplomatic efforts. ''It's a very thin line,'' said one Administration strategist.  Veterans Groups' Actions  Veterans groups have helped gather millions of petition signatures demanding accountings of the missing from the Vietnamese, and they recently provided the Hanoi Government with details on some unmarked burial sites of its missing. One small group has staged a round-the-clock vigil at the Vietnam Memorial since Dec. 24, 1982.  Others, however, have burned Vietnamese flags before that country's mission to the United Nations, while some groups raise money from Americans to mount ''rescue raids,'' which produced no verifiable results and complicated official talks.  What seems to capture the public imagination on the missing is the lingering uncertainty about their fate and, in the view of some, a wishful willingness to believe any scrap of information and to distrust any Vietnamese denials about remaining prisoners of war.  ''We have returned everyone,'' Le Kim Chung, Vietnam's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, said in an interview. ''Also, why would we want to keep them? We have enough troubles without keeping Americans.''  Mr. Le also denounced as fabrications refugee reports of caches of American remains. One Vietnamese undertaker who fled to the United States told Congress he saw 400 such remains in a Hanoi warehouse, which many in Washington believe.  Sightings of Whites  What has proven most tantalizing to M.I.A. families and the 18 Defense Intelligence Agency analysts assigned full time to sifting data about the missing are reports of ''live sightings,'' usually from refugees, of a white in Indochina in a particular place on a particular date. According to Col. Gerald S. Venanzi, a former prisoner of war who is the Pentagon's senior authority on the missing, there have been more than 750 reported sightings since 1973, some of prisoners and some of men free of visible restraints.  All refugee camps have multilingual posters seeking information about the missing. Those responding are interviewed by special teams, sometimes using polygraphs, or lie detectors. ''We have him describe his village, his house, where he saw the Caucasian,'' said one intelligence official who sought anonymity. ''With computers we can cross-check his identity with other refugees from the same village. And with satellites we can photograph the place right down to the fence in his yard.''  Analysts believe some stories are fabrications planted by Vietnamese to discredit refugee reports and consume valuable tracking resources. Other reports turn out to be Europeans or stem from refugees seeking favorable immigration treatment. There is no pattern to the sightings, but 175 such reports remain unresolved, prompting officials to say they cannot rule out the possibility some prisoners remain.  Should live Americans be found, officials said, the President has authorized any means necessary to extricate them. ''This could range from diplomacy to black helicopters in the night,'' said one official.  'Maybe He's Better Dead'  Edna Hicks clings to such reports as proof that her son Terrin, a 31-year-old pilot when his plane was downed over North Vietnam in 1968, could be alive. ''It'd be a miracle, a long shot, I know,'' said Mrs. Hicks, now 70 years old, who sometimes still speaks of her son in the present tense. ''Some days you feel he's alive. Some days not. And then you think, what would he be like after 17 years of imprisonment and torture? Maybe he's better dead.''  To some, the inability of such vast intelligence capabilities to confirm the existence of a live American prisoner is proof that none exist and suggests the Administration is using rhetoric to fuel false hopes.  The Administration's known interest is also fueling a brisk border business in bones, as refugees, resistance forces and others appear, usually in Thailand, with plastic bags purportedly containing American remains, some of which are really animal bones. Various forms of military identification have also been offered, some belonging to American soldiers long since safely home.  That is how Nicholas Brooks of Newburgh, N.Y., finally came home 12 years after parachuting from his stricken plane over Laos. His remains were delivered to Bangkok by a Lao resistance member and identified at a special military laboratory in a concrete-block warehouse in Honolulu. Technicians there can determine age, sex, race, blood type and basic stature even from partial remains. Physical characteristics such as height, weight, broken bones and dental records for all the missing have been computerized.  Using other Asian governments and the United Nations for pressure, the Reagan Administration continues negotiations for the return of M.I.A.'s from Laos, where a joint excavation team recovered remains from an American crash site in February, and from Vietnam, which turned over the remains of six others in March.  Outlook Seems to Improve  Detailed files for each man, concentrating on cases believed most physically accessible, are turned over to Vietnamese at meetings in a sparsely furnished Foreign Ministry room in Hanoi. The Vietnamese, citing humanitarian reasons and saying families of the missing are victims of the war like themselves, recently agreed to increase these sessions to a minimum of six a year. Both sides say they detect increasing cooperation. One United Nations official called it ''a definite defrosting'' of the M.I.A. issue with a ''mounting momentum'' that also affords Vietnam a window from its diplomatic isolation.  In regular visits to Hanoi and quiet dinners in New York, American officials seek to quicken the pace of returns, calling it ''good-will money in the bank'' for future Vietnamese- American relations.  Mr. Le says the process will take time, that Vietnam has 300,000 missing of its own, that it lacks recovery resources and that a proper American attitude would speed things. He cites as ''unhelpful'' and Reagan aides describe as ''unnecessary'' a recent House rider to provide $5 million in arms for Cambodian rebels fighting Vietnamese forces. Mr. Le said diplomatic relations, as the United States has with Laos, would be necessary for joint excavations.  The United States is known to have suggested instead that American experts survey crash and burial sites for an excavation estimate, which the Administration will pay.  ''The war is over,'' said Mr. Le. ''We want to look straight ahead to the future and a new chapter in relations between our two countries.''  Donald Shay's mother here, Sara Frances, does not like to talk about the Vietnamese authorities. For a while she wrote many foreign governments, even Laotian royalty, about her missing son, and she went to Thailand. She also immersed herself in M.I.A. league work.  Donald was home on leave in the summer of 1970 when he proposed to Jane Morris, a stewardess. They had met in college. They agreed to marry in December at the end of his photo- reconnaissance tour in Thailand.  In a conversation the next day in the Shay family's backyard on Hilltop Road under the big maple tree that had grown up with the Shay youngsters, Donald Shay's sister, now Mary Louisa Rutledge, suggested that the couple marry immediately during the leave.  Prospects of Widowhood  ''As if he could see into the future,'' Lieutenant Shay's sister recalled the other day, ''he said: 'No, we'll wait till I get back. I'd never want to make her a widow.' ''  Four months later, one month before his combat tour was to end, Donald Shay disappeared. The engagement ring arrived in the mail a few days later. Eighteen months ago Janet Morris married someone else. ''I have my own son now,'' she said, ''and I know how a mother feels.''  For several years Dr. and Mrs. Shay held out strong hopes for their only son's return. The optimism has faded. ''I no longer think I'm going to hear from him tomorrow,'' said Mrs. Shay, who still wears her son's M.I.A. bracelet. ''But I won't accept that he's dead until I hear something definitive.''  Mrs. Shay's daughter, an opponent of the war, gave up hope for her brother sooner. ''The uncertainty was like ripping off a big bandage every day,'' she said. And so the other day when her 6-year-old son, Donald, pointed at his uncle's photo in the den and asked who it was, Mrs. Rutledge didn't say anything about M.I.A.'s or P.O.W.'s or Government negotiations or radar screens. ''That's Mommy's brother,'' she said. ''He's not living anymore.''

"   , Thailand, June 8   Vietnam's official radio said today that United States hostility ''would only do harm to efforts seeking Americans missing in action'' in the Vietnam War.  The Hanoi radio broadcast said allegations that Vietnam had tortured American captives and forced them to work in labor camps were groundless.  The United States authorities say 2,441 servicemen and 42 civilians are listed as missing in Indochina. Hanoi has repeatedly said that it holds no more American prisoners of war.  President Reagan said Thursday that Vietnam must give the ''fullest possible accounting'' of American missing in action before normalization of United States-Vietnamese relations can be considered.

"   , Indonesia, June 29   The United States and Vietnam appear willing to consider opening an American technical office in Hanoi to hasten the process of accounting for American servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, according to statements from both countries.  The Reagan Administration, in a statement issued by the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, made it clear that such a move would depend on a ''significantly'' higher level of Vietnamese cooperation in the search for missing Americans.  The proposal has been discussed with both Hanoi and Washington by Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who has been serving as go-between with Vietnam for the non-Communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations in its efforts to resolve the problem of Cambodia.  In an interview Friday, Mr. Mochtar said that although Washington was reluctant to establish any presence in Hanoi that might be misconstrued as the beginning of diplomatic recognition, the idea of a technical office was ''very much'' alive.  No Need Seen Now  The American statement issued in Bangkok said there appeared to be no necessity at this time for a technical office. But it added:  ''Were circumstances to change, and Vietnam's cooperation to increase significantly in such a way as to require the more frequent or even continuous deployment of technical personnel, we would give it serious consideration. This would, of course, have no relation to the issue of diplomatic relations.''  Tran Ngoc Thach, a spokesman for the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok, confirmed that the idea was under consideration but said it had not been directly discussed between the two countries.  The United States, which has no official presence in Hanoi, says progress on the issue of the missing Americans, along with the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, are prerequisites to better relations. A decade after the end of the Vietnam War, more than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in Indochina, 1,375 of them in Vietnam.  The opening of an American technical office in Hanoi, which Mr. Mochtar said the Vietnamese are actively seeking, would establish the first permanent American presence in the country in a decade.  No Full-Time U.S. Groups  Some Americans - among them scholars and scientists, Congressional delegations, journalists and experts from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii - travel to Vietnam on short visits, but no American organizations work full time there.  Mr. Mochtar, who made a series of trips to Hanoi and Washington earlier this year, says he has come to believe that the conflict in Cambodia stands a better chance of being resolved within the context of improved United States-Vietnamese relations. For this reason, he has been trying to bring about better relations between Hanoi and Washington.  The Foreign Minister is preparing for a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and the foreign ministers of Asean, in which the members are Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.  Mr. Mochtar said Friday that he thought Hanoi should concentrate its efforts on the issue of missing Americans as a humanitarian concern and stop viewing it as a bargaining chip.  'Help Them to Help You'  He said he recently told Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, that Vietnam had to be ''forthcoming, or at least seem to be forthcoming on this, so you can turn the tide, which is now running against you.''  ''I know the Americans,'' he said he told the Vietnamese. ''Basically, they are fair. There are still people there who are sympathetic to you. Help them to help you. Make it possible to proceed.  ''The Vietnamese are their own biggest enemy,'' he said, ''because while they are willing to move, publicly they always feel that have to be tough.''  Vietnam, which earlier this year agreed to increase the two nations' consultations on the missing from four a year to six, a few weeks ago abruptly postponed a meeting tentatively scheduled for this month. The talks have been rescheduled for next Wednesday through Friday, according to a Pentagon announcement circulating here. Both sides hope the meeting might in clude the first joint examination of a wartime crash site.  Progress Is Reported  The Vietnamese and the Americans who are close to the talks on the missing had both been reporting encouraging progress.  American officials say the idea of a technical office in Hanoi was first proposed in 1973, the year most American troops were withdrawn and two years before the takeover of Saigon by the North Vietnamese.  According to Americans who were involved with the plan, Hanoi first agreed, then later withdrew its approval. The subject has not been reported to have seriously been raised since then.  Mr. Mochtar said Friday that he was encouraged by the recent American statements that did not rule out a technical office.  ''This news, if it is true, is a very welcome development,'' he said. ''Then we can go somewhere.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",June 29 1985 ,2
"      Vietnam has offered to hold high-level talks with the United States to resolve questions within two years on Americans missing in action, State Department officials said today.  The Hanoi offer, conveyed by Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja of Indonesia four days ago, has received a skeptical response from some Administration officials, who regard it as a possible Hanoi maneuver to deflect attention from repeated criticism of its occupation of Cambodia.  There was also strong suspicion voiced by some officials that the offer was made at this time, virtually on the eve of the annual meeting of the chief non-Communist nations of Southeast Asia, to make Hanoi appear conciliatory, after months of being condemned for its military activity along the Thai-Cambodian border.  Nevertheless, the Administration said it would study the offer to see if it represented a sincere desire by Vietnam to end the continuing problem of the more than 2,400 Americans still listed as missing in action in Indochina, of which some 1,375 are believed to be missing in Vietnam.  'An Enormous Advance'  Officials traveling with Secretary of State George P. Shultz in Hong Kong said the offer appeared ''to be an enormous advance over what has been done so far.''  Since the capture of Saigon by the Communists in 1975, the United States has been calling for a full accounting of the missing in action. The Vietnamese, who have repeatedly said they have no interest in making an issue out of the question, have nonetheless been slow about returning the remains of Americans who died in Vietnam and are still listed as missing.  There has been one report, which is given credence by American officials, that the remains of at least 400 Americans are in a Vietnamese warehouse.  Administration officials long ago concluded that they did not believe any Americans were still alive in Vietnam, but the search for the remains of the Americans has continued.  Concern Over Chinese Influence  Mr. Mochtar, who is one of the most eager of the Southeast Asian leaders to seek an easing of tensions with Vietnam, has been urging for some time active high-level talks between Washington and Hanoi. He has said that if such talks could be held, this might lead to resolution of the missing-in-action issue and eventually provide the impetus for diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam.  Earlier, Mr. Mochtar had proposed that Hanoi and Washington agree on establishing an American technical mission in Hanoi in an effort to step up the recovery of remains. It was not clear if the Hanoi message was a response to that proposal.  Indonesia is concerned about a resurgence of Chinese influence in the region and would like Vietnam to be a buffer, but recognizes that Vietnam should first pull out of Cambodia.  Administration officials said today that no consideration would be given to diplomatic relations with Vietnam until it agreed to withdraw from Cambodia. ----U.S. Says It Is Interested HONG KONG, Sunday, July 7 - A senior official traveling with Secretary of State Shultz said today that the United States was willing to hold high-level talks with Vietnam but that the United States continued to insist on a settlement in Cambodia as a condition for improving relations with Hanoi.  The official said a new proposal made by Vietnam to hold talks aimed at resolving the issue of missing Americans within two years appeared ''to be an enormous advance over what has been done so far'' in determining the fate of the more than 2,400 Americans still listed as missing in Indochina. ----Inquiry on Remains Demanded SAN FRANCISCO, July 6 (AP) - A Florida woman demanding independent identification of 13 American servicemen killed in a 1972 plane crash in Laos has won a federal court order barring the Air Force from returning their remains to relatives.  Ann Hart of Pensacola, Fla., the widow of one of the servicemen, obtained the temporary restraining order late Friday night. The remains were received at Travis Air Force Base Friday night.

"    LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 10   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today that the Reagan Administration was ready to work ''promptly and decisively'' with Vietnam to resolve the issue of missing Americans.  In his first public response to a request for ''high level'' talks on the issue passed from Hanoi to Washington last week by Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja of Indonesia, Mr. Shultz said at a news conference at the United States Embassy here today:  ''I think the next step for us is - as we will be doing - to organize the kind of group we think would be best able to respond and to let them know in Hanoi that we'd like to start to work on this problem. We want to work at it as promptly and decisively as possible.''  Mr. Shultz's comments followed a decision by Vietnam last week to turn over the remains of 26 Americans thought to have died in Indochina. This was the largest repatriation of remains of M.I.A.'s - missing in action - announced since 1975, when South Vietnam fell to the armies of the North, two years after the withdrawal of American forces. More than 2,400 Americans are still listed as missing in Indochina, over half of them in Vietnam.  Criticizes Congress on Cambodia  In his remarks today, Mr. Shultz was also critical of Congress for what he called its ''changeability'' as he expressed the Administration's reservations about Congressional efforts to provide non-Communist forces battling Vietnamese troops in Cambodia with $5 million that could be used for military aid. The measure was approved by the House of Representatives on Tuesday.  ''I think we're going to have greater success in our program if we keep it the way it is now,'' he said, referring to the Administration's limiting of aid to mostly humanitarian expenditures.  ''Congress is a very changeable operation,'' he said. ''They are in favor of something at one time and then some things can happen and they can change their mind and you've got a program that's working that gets derailed. We'd like to avoid that.''  Mr. Shultz is in Kuala Lumpur for annual consultations with ministers of the member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.  The Secretary, asked by reporters to clear up a misunderstanding about whether he had brought Thailand a new letter of support from President Reagan, said he had not presented such a document to Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda when they met in Bangkok on Monday. But he indicated that the subject had come up in their conversation when the Thai leader referred to an letter Mr. Reagan sent last April. The letter pledged backing for Thailand in the face of what both countries view as Vietnam's threatening presence in Cambodia.  In his answers to questions at the news conference, he indicated that the United States was prepared to deal with Vietnam directly at a high level. Officials traveling in the Shultz party have suggested that Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, might be among officials likely to visit Hanoi, with which the United States has no formal diplomatic relations.  Indonesian Is Thanked  Mr. Shultz thanked Foreign Minister Mochtar of Indonesia, with whom he will meet privately Thursday, for his efforts in ''supporting our concerns about the M.I.A.-P.O.W. issue.'' He added that on the larger issue of diplomatic ties, Washington would prefer to act on its own.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",July 10 1985 ,2
"      THERE was optimism last week among many Government officials - and among surviving family members - that the mystery of 2,464 Americans still unaccounted for after the war in Indochina may be closer to resolution.  A United States-sponsored research group that completed a three-day mission in Hanoi early this month reported that the Vietnamese had promised to return the remains of 26 American servicemen and ''material evidence'' regarding the fate of six others. It would be the largest such turnover in the 10 years since the fighting ended.  Potentially more significant, members of the group reported, the Vietnamese took them to a B-52 crash site outside of Hanoi, and left the impression they may be willing, after years of entreaties, to permit a search of the wreckage of other downed aircraft.  The Pentagon believes there are ''several hundred'' such crash sites in Vietnam that may contain enough evidence to close the books on many of the 1,820 missing in that country.  A week earlier, another American team completed its first excavation in Laos, where 556 Americans remain on the missing list. A two-week sifting of a nearly obliterated AC-130 gunship shot down in 1972 produced 13 identifiable sets of remains.  Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense for international security affairs, said that so far the Vietnamese had made no commitment to allow American teams in, but he regarded the B-52 visit as ''an indication that they're certainly leaning in that direction.''  Signal of a Policy Decision  The developments came after a Vietnamese proposal to open talks aimed at resolving questions about the missing Americans within two years.  ''We've never before had this large a turnover, or any kind of a time commitment,'' said Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of P.O.W.-M.I.A. Families. ''It signals a policy decision on their part, and we obviously welcome that.'' ''That doesn't mean we're near the end,'' she added.  Nor does it touch on the matter of whether any Americans are still in captivity in Vietnam. A special House committee concluded in 1976 that ''no Americans are still being held alive as prisoners in Indochina, or elsewhere, as a result of the war in Indochina.''  The chairman of the panel, Representative G. V. Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, still gets periodic briefings from Pentagon intelligence specialists.  ''They can't give me a name,'' Mr. Montgomery said last week. ''They can't give me strong evidence.'' A panel appointed by President Carter also concluded that there were no captives.  The Nature of the 'Evidence'  The Administration has been less inclined to rule out that possibility. The official view today, Mr. Armitage said, is: ''We act under the assumption that there is at least one American held against his will in Indochina.''  The ''evidence'' regarding captives appears to consist almost entirely of reports from Vietnamese refugees who say they once saw what they thought were Americans. The Pentagon has recorded 774 such reported sightings; so far, most of the eyewitness accounts either have involved Americans who returned or have been discounted, sometimes with the assistance of lie-detector tests, as fabrications.  That leaves 123 sightings still being examined, according to officials.  Col. Gerald S. Venanzi, a former prisoner of the Vietnamese who is the Pentagon's senior adviser on P.O.W. and M.I.A. affairs, said there is little even in those active files to raise hopes.  Very few of the witnesses mention talking to the alleged American captives. Half are sightings of white men not under guard - possibly Russian advisers, European diplomats or reporters. Only two of the reported sightings have taken place since 1980, and 18 were before the fall of Saigon.  ''A lot among that 123 are just so vague that there is no place to go with them,'' Colonel Venanzi said. ''There's nothing I'd want to take to the store and say, 'This is it, boss.' ''  Still, he is convinced ''there's a lot to investigate.'' The M.I.A. search office told Congress last month it has ''a virtually unlimited budget'' for the cause.  Some critics feel the Administration has exploited the missing Americans. Every year, families of the missing servicemen have been airlifted to Washington for P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day - some 800 are expected to fly in at Government expense for a gathering on Friday. On such occasions, the hope has been encouraged that some of the missing will emerge alive.  To those who say such displays raise false hope or smack too much of political showmanship, Mr. Armitage replies that they have paid off, perhaps convincing Hanoi that any hope of normal diplomatic relations depends on as full a reckoning as possible.  No one expects that all of the missing Americans will ever be accounted for. Many are presumed to have crashed into the sea or dense jungle, and the tropical climate quickly destroys evidence.  About 8,100 Americans still remain unaccounted for from the Korean war, and more than 78,000 from World War II, where the United States had the victor's advantage of unimpeded access to former battlefields and crash sites.  At what point will the Administration be satisfied?  Said Mr. Armitage: ''It's kind of like enlightenment. You know when you're there.''

"      The United States proposed to Vietnam today that an American delegation go to Hanoi to discuss Vietnam's recent offer to resolve the missing-in-action issue, a State Department spokesman said.  The department spokesman, Bernard Kalb, said the proposed delegation would include officials from the Defense and State Departments, the National Security Council and the executive director of the National League of Families. He said he could not name the delegation members.  According to Mr. Kalb, there will be no change in United States policy toward Vietnam. There are 2,464 Americans still listed as missing in action in Southeast Asia, most of them in Vietnam.  The proposal was issued today through the United States Embassy in Bangkok in response to a Vietnamese offer, made in July, to resolve the issue within two years.

"      A United States delegation scheduled to meet with Vietnamese officials to discuss the fate of missing American servicemen postponed its departure for Hanoi today after learning that Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach would not be present for the meetings next week.  The Vietnamese Government announced in July that it was prepared to resolve within two years the question of Americans missing in action, and wanted to hold high-level talks to discuss it. Nearly 2,500 Americans are listed as missing in the Indochina war, more than half of them in Vietnam.  The American delegation that had been scheduled to leave Saturday planned to spend two days in Hanoi and half a day in Laos.  A State Department statement said only that the delegation ''may have to reschedule'' the trip because of ''some difficulty in scheduling participation on the Vietnamese side.''  A senior Administration official said Mr. Thach's participation was considered crucial. Mr. Thach was in Indonesia this week and there were unconfirmed reports he had gone on to Moscow. The official said there was hope that the Vietnamese would offer ''clarification'' and that the delegation could leave with a delay of only a day or two.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 28   Vietnam offered a two-year plan today to resolve the issue of nearly 1,400 Americans missing in action in the Vietnam War.  Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son told reporters Vietnam would welcome United States aid in financing the search for remains, but had not requested it. He said the American side brought up the possibility of financing searches for missing soldiers.  He did not give details of the Vietnam plan and said the American delegation had submitted its own proposals.  Mr. Son and five other Vietnamese officials met in Hanoi with a four-member United States delegation headed by Richard Childress, a member of the National Security Council. Also in the team is Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 29   The head of an American delegation said today that the United States and Vietnam were working on a unified plan to account for nearly 1,400 Americans still missing in the Vietnam War.  Vietnamese officials have pledged to resolve the issue of the missing soldiers in ''a very short time,'' said Richard Childress, a member of the National Security Council.  Mr. Childress would not give details of the plans under discussion, but he said there were common features in the proposals submitted at the talks. He described the negotiations as ''very substantive.'' The talks ended today.  Col.

"      The Reagan Administration said today that talks last week with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi were ''the most positive'' to date in the 12-year effort to resolve the problem of Americans unaccounted for in the Vietnam War.  A State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said that ''I am pleased to state that the talks were very productive'' and that the meeting ''took place in a constructive atmosphere.''  Last Wednesday and Thursday, a four-member United States team led by Richard Childress, the political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff, met with the acting Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Vo Dong Giang, and with Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son.  Originally, a higher-level American delegation, led by Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, had been scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach. But when Mr. Thach informed Washington on Aug. 23 that he had to travel to Moscow, Mr. Armitage and Mr. Wolfowitz canceled plans at the last minute to fly to Hanoi.  The assumption at that time in Washington was that the Vietnamese, who at first had proposed ''high-level talks'' to resolve the question of unaccounted-for Americans ''in two years,'' were having second thoughts. The lower-level Childress mission was authorized to have ''technical talks.''  State Department officials said today that Mr. Childress, who was accompanied by Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, was surprised to find the Vietnamese officials ready, even at the secondary level, to discuss for the first time all aspects of the issue.  ''This was the first time that we had a totally nonpolemical discussion with the Vietnamese,'' a State Department official said. ''They did not raise any preconditions for cooperation.'' In previous meetings, Hanoi had indicated that progress on the missing-in-action issue depended on the United States improving relations with Vietnam or granting it foreign aid.  Neither issue was raised this time, but American officials believe that Hanoi still hopes to achieve both.  During the talks, Mr. Redman said, the United States conveyed to the Vietnamese ''an outline of a process to resolve the issue in Vietnam within two years.'' Vietnam ''presented its own plan to resolve the issue in a short time.''  'A Number of Common Elements'  ''There are a number of common elements between the two concepts,'' he said.  A total of 1,820 Americans in Vietnam are carried on one of two rolls - those who were at one time listed as prisoners of war, or missing in action, and those who were believed to be killed in action but whose bodies have not been recovered. Despite movies that portray Americans being held in Vietnam, State Department officials said there is no evidence to indicate that any are alive. But there is a desire, they said, to clear up questions raised by reported sightings of Westerners who could be Americans.  According to State Department officials, the United States suggested a three-part approach to the Vietnamese: first, to obtain the release of any prisoners or at least to resolve the issue of live prisoners; second, for the Vietnamese to step up their efforts to recover the remains of dead Americans; and third, to undertake surveys and excavations in areas where the United States believes remains may be found.  The thrust of the American plan, a State Department official said, was for joint American-Vietnamese efforts, with American teams being allowed to observe the Vietnamese efforts and to aid in the search.  The Vietnamese, in their plan, put the stress on increased Vietnamese efforts and showed little enthusiasm for joint teams, but did not rule the idea out, an official said.  Hanoi Denies G.I.'s Are Alive  Hanoi denies that any missing Americans are still alive, officials said.  The most contentious issue deals with the Vietnamese turning over remains. Washington believes that Hanoi has stored the remains of hundreds of Americans, some of which it returns periodically to the United States. Most recently, Hanoi turned over the remains of 26 Americans. Altogether, Vietnam has returned the remains of 99 men.  State Department officials said the Vietnamese seem much more determined to deal with the question of the unaccounted-for Americans. ''They know they have to do so to improve relations with us,'' one State Department official said.  ''We believe the talks were the most positive step yet in the ongoing process toward resolution of this issue,'' Mr. Redman said.  Ever since the cease-fire agreement was signed in 1973 on ending the Vietnam War, the United States has been seeking a full accounting of its men in Vietnam. But the effort has had the highest priority in the Reagan Administration, which was critical of the way past administrations dealt with the question.  The United States has said it would not improve relations with Hanoi until the missing-in-action question was resolved and until Hanoi withdrew its forces from Cambodia. The Vietnamese have occupied Cambodia since crushing the Communist Government of Pol Pot in early 1979 but have recently said they foresaw pulling out by 1990. There are believed to be about 160,000 Vietnamese in Cambodia bolstering the Government of Heng Samrin.  U.S. Comments on Pol Pot  In another development, the State Department said it would be ''a positive step'' if Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, has actually retired from active command of his forces. Since the Vietnamese victory over his forces in 1979, Mr. Pol Pot has led the Khmer Rouge in a continuing insurgency, with the aid of China. There are two non-Communist rebel groups in Cambodia, one led by the former chief of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the other by Son Sann, a former official in the old Cambodian Government.  Because the Pol Pot regime has been charged with the deaths of more than two million Cambodians during its rule, the United States and most other countries have had no contact with it.

"      Although the United States is sending a high-level delegation to Hanoi next week, there has been no visible movement toward formal diplomatic relations.  Officials believe Hanoi is ready for normal relations, partly as a balance with its involvement with the Soviet Union, but also to rebuff China and to obtain American investment in such fields as offshore oil exploration. Vietnamese officials have welcomed private Americans who have urged reconciliation and exchange programs. A group of educators is to visit Vietnam this week, for example, to lay the groundwork for a teacher exchange.  But more than 10 years after the end of the Vietnam War, the United States continues to resist diplomatic relations, citing as the latest obstacle the presence of an estimated 140,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Hanoi, which invaded in 1978, accuses China of having used Cambodia as a surrogate to attack Vietnam.  ''We will not normalize until this is resolved to allow the Khmer people to have free choice,'' Richard L. Armitage, Assistant Secretary of Defense, said in a recent interview.  Highest Delegation Since '77  Mr. Armitage is going to Hanoi with Paul D. Wolfowitz, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and with Richard Childress, political and military affairs director of the National Security Council staff at the White House.  It is the highest-level delegation since 1977, when Leonard Woodcock, then president of the United Auto Workers, was sent by President Carter to explore opening diplomatic relations. Those efforts fell victim to a series of events in 1978, including the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the establishment of Chinese-American relations.  The talks next week are to focus on the other major issue between Hanoi and Washington: accounting for Americans missing in action.  ''The Vietnamese have indicated greater cooperation on this issue than was evident heretofore,'' Mr. Armitage said.  In recent months, he said, Vietnam has returned remains of Americans at a faster rate and has allowed an American team to search a B-52 crash site, the first of a series to be explored.  Plan Presented by Hanoi  In August, Mr. Armitage said, Vietnamese officials presented the United States with a plan to obtain and provide as much information on the missing as possible by the end of 1987. Consequently, the Administration has adopted the view that accounting for the missing is ''not a precondition to any sort of normalization,'' as Mr. Armitage put it.  In a wider sense, however, it has political impact on American attitudes.  ''They know fully and without a doubt that this issue is not going to go away,'' Mr. Armitage said. ''It is not a precondition. But it is a simple fact of life that the American people will not stand for normalization until this problem is resolved.''  The lingering preoccupation with the missing and the unwillingness to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam are seen by some Americans as symptoms of an inability to heal the wounds of war.  ''For Americans, there is no closure,'' said John McAuliff, director of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, a program of the SANE Education Fund. ''There has begun to be individual closure, with individuals making the trip back to Vietnam. But more important, there is no societal closure in which one can really say things are back to normal, the country is at peace.''  A Former Antiwar Activist  Mr. McAuliff, who was interviewed before heading for Vietnam with the educators, is one of several antiwar activists who have turned their efforts to improving American-Vietnamese ties. He believes that formal relations would have concrete benefits for both sides.  Diplomatic recognition by Washington, he said, ''would encourage sectors of the Vietnamese Government that take a more reformist and liberal approach and a more trusting approach to their people.''  There could also be joint research, he said, into the effects of dioxin, a toxic chemical contained in the defoliant Agent Orange, which was used by United States forces in Vietnam.  Dioxin has been found in the soil of some American communities. Its effect on health could be measured by examining South Vietnamese residents who have high levels in their bodies, Mr. McAuliff said. Effect on Vietnamese in U.S.  He said normalization would also make it possible for Vietnamese living in the United States to visit Vietnam and would have an effect on their politics here.  ''As long as there is not normalization,'' Mr. McAuliff said, ''it kind of feeds the hopes of the right-wing activists in the Vietnamese community that they can somehow stage a return. Once the U.S. recognizes that there is a single, unified Vietnam, it really does say to people, 'Look, you have to make your lives here now.' ''  From Vietnam's standpoint, American officials and Asian diplomats observe, relations with Washington could help an ailing economy. The present trade embargo inhibits Vietnam's purchase of spare parts for American equipment left behind at the end of the war. It has also created a vacuum into which the Soviet Union has stepped with an estimated $1 billion a year in aid.  Since North Vietnamese troops rolled into Saigon in April 1975 and the last Americans left in helicopters from the United States Embassy roof, Vietnam has been drawn into a relationship of both dependence on and wariness of the Soviet Union. Dependent for aid to its flagging economy and military strength against a hostile China, it has entered into elaborate trade, diplomatic and military agreements with Moscow.  Determined to Be Autonomous  But Vietnamese officials also emphasize their determination to remain autonomous, an effort that took several forms in the first years after 1975. One was a demand for United States ''reparations'' for damage caused in the war as a condition for diplomatic ties.  One Hanoi official recently said that condition was ''a mistake'' and had infuriated Americans. The demand was dropped in December 1977.  In addition, Vietnam initially resisted Soviet pressure to use American-built military bases in Cam Ranh Bay, Da Nang and elsewhere. The aversion has diminished over the years, and the Russians have gradually gained a military presence.  According to Mr. Armitage, an average of 25 Soviet Navy vessels, including submarines, are moored in Cam Ranh Bay at any given time. MIG-23 jet fighters and long-range aircraft are based there and at Da Nang, he said, with the MIG's scheduled to be turned over to the Vietnamese.  Still, in conversations with Westerners, Vietnamese officials stress their desire not to become to the Soviet Union what the Philippines are to the United States, an allusion to the freedom of the United States to use bases in the Philippines as it wishes.  Fear of China Is Deep  But Vietnam's fear of China, rooted deeply in history, keeps Hanoi close to Moscow and is used as an argument to keep Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. Some Americans note the long historical record of Vietnam's trying to expand into Cambodia.  But Vietnamese officials see two ways out: building up their allied Cambodian forces until they are able to of maintain a pro-Vietnamese regime in power, or arriving at some political solution involving the Cambodian anti-Vietnamese guerrillas that would permit Vietnamese withdrawal before 1990, when Hanoi has said its troops will depart.  For the moment, at least, this has frozen the Vietnamese-American relationship.  ''They will only withdraw,'' Mr. Armitage insisted, ''if they have succeeded in their plan to suborn Khmer culture. I don't think that's possible. They tried that in the 1800's.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 2 1986 ,2
"    The United States and Vietnam do not agree about much, but Hanoi has evidently accepted Washington's insistence that it must cooperate in accounting for the 1,797 Americans listed as missing in the war that ended in 1975. This week, the most senior United States officials to visit Hanoi in eight years are to meet with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thac to lay the groundwork for closing the books.  The Vietnamese ''have evidenced greater cooperation on this issue'' of late, said Richard L. Armitage, an Assistant Secretary of Defense.  He will be accompanied to Hanoi by Assistant Secretary of State Paul D. Wolfowitz; Richard Childress, a senior National Securitry Council aide, and Anne Mills Griffith of the League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. Mr. Childress and Mrs. Griffith went to Vietnam in September for talks that the State Department said had been the ''most positive'' to date.  In November, Americans and Vietnamese searched a site near Hanoi where a B-52 bomber crashed in 1972. However, bone fragments that they unearthed are believed unlikely to help identify missing Americans.  Vietnam has said it wants to clear up the issue of the missing, presumably to pave the way for diplomatic relations with Washington and to mitigate its dependence on the Soviet Union, which provides $1 billion a year in aid.  Washington, however, insists that relations cannot begin until the estimated 140,000 Vietnamese soldiers occupying Cambodia are removed. ''We will not normalize,'' Mr. Armitage said, ''until this is resolved to allow the Khmer people to have free choice.''  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 5 1986 ,2
"   , Vietnam, Tuesday, Jan. 7   Two days of high-level talks between the United States and Vietnam on the issue of Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War ended today with both sides expressing satisfaction with negotiations but calling for quicker progress on unresolved cases.  It was announced that a round of technical discussions would take place late next month to consider what the Vietnamese described as 50 new reports of remains. The two sides also talked about the opening of an American technical office here but decided such a move was unnecessary at this point, according to the American side.  The United States delegation, the highest to come to Vietnam since the war, was led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, who spoke to reporters after the final session today. He was joined at the news conference by Hoang Bich Son, the Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, who headed Hanoi's delegation.  Meeting With Foreign Minister  The Americans met earlier this morning with Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach. Mr. Thach, leaving the Foreign Ministry guest house, a former French colonial governor's palace, said that while both sides were pleased with the discussions, they sought quicker progress.  Mr. Son said later that a two-year timetable for resolving the question of missing Americans, which Vietnam announced in July, would now go into effect. But he and Mr. Thach said they hoped the issue could be resolved in less than two years.  The United States has made a fuller accounting of missing Americans a prerequisite for better relations with Vietnam. A total of 1,797 Americans are unaccounted for in Vietnam and around its shores.  Talks on Prisoners of War  While the United States has largely agreed with Vietnam that there is almost no likelihood that any missing Americans are still alive, there have been repeated reports in the United States of evidence that some Americans are being held prisoner.  The issue of prisoners of war was raised this morning, according to Foreign Minister Thach. ''I have assured them that there is no one alive in our hands,'' he said.  Officials said the atmosphere around the talks had been businesslike and devoid of ceremony.  Over the last year both the Vietnamese and the Reagan Administration have said they have been encouraged by progress on the issue of the missing Americans. In July the Vietnamese returned the remains of 26 Americans killed during the war, most of them downed airmen.  In November Hanoi allowed the first joint excavation of an American B-52 crash site near Hanoi.  The United States delegation at the talks here included Paul D. Wolfowitz, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; Richard K. Childress of the National Security Council, and Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families, which represents the relatives of missing Americans.  Also in the delegation were Col. Howard Hill of the Defense Department and M. Lyall Breckon, director of the State Department's Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia section.  The Vietnamese Delegates  The Vietnamese delegation included Mr. Son; Nguyen Dy Nien, an Assistant Foreign Minister; Tran Hoan, director of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's North American Department, and Nguyen Can, the Deputy Director of North American Affairs.  The United States had insisted that the meeting be confined to the issue of missing Americans. The Vietnamese sought to broaden the discussions to other issues holding up American diplomatic recognition of Hanoi.  Washington has said there will be no diplomatic relations or economic help until Vietnamese troops leave Cambodia. Hanoi toppled the Khmer Rouge Government there seven years ago today and now occupies the country with more than 150,000 troops.  Hanoi is openly acknowledging that it would like to link the opening of any American liaison office in Hanoi with the opening of a Vietnamese mission in Washington.  Hanoi Seeks Warmer Ties  On Saturday, Vo Dong Giang, a Minister of State at the Vietnamese Foreign Office, told reporters that it was only fair that if the Americans were present in Hanoi, the Vietnamese should be present in Washington.  Asian officials and diplomats based in Hanoi said the Vietnamese attached great importance to the meeting with the Americans because Hanoi needed to improve relations with Washington for several reasons.  Diplomats describe the Vietnamese leadership as uncomfortable in an exclusive alliance with the Soviet Union.  The Vietnamese, they say, would like to be able to play Washington and Moscow off against each other in the region, where both Soviet and American strategic interests are at stake.  Vietnam would also like warmer relations with China, which would give Hanoi even more leverage in dealing with the great powers, diplomats say.  Reconstruction Is Aim  In a meeting with reporters on Monday while the first session of the talks was in progress, Mr. Giang, the Minister of State, was asked why Vietnam wanted better relations with Washington. ''We do not want to improve relations only with Washington,'' he said. ''We want to improve relations with all the people around us because we need a peaceful framework for reconstruction.''  There are those close to Hanoi who contend that Vietnam, now one of the world's poorest countries, continues to hold out hope for some kind of American reparations for the war or at least for American help in development.  But even without recompense, Vietnam appears to believe that it would gain substantially from United States recognition in terms of unofficial aid from American and international organizations. A number of private American humanitarian organizations say they would like to aid the Vietnamese but have been blocked by the diplomatic situation.

"   , Thailand, Jan. 12   While American and Vietnamese officials expressed satisfaction last week with the atmosphere of good will surrounding two days of high-level talks in Hanoi on Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War, both sides agreed that they had reached a time when building confidence and increasing cooperation would be critical.  Material progress will have to be made, they said, if the issue of the missing is no longer to prevent better relations between the two countries.  There are potential problems on both sides, officials said, and the wide attention paid to the negotiations, which produced no breakthroughs, could sharpen divisions.  Wants U.S. to 'Leave Us Alone'  Not all Vietnamese leaders favor cooperation with the United States.  Asked by reporters last Monday what he most wanted from Washington, Vo Dong Giang, the second-highest ranking official in the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, said, ''We would like the U.S. to leave us alone and stop assisting China in the latter's efforts to undermine us.''  During the talks last week, it became clear, officials said, that the Vietnamese had rejected American proposals made last summer for a joint plan of action on the missing.  The Vietnamese, apparently unwilling to share too much information related to their own national security, did pledge, however, to begin this month their own two-year program to account for as many Americans as possible. Anti-American language has been absent from public pronouncements.  The leader of the Vietnamese delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son, said in a meeting with reporters at the end of the discussions that Hanoi had already begun an ''educational campaign'' in the countryside that had produced 50 new reports of possible American war dead. He said the reports would be presented to an American-Vietnamese technical meeting in Hanoi at the end of February.  U.S. Show of Good Will  Hanoi has said publicly that the Vietnamese people could not be persuaded to help look for missing Americans until the United States showed more good will toward Vietnam.  The United States Defense Department, which lists 1,797 American soldiers and civilians unaccounted for in Vietnam or off its coasts, promised in return to assist Hanoi with information or equipment needed for searches.  On their side, the Americans have to contend with what they call the ''Rambo factor'' in the United States. United States officials said private crusades, often couched in what they termed a crude anti-Communism that diplomats and American military officers dealing with the issue of the war-dead say they abhor, threatened to undermine years of low-key efforts that seem ready to produce results.  Diplomats in Hanoi said repeated private assertions by Americans that Hanoi is still holding, possibly under conditions of extreme deprivation or even torture, scores of Americans on the missing list were particularly rankling to the Vietnamese.  Possibility Not Ruled Out  United States officials said they were not ruling out the possibility that some of the missing Americans might still be alive in Vietnam. But American officials said they were seeking ways to allow the Vietnamese to save face in acounting for any such Americans.  European diplomats in Hanoi who regularly check reports of sightings of Americans are virtually unanimous in doubting that there are many, if any, prisoners held by Vietnam. But they said the chances were good that there were some deserters living in Vietnamese villages.  Diplomatic ways are also being sought to recover war dead that most Americans close to the issue say they believe are already in the possession of the Vietnamese.  Asian diplomats said it would be extremely embarrassing for Hanoi to be seen in the eyes of the world as having hoarded American bodies more than a decade after the war for future trade-offs.  ''We are Asians, too, and we know how they think,'' an Indonesian said. ''The Vietnamese now understand that they have dissipated the good will they had in the developing world with their occupation of Cambodia. They can't get away with using these bodies as poker chips.''  A Humanitarian Issue  Both sides have been working hard to live up to their assertions that the issue of the missing is a strictly humanitarian one and that it will not be used in the negotiations as a bargaining ploy or a means of scoring political points.  It has long been assumed by regional diplomats and officials that Hanoi would benefit most from a resolution of the issue, as Vietnam needs Western technical assistance and help in resolving the seven-year-old war in Cambodia.  Lately, however, diplomats in Hanoi have been questioning whether the seemingly deteriorating security situation in the Philippines might not be causing the United States to look more closely again at mainland Southeast Asia.  Although diplomats say Vietnam is not likely to be persuaded to eject a large Soviet military presence, as Egypt once did, Hanoi is thought to want more balanced international relationships.  ''They don't want to be another tropical fruit farm for Moscow - like Cuba,'' a European with experience in assisting the Vietnamese said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 12 1986 ,2
"      Vietnam has agreed to investigate 95 United States reports that some Americans are still being held prisoner in Indochina, senior Administration officials said today.  The officials, Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage and Assistant Secretary of State Paul D. Wolfowitz, who led an American delegation in talks in Hanoi last week, said progress report on their investigation at a meeting in Hanoi next month.  ''We have been unable thus far to prove that any Americans are being held against their will,'' Mr. Armitage said at a news conference. ''But on the information that is in our possession,'' he said, ''we act under the assumption that at least some Americans are held against their will in Indochina.''

"   , Laos, Jan. 19   A United States Congressional delegation said today that Laotian officials had rejected an appeal to allow Americans to enter Laos to help investigate possible sightings of American soldiers.  The four-member delegation reported that although the parting toasts were cordial, the talks had produced little new information on the fate of 556 Americans still listed as missing in action in Laos during the Vietnam War.  The four lawmakers, representing the Veterans Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, met for two hours with Soubanh Sritthirath, the Deputy Foreign Minister, and then for less than an hour with Foreign Minister Phoun Sipaseut.  The delegation was concluding a trip to the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. It was led by Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is chairman of the Senate committee, and included Senator Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona; Representative Bob McEwen, Republican of Ohio, and Representative Michael Bilirakis, Republican of Florida. #95 Sightings Still Stand Since the war ended in 1975, 806 ''live sightings'' of Americans in Indochina have been reported, mostly by refugees, according to United States Government records. Investigations have ruled out the possibility of living Americans in all but 95 reports, including 13 in Laos, United States officials say.  A total of 2,441 Americans are still listed as missing in action in the Indochina conflict - 556 of them in Laos, 88 in Cambodia and 1,797 in Vietnam.  Senator Murkowski said he and his colleagues had pressed the Laotians to allow independent verification of their position that no missing Americans are alive in Laos.  Senator DeConcini said he had asked that the United States be allowed to send observers with Laotian teams to the area of the sightings in Laos. Foreign Minister Phoun Sipaseut refused.  Mr. McEwen proposed that an international team from the Red Cross or the United Nations accompany Laotian searchers, but he said the Foreign Minister had bristled at the idea.  Laos Reports Wide Census  Senator Murkowski said he had suggested to the Foreign Minister that some Americans might be living in Laos but ''not in your control.''  He quoted Mr. Phoun Sipaseut as saying that his Government had conducted an extensive national census last year that found no Americans, and that notices had been distributed throughout Laos asking people for information on Americans.  ''The minister told us three times, 'There are absolutely none,' '' Senator Murkowski said.  On Saturday, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam pledged that any of the lawmakers could personally investigate any reported live sighting in Vietnam, but he said Vietnam was not holding any Americans.  Senator DeConcini said he planned to follow up on the offer. Bringing Two Children to U.S. The Congressional delegation returned today to Bangkok, Thailand, and plans to head back to Washington on Tuesday by way of Anchorage.  Two Vietnamese children will be aboard their Air Force C-135 jetliner. Acting on Senator Murkowski's appeal, Vietnam released Nguyen Van Chinh, a 10-year-old boy, and Tran Thanh Quynh, a 9-year-old girl, so they could be reunited with their mother, whom they have not seen in seven years.  Their mother, Xuan Thi Nguyen, 35, is now married to an American aircraft mechanic in Fairbanks, Alaska.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",January 19 1986 ,2
"   , Thailand, Feb. 15   A group of American members of Congress said today that Vietnamese officials had acknowledged for the first time that missing Americans might be living inside Vietnam, in remote areas not under full Government control.  They said Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son had told them that three Vietnamese teams were investigating reported sightings of Americans and had invited the United States to take part.  The members of Congress, who came here after two days in the Vietnamese capital, said Vietnamese officials also promised to return the bodies of 14 more Americans missing in action from the Vietnam War and had increased to 70 the number of missing on whom they promised reports.  ''For the first time, the Vietnamese Government is investigating a large number of live sightings,'' said Representative Gerald B. Solomon, Republican of Upstate New York, who is leading the nine-member House of Representatives task force on missing Americans and prisoners of war in Southeast Asia.  Hanoi's Position Is Modified  ''For years, Vietnam maintained that no live Americans were in Vietnam,'' he said at a news conference. ''They later changed that to say there were no live Americans under their control. But now they have moved to the position where they say that there could be live Americans that they are unaware of.''  Mr. Solomon, who met for three hours with Mr. Hoang, said the Foreign Minister had stressed that Vietnam was not holding any Americans against their will.  Another delegation member, Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of Upstate New York, said the Vietnamese had indicated that there might be Americans living in the mountains or other remote areas not under full Government control.  Representative Solomon said, ''They have invited the U.S. Government as well to participate in any of these investigations, and I think that is most significant.'' #2,441 on Missing List A total of 2,441 Americans are listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War, including 1,797 missing in Vietnam and the rest in Laos and Cambodia.  Since the United States withdrew its military forces from Indochina in 1973, there have been 806 reported ''live sightings'' of Americans in the region, most by refugees, according to Federal Government records. Federal officials say they have discounted all but 95 reports.  Representative Bob Dornan, Republican of California, said he believed Vietnam might be holding Americans to make use of their technical knowledge.  Representative Bill Hendon, Republican of North Carolina, said there was a '''great deal'' of intelligence information indicating that Americans remained in remote areas of Vietnam, but he did not elaborate.  Vietnam said early last month that it had collected about 50 new reports of missing Americans and would turn them over soon. The Congressmen said Hanoi officials have promised to hand over information on 20 additional cases, for a total of about 70.  Meanwhile, Mr. Dornan announced that the bodies of eight American servicemen recently returned by the Vietnamese have been identified by the United States Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, the military organization responsible for resolving cases of the missing. ---- No U.S. Comment on Sightings WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 - A State Department spokesman said today that there would be no comment on the findings of the Congressional delegation.  ''The U.S. has investigated every report of live sightings of Americans,'' the spokesman said. ''So far we have not been able to prove that Americans prisoners of war remain in Indochina. We cannot rule out the possibility that there are live American prisoners there, however. So we proceed on the assumption that some Americans may be held.''

"    For the first time in years, a Defense Department investigation has found that Vietnam may indeed still hold American prisoners of war. At least that is the assessment of Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., a former Director of Defense Intelligence who headed a five-month review of intelligence files on the issue. The general said last week that ''a large volume of evidence'' - mainly ''live sightings'' reported by Vietnamese refugees - points to the likelihood that Americans are still imprisoned by Hanoi.  But the current Director of Defense Intelligence was more cautious. At a news conference a day after General Tighe's remarks, Lieut. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots contended that, while the investigation pointed to the ''strong possibility'' that some Americans remain alive in Vietnam 14 years after the United States pulled out, there was no ''strong compelling evidence'' to prove it. And General Perroots, who appointed the investigative panel, refused to speculate on whether Hanoi still holds Americans prisoner or whether Americans had voluntarily remained in Southeast Asia.  Veterans' groups and families of the missing have argued that Washington has not done enough to find out what happened to the 2,430 Americans who remain unaccounted for in Indochina. Although the Vietnamese Government has repeatedly denied holding prisoners, it said earlier this year that Americans may be living in remote parts of the country.  The Pentagon announced late last week that American and Vietnamese officials would meet in Hanoi this week to talk about the missing Americans. It will be the fourth such conference this year and the eighth since the Vietnamese agreed in March 1985 to discuss the issue.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",October 5 1986 ,2
"   , Vietnam, April 10   Vietnam today turned over to the United States the bodies of 21 people believed to be missing American servicemen. It was the first repatriation of war dead this year and the third largest since 1975.  At Hanoi's international airport, an honor guard drawn from the four American military services escorted each coffin into a C-141 transport plane.  Hanoi used the occasion to warn the United States that the future of joint Vietnamese-United States efforts to resolve the issue of missing Americans could be in jeopardy.  Nguyen Can, the acting head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's North American Department, said the two-year deadline set last year by Hanoi for resolving the missing and prisoner of war issue cannot be met if there are what he called ''statements that vilify or discredit Vietnam in Washington.''

"   , Vietnam, April 12   Hanoi, saying it is disappointed that progress in the search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War has not elicited ''cooperation and good will'' from the United States, has suddenly shifted to a much harsher public stance toward Washington.  The shift, which comes after less than a year of improving relations, raises the possibility that efforts to determine the fate of more than 1,700 Americans still unaccounted for in Vietnam will be halted, according to Hanoi officials.  Recent public statements from Hanoi also indicate that the Vietnamese are becoming alarmed at signs of reinvigorated Thai-American military cooperation and the likelihood that more American support will be given to rebels fighting the Vietnamese-backed Government of Cambodia.  'A U.S. Comeback'  After Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger toured the Cambodian border area last Tuesday while on a visit to Thailand, the Vietnamese News Agency, envisioning what it called ''a U.S. comeback to Southeast Asia,'' said:  ''The military cooperation between Washington and Bangkok is increasing to the dangerous point of reopening U.S. military bases in Thailand. This dangerous policy of Bangkok is directly threatening the fundamental national interests of Thailand.''  On Thursday, Vietnam turned over to the United States the remains of 21 people believed to be missing American servicemen. It was the first repatriation of war dead this year and the third largest since 1975.  But in a meeting with reporters today, Deputy Foreign Minister Hoang Bich Son said that ''in the absence of cooperation and goodwill from the United States, a lot of obstacles could be created'' in the search for missing Americans.  The Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan has recently begun to attack American officials for what it said were statements indicating the United States was ''ready to use force, if necessary, to free any American prisoners'' in Vietnam. The attacks were apparently a reaction to testimony in Congress by Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, who said the United States would take ''appropriate action'' if it was determined that the Vietnamese Government was holding Americans in Vietnam.  Another article in Nhan Dan criticized the State Department for saying there were violations of human rights in Vietnam. The newspaper called the annual human rights report a ''brazen slander and a manifestation of the U.S. hostile attitude toward the Vietnamese people.''  ''The Washington authorities,'' the article said, ''have spent large amounts of money for propaganda campaigns against Vietnam, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in hopes of covering up the fact that they themselves are the most brazen violators of human rights in the world.''  Mr. Son, charging that the United States has rejected two sets of Vietnamese proposals for a joint agreement on solving the missing-in-action issue, today called for a written accord between the two nations. He declined to elaborate on what was in the proposals, but the Vietnamese have long sought a two-year timetable for completion of outstanding missing-persons cases.  The United States has rejected a written accord in the belief that this would hinder Washington from pursuing the issue after the time limit expired.  Mr. Son repeated a charge made earlier this week by Nguyen Can, head of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's department of North American affairs, that suggestions by some Americans that the Hanoi Government was holding live Americans had slowed the search process. Hanoi denies that there are any living Americans in the country; Mr. Son said Saturday that he had been misquoted by members of an American delegation that visited Hanoi in February. The group, led by Mr. Armitage, had reported that Mr. Son said some Americans may be living in remote areas without Hanoi's knowledge.  A loss of momentum on this issue -coming less than a year after what Washington considered to be a breakthrough with Hanoi - would follow a pattern of ill-fated efforts to resolve problems between the two nations.  Among the now-stalemated questions are the Amerasian children and ''re-education'' camp inmates who the Reagan Administration has said it would be willing to resettle in the United States. Also stalled is the Orderly Departure Program, under which Vietnamese leave their country legally for the United States and other Western nations under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Causes and Consequences  Hanoi has always taken the position that its offer last summer to resolve the missing Americans issue ''within two years'' was strictly a humanitarian gesture.  But at the same time, diplomats say, the Vietnamese may have thought that a gesture of good will on their part would quickly be reciprocated by the Americans. Diplomats are almost unanimous in saying that Hanoi still puts a very high priority on getting United States diplomatic recognition.  Diplomats also suggest that the steady succession of delegations from the United States coming to Vietnam to discuss the issue of missing Americans might have left Hanoi officials with the impression that this issue was more important to the United States than the continuing Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.  The diplomats say it is the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia that has soured relations between Hanoi and most nations outside the Soviet bloc. The United States has taken the same position: that Cambodia is the ultimate issue.  A foreigner in Phnom Penh, however, said the Vietnamese are shrewd and experienced readers of American political signals, and may think it possible to extract concessions from Washington ''by playing the M.I.A. card.''

"      Vietnam notified the United States today that it was suspending talks on resolving the question of Americans still listed as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, the State Department said.  In the official message to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Hanoi said ''the current situation is not favorable'' for holding the next meeting on the missing-in-action Americans that had been set for next Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi, Bernard Kalb, the department's spokesman, said.  But Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, at a meeting in New Delhi of the countries that describe themselves as nonaligned, said the discussions were being suspended because of the American air attacks on Libya.  The Hanoi move drew a quick warning from Washington. Mr. Kalb said this action would ''imperil any chance for improvement in the atmosphere between our two nations.''  Hanoi Pledge Cited  Noting that Hanoi had pledged last year to settle once and for all all questions dealing with the nearly 2,000 Americans still listed as unaccounted for in Vietnam, Mr. Kalb said:  ''If Vietnam now decides to abandon that pledge and to link this humanitarian enterprise to political issues, this can only increase the suffering of the families of those still missing, bring discredit to the Hanoi authorities and imperil any chance for an improvement in the atmosphere between our two nations.''  The Vietnamese have also apparently reneged on another pledge made to the United States - to turn over to the United States some 7,000 political prisoners who have been in so-called ''re-education camps.'' Many of these prisoners are Vietnamese with close ties to the United States, such as military and civilian officials in the former Saigon Government.  In 1984, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong of Vietnam said Hanoi would release these prisoners if Washington would take them. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said then that the United States would take them and their relatives over a two-year period.  Report From Ex-Governor  A report made public today by a special panel on Indochinese refugees, headed by the former Governor of Iowa, Robert D. Ray, said that when the group visited Hanoi recently, ''Foreign Minister Thach was categorical in his refusal to discuss the issue, stating that it was now 'out of the question,' to release the prisoners.''  ''We found that there is great difficulty in getting cooperation or even getting them to acknowledge what they have previously said relative to the re-education camp prisoners,'' Mr. Ray said in a news conference today.  ''They refuse to call them prisoners,'' he said.  Although American officials dealing with the issue do not believe there are any Americans still alive, they would like to get more information from the Vietnamese on what happened to Americans who were known to have been captured during the war but who were never accounted for and to recover the remains of Americans from areas where there were known to be plane crashes.  The United States at the end of 1985 listed 1,797 Americans as unaccounted for in Vietnam, 700 in the north, and 1,097 in the south. In addition, 556 are listed as unaccounted for in Laos, 82 in Cambodia, and 6 in China, for a total of 2,441.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",April 19 1986 ,2

"    A group of Vietnam veterans who marched from Washington arrived yesterday at Grant's Tomb for a vigil for 2,400 Americans still missing in Southeast Asia.  Fewer than three dozen veterans made the full march, and only about 100 people greeted them upon their arrival in Manhattan - far fewer than the 1,000 organizers had hoped to draw.  ''There's only a small amount of us who care, but we do care, and we care a lot,'' said Anthony Torres, march organizer for the New York-New Jersey POW-MIA committee. ''People saw us marching. Truck drivers saw us. This is about public awareness.''  Outside the monument, the marchers and their supporters gathered a half-block from a row of tents where many said they planned to stay in a 24-hour vigil.  They expressed a mixture of frustration and hope that prisoners of war and Americans missing in action would eventually be returned to the United States.

"   , Laos, Nov. 20   The United States and Laos announced today that Washington would begin considering the ''humanitarian problems'' of this isolated country as Laotians step up the search for Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  The agreement is similar to one concluded this past summer between the United States and Vietnam, under which American experts on the missing have already visited Hanoi for consultation.  At the same time, the United States is about to deliver a shipment of rice to Laos, where this year's crop, now being harvested, has been severely affected by drought.  The announcement today followed the first formal Laotian-American technical meeting on the search for missing Americans, held here Nov. 11-13.  It also follows a visit to Vientiane last week by David Lambertson, Deputy Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific, and a trip to Washington in October by the Laotian Deputy Foreign Minister, Soubanh Srithirath. #555 Unaccounted For in Laos Fourteen years after the United States withdrew from Indochina, 555 Americans are still unaccounted for in Laos. Most of them were shot down in bombing raids on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, along which the North Vietnamese resupplied Communist armies in the South through Laotian territory.  The United States also bombed the Plain of Jars, where Lao Communist forces were numerous.  In addition to the missing in Laos, 1,757 Americans are unaccounted for in Vietnam and 91 in Cambodia.  Laotians say they are reluctant to make the search for missing Americans a national priority when so many of their own people were killed by American bombing from 1964 to 1973. Farmers in Laotian villages are still dying and being maimed by ordnance exploding in fields.  But pressures in the United States from organizations representing the families of the missing in action and unaccounted-for prisoners of war have forced the Communist Pathet Lao Government, which seized power in 1975, to deal with the issue as a prerequisite to better relations with Washington.  Private Searches Condemned  Both Laos and the Reagan Administration have condemned private American efforts to mount searches in Laos. American opposition to these illegal forays into this country was repeated today in a joint statement, which said such ''irresponsible'' acts were impeding government-to-government cooperation.  The United States maintains diplomatic relations with Laos at the charge d'affaires level. The small American mission in Vientiane, led by Harriet W. Isom, is the only American embassy in the three Indochinese Communist countries of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  But there is no United States aid program in Laos, one of the world's poorest nations. Until recently, aid been blocked by Congress, and no funds have been authorized in a tight foreign aid budget.  Today, a joint press release from the Government of Laos and the United States Embassy said the Laotians were considering excavating by themselves a crash site in Savannakhet Province. Two previous excavations were conducted in cooperation with American teams from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii.  Trying to Resolve 3 Cases  In today's statement, the Laotians also said they were trying to resolve three cases where there are discrepancies about missing Americans. The statement gave no details, and Lao officials declined to be interviewed.  In return, the United States said it would respond ''within the limits of its capabilities'' to the humanitarian concerns of Laos.  As an example, the statement said an American non-governmental organization was considering erecting a prefabricated clinic in the area where Laos will conduct its excavation of the site of an American plane crash. The clinic would be stocked with medicines at American expense.  The statement did not specify the organization involved. The Mennonite Central Committee and the American Friends Service Committee have development programs in Laos, but those organizations said tonight that they were not the agency planning the clinic.

"      The Reagan Administration has proposed to Vietnam that Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visit Hanoi as a Presidential representative to discuss the fate of missing servicemen.  But State Department officials said the visit, which was proposed last week, would not take place unless the two nations could agree on how to move forward discussions on the issue.  ''We're not sending a Presidential envoy unless a policy-level, advance delegation goes to Hanoi first,'' Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said today.  There has been no response from the Vietnamese to the proposal, which was also presented privately last month by H. Ross Perot, the Texas industrialist who worked for the White House last year on issues relating to prisoners of war and those missing in action.  Mr. Perot's mission, which Mr. Redman said was undertaken ''at his own initiative,'' was reported today by The Washington Post.  In an interview today, Mr. Perot said the Vietnamese had been pleased by the idea of talks with General Vessey. He denounced Mr. Redman's statements, saying it was counterproductive to set conditions for the visit.  Mr. Perot said: ''They feel, and I am quoting them, that we send people over who are minor officials, who only make demands, who are rude and arrogant. A Presidential negotiator is the right answer, and Vessey is the right man.''  Mr. Redman said today that ''our difficulties in moving ahead'' on the issue are primarily due to Vietnam's refusal ''to engage in any technical or policy level talks, in order to reconfirm our understanding of the nature of the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue.''

"      A Vietnamese official said his Government had agreed to a meeting in Hanoi with John W. Vessey Jr., President Reagan's special envoy, to end an impasse in talks over the fate of missing American sevicemen, The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions.  The unnamed Vietnamese Government official said Hanoi had sent American negotiators a letter accepting the proposal of a meeting with General Vessey, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to discuss ''humanitarian'' issues.  The letter dropped the earlier insistence by the Vietnamese on preconditions for the talks, including that the discussions include such topics as the normalization of relations between the two countries if Vietnam helped account for the missing servicemen, The Post said.

"      Secretary of State George P. Shultz confirmed today that Vietnam had relented and agreed to American conditions for a meeting with a special envoy to discuss the issue of missing servicemen.  But Mr. Shultz, speaking at the annual meeting of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, also warned that there might not be much progress on the issue. He said it was good that Vietnam no longer insisted that discussions on missing servicemen be linked with the issue of normalizing relations.  ''We are pleased that the Vietnamese Government has accepted our proposal for a visit by a Presidential emissary on P.O.W. and M.I.A. and other humanitarian issues,'' he said. ''We are also pleased that Hanoi has confirmed that the two sides should not link these humanitarian issues with any outstanding political problem between our two countries.''  Earlier this month a Vietnamese official said Hanoi had sent American negotiators a letter dropping many previous conditions for talks.  Mr. Shultz warned, however, that Vietnam might still try to get economic aid in exchange for genuine discussion on the missing servicemen.  ''We intend to honor that agreement and expect Vietnam's leaders to do the same,'' he said of the understanding that normalization of relations will not be included in discussions. ''Nevertheless, in spite of these agreements, we must face the possibility that we will not be able to move the issue forward.''  Disturbed by Press Reports  He said he was disturbed by press reports that despite the agreement, Vietnam might try to raise the issue of reparations and economic aid under the heading of humanitarian cooperation.  ''Humanitarian reciprocity is one thing, but any attempt to trade information on our missing men for economic aid is another,'' he said. ''We cannot agree to this.''  An American negotiating team returned from Hanoi in May after failing to persuade Vietnam to accept the visit from the special presidential envoy, Gen. John A. Vessey Jr., retired, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  ''The Government of Vietnam has agreed to receive General Vessey to discuss the issue in Hanoi,'' Mr. Shultz said today. ''We are working out the final details with the Vietnamese now.''  No date has been set for the Vessey mission, officials said.  Foreign Minister Interviewed  His remark about press reports apparently refers to an interview with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, in The Washington Post this month from Hanoi. Mr. Thach said Vietnam intended to raise a wide variety of issues under the category of humanitarian matters, including property damage and personal injuries suffered during the Vietnam War.  ''If we can help the Americans on M.I.A.'s, then the Americans can help us heal our wounds of war,'' he said.  The United States has been seeking Vietnamese help in determining the fate of more than 2,500 American servicemen who were missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps.  American officials said Hanoi had been stalling on agreeing to the meeting in hopes that Washington would to allow the discussions to include the normalization of relations. The Vietnamese believe that normalization discussions would include the issue of reparations.  The Reagan Administration has been adamant that talks about the missing servicemen must precede any discussion of improving diplomatic relations.  Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested this week that the Administration proceed quickly with normalizing relations with Hanoi.

"      President Reagan announced today that his special envoy, Gen. John A. Vessey, would travel to Hanoi next month in an attempt to revive negotiations over missing American servicemen.  The announcement indicated that Vietnam had ended an attempt to link the high-level talks to economic assistance and political concerns, including the war in Cambodia.  A senior White House official said General Vessey, a retired officer and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would seek the resumption of technical talks on identifying the remains of missing American servicemen or prisoners of war. Vietnam broke off such talks in October, when American officials asserted that Hanoi was stalling to gain concessions on other issues.  ''Both sides have agreed that these discussions on humanitarian issues should not be linked to any outstanding normalization of relations or the Cambodian qustions,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.  The visit, which was arranged in recent weeks, will take place Aug. 1-3.  American estimates placed the number of United States servicemen who are missing from the Vietnam War or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps at 2,500. In September, the Pentagon said intelligence files and other evidence indicated that some American prisoners of war were still alive in Southeast Asia and that ''a large volume of evidence'' points to the likelihood that they are being held by the Vietnamese Government.

"      The ghosts of Vietnam haunt Senator John McCain and Colleen C. Shine. And they are not alone.  ''There is no way, absolutely no way, that we'll ever close the chapter on that unhappy part of America's history, the Vietnam War, unless we have a full accounting for those who are still listed as missing in action,'' said Senator McCain, a leader in Congress on the issue. The Arizona Republican, a former Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi in 1967, spent nearly six years in a prisoner-of-war camp and knew ''a couple of guys'' still listed as missing.  For Colleen C. Shine, the issue of the missing is more wrenching. ''My father, Lieut. Col. Anthony C. Shine, was shot down on the border between North Vietnam and Laos on Dec. 2, 1972,'' she said quietly. ''I was eight years old then. I have a memory of him. He's still unaccounted for.''  The Vessey Mission  From this vantage point, Senator McCain and numerous Congressional colleagues, as well as Ms. Shine, the public affairs coordinator for the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, gaze with wary hope at one of the highest-level efforts by the Reagan Administration to discuss the issue of missing American servicemen in Southeast Asia.  From Saturday through Monday, a mission headed by Gen. John A. Vessey, and including senior Defense and State Department officials, will be in Hanoi to discuss the United States servicemen who are still listed as missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps.  Few issues have stirred more frustration and - to families involved -despair, and few have had a more tenacious hold on politicians.  Legislators as ideologically apart as Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts have called for a ''full accounting'' from Vietnam of the fate of the so-called ''M.I.A.'s.'' On Tuesday, the Senate and House endorsed overwhelmingly, and without objection, proposals that supported General Vessey's visit to Vietnam.  ''The issue has taken on a sort of mythic character,'' said one key Senate aide.  Underneath the resolutions and ringing words, though, are only unanswered questions.  ''There's much fuzziness about what the words 'full accounting' really mean,'' the aide acknowledged. He and others said privately that no member of Congress would ever deny the possibility that, more than 12 years after the war, Americans are being held in Vietnam. But few actually believe it, the aide said.  ''What happened on this issue were two things,'' the Senate aide explained. ''When Reagan was elected he took a strong profile in '81 that the P.O.W.-M.I.A. issue was not resolved - a view that he expressed even as Governor of California. And you had the spate of Rambo movies which perpetuated the idea that there are living Americans held against their will there. Of course, the Vietnamese didn't help with their attitude involving the return of American remains.''  The Vietnamese have denied knowing of any remaining American prisoners, and they have denounced as fabrications refugee reports of caches of American remains that have not been returned to families.  ''We do have solid reason to believe that the Vietnamese have been less than forthcoming in the return of the remains of those serivcemen who died,'' said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House panel on Asian and Pacific Affairs. ''Why? I suppose they may feel there's a certain amount of mileage in doling them out. It's a ghoulish business, very cynical, but we have good reason to believe they could be more forthcoming.''  Diplomats believe the M.I.A. issue is sometimes involved in internal Vietnamese politics.  Thanh Bham, an attache at the Vietnamese Mission to the United Nations, said his country had tried many things in the last 14 years to resolve the problem, including returning all military and civilian personnel taken prisoner in the war, repatriating others who had remained in Vietnam and ''devoting great efforts for seeking information'' about Americans still missing.  ''I think that all these facts demonstrates the efforts and the sympathy of Vietnam towards the American people and American concerns on this issue,'' he said, ''although Vietnam has hundreds of thousands of its own soldiers missing in action.''  According to Ms. Shine's group, Vietnam has returned the remains of 170 identified servicemen since 1974. Most of them, 94, have been returned during the Reagan Presidency.  Like other legislators, Mr. Solarz is doubtful about the possibility of Americans still held captive in Southeast Asia, but he refuses to rule it out. He said ''a substantial number of live sightings'' by refugees, some of whom passed polygraph tests, had led him to conclude that it was ''not inconceivable'' that American prisoners remain in Vietnam.  Senator McCain was more categorical. ''We have to assume that there are Americans still alive in Southeast Asia,'' he said. ''I have no hard evidence of that and I base it on two factors. The first is the reports of unresolved live sightings. The second are what some highly experienced and highly respected peeople have said about this.''  He cited the comment last October by Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr., a former director of Defense Intelligence, who concluded after a five-month review of intelligence files that there was ''a large volume of evidence,'' mainly ''live sightings'' by Vietnamese refugees, that pointed to the likelihood that Americans are still imprisoned in Vietnam.  It is widely believed in Washington that some Americans willingly stayed behind in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.  Complicating the issue, both politically and emotionally, is the position of the Vietnam veterans.  ''A lot of Vietnam veterans are fed up and don't want to hear about it,'' said Mike Leaveck, communications director of the Vietnam Veterans of America, which says it represents 30,000 former servicemen and women. ''There's a lot of craziness on this issue.''  He pointed out that after World War II, a total of 78,000 American servicemen were unaccounted for. After the Korean War, the figure was 8,000. The figure for Southeast Asia is now 2,413. ''The tragedy is that certain fringe groups have discredited this issue and have exploited the pain of many families,'' he said.  Senator McCain agrees: ''This entire issue has been exploited very badly by some people, including those trying to get funds for so-called Rambo efforts, people trying to inflame passions unnecessarily, charlatans, in some cases, who see this as a profit-making opportunity.''  On the other hand, Ms. Shine's group, known familiarly as the National League of M.I.A. and P.O.W. Families, maintains strong relations with Congress, the White House and the Vietnam veterans. Its executive director, Ann Mills Griffiths, whose brother is missing in Vietnam, routinely attends White House and State Department meetings on the issue and went along on General Vessey's mission to Hanoi this weekend.  Praise for Reagan  Ms. Shine said the organization has a membership of 3,500 families. She said that previous Administrations had responded with ''apathy and non-effort'' to the issue but that Mr. Reagan had brought it to the forefront. ''As Governor of California he wore a P.O.W.-M I.A. bracelet,'' she said. ''He has made this the highest national priority.''  Ms. Shine remarked that 20 years after the Vietnamese war against the French, non-French legionnaires who had been held prisoner were returned. What advantage would the Vietnamese have in keeping American prisoners, she asked.  ''I don't have the answers,'' she said. And then, after a moment, the young woman who last saw her father when she was 8, added: ''You have to believe in blind faith.''

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 1-   A long-sought meeting between President Reagan's special envoy on Americans missing in action in Vietnam and newly installed Vietnamese leaders began here today, but with scant hopes of real progress on either side.  ''I have no illusions,'' the Foreign Minister Deputy Prime Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, told reporters this afternoon at the French-built palace that is the Government guest house. He was waiting to greet the envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey, Jr. General Vessey, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was an officer in the Vietnam War.  Mr. Thach said there was no chance the United States would be permitted to open a technical office in Hanoi to speed up the process of searching for missing Americans unless Hanoi gets an office in Washington. The two countries have no diplomatic relations, or interest sections in each other's capitals.  'Two-Way Traffic'  Mr. Thach said an American request for such an office would mean that he would ''have to reciprocate.''  If such a request were made, he said: ''I will raise my desire to have an office in Washington. So you see it is a two-way traffic.''  General Vessey declined to answer when asked if he was authorized to make such a request.  At the same time, Vietnamese officials said today that they were intending to broaden the talks to include ''humanitarian issues'' of their own.  The opening session lasted barely an hour today, and recessed until Sunday morning, when the meeting may end, or be adjourned to Monday, if there is enough reason for further talks.  Diplomats here from both Western and Soviet-bloc nations are virtually unanimous in saying that Vietnam attaches a very high priority to gaining American recognition. They say they are watching the talks for signs of whether or not communication between Washington and Hanoi can be improved under the government of a new Vietnamese communist party general secretary, nguyen van linh.  Hanoi has sent conflicting signals to Washington in the last few years. Discussions on resolving the cases of more 2,400 Americans missing in action in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam, began to make substantial progress in 1985 under the American leadership of Richard Childress, the National Security Council's director for Asian affairs. In January 1986, when joint excavation of crash sites had almost become routine, Vietnam said it had ''Started the clock'' on a two-year deadline to resolve the issue once and for all.  But within a few months, while in the throes of preparing for leadership changes and scrambling to institute economic reforms, Vietnam suddenly turned negative toward the United States. By the fall of 1986, when remains were last returned to the United States, all but superficial communication had stopped.  Hanoi's Conclusion  Southeast Asian diplomats familiar with developments in Vietnam say that Hanoi had concluded it was getting nothing in return for its cooperation, despite its protests that this was a strictly humanitarian gesture.  President Reagan, under pressure from a lobby calling for action on the issue of the missing, appointed General Vessey his special envoy in January. It took until the end of may for Vietnam to agree to this visit.  General Vessey came to Hanoi today with Mr. Childress, Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, David Lambertson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Asia and the Pacific, Robert Kingston, former director of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center in Hawaii, and Stephen Croker, an aide to General Vessey.  Diplomats here say the visit can be used by the Vietnamese as a demonstration of American interest, whether or not anything is achieved in the talks.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 2   United States and Vietnamese negotiators looking for ways to resolve the issue of 1,776 Americans still listed as missing in this country met briefly twice today.  Vietnamese officials were more optimistic after the talks this morning than they were on Saturday at the outset.  At a break between the sessions today, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told reporters the two sides had reached ''a better understanding'' on the issues.  Diplomats here say the talks will indicate how a new Vietnamese leadership under Nguyen Van Linh, the Communist Party general secretary, will be able to deal with Washington.  Mr. Thach, now also a Deputy Prime Minister, is thought to be one of the more influential members of the new administration.  The American delegation, led by John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to comment on any aspect of the talks, except to say there was more work to do.  This morning, when asked if a planned news conference would still be held on Monday, General Vessey, who is President Reagan's special envoy, brushed aside the question.  ''I don't know if you can expect one,'' he said brusquely. He also canceled plans for sightseeing in Hanoi today.  A previously unscheduled meeting of technical advisers was called for this afternoon. Technical meetings have in the past usually planned crash-site excavations or the returns of war dead.  There has been no decision about whether the higher-level talks will continue on Monday, when the American team is due to leave Hanoi.  ''The talk will resume when we are ready to resume,'' General Vessey said.  Remains of American war dead were last returned to the United States last fall. A resolution of the issue was interrupted, in part, by preparations for the change in Vietnam's leadership.  Many American officials, including most, if not all, on the team now in Hanoi, believe that Vietnam is holding several of the American war dead to be doled out as talks move toward what the Vietnamese hope will be eventual diplomatic recognition.  Few United States officials - and no Hanoi-based European diplomats -believe that any Americans are being held captive in Vietnam. But the Reagan Administration is under pressure from those who claim to have knowledge of such captives and say the Government is doing nothing to free them.

"   , Vietnam, Aug. 3   An American special envoy left Hanoi today with no progress reported in three days of talks on Americans missing since the Vietnam War.  Without some forward movement on the issue, the Reagan Administration has said, there can be no hope of improving relations between the two nations. Washington continues to refuse diplomatic recognition to Hanoi 14 years after United States forces withdrew from Vietnam and 12 years after the fall of the south.  A five-paragraph statement issued at the end of the talks indicates that cooperation between Hanoi and Washington on accounting for the missing has not recovered even the momentum it had achieved two years ago, when the two sides had begun to meet regularly. Talks were interrupted last year while Vietnam went through a leadership change.  Today's closing statement, read by a Vietnamese interpreter, said only that two technical-level meetings would be held ''in the near future'' - one to discuss how to step up accounting for missing Americans and the other to address ''certain urgent humanitarian concerns of Vietnam.''  The leader of the American delegation, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, refused to answer questions from reporters.  Vietnamese officials also declined comment, leaving the impression that this was the wish of the American side. Repeated recesses called by the Americans this morning for private consultations indicated that there was trouble with even the wording of the final statement.  No Linkage of Issues  In what may have been a concession to the Americans, the joint statement said both sides agreed that humanitarian issues ''should not be linked to broader political questions such as normalization or to economic aid.'' There had been speculation among foreign embassies here that Hanoi was considering reviving demands for war reparations.  Two years ago, the United States won agreement from the Vietnamese to hold at least six meetings each year on the missing-in-action issue. In January 1986, Hanoi followed that with a promise to begin a two-year program to resolve the issue once and for all. The deadline is now five months away, and officials on both sides refuse to comment on what will happen when it passes.  More than 2,400 Americans are still missing in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam or off its shores. While most if not all are presumed to have died, there has been no final accounting of their cases.  More than a million Vietnamese are still thought to be unaccounted for. Among other problems left behind by the war are war widows, orphans, the children of Vietnamese mothers and American fathers and people said to be suffering from chemicals for defoliation of forests and and other purposes. There are also a large number of handicapped people, both civilian and military.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",August 4 1987 ,2
"   , Vietnam, Aug. 5   Vietnamese officials expect to open talks with the United States before the end of this month that will for the first time address Vietnamese problems arising from the war, a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official said today.  ''For the last 12 years, we have handled humanitarian issues for the United States,'' the official, Nguyen Dy Nien, a Deputy Foreign Minister, said in an interview in his office here referring to the accounting of the 1,776 Americans missing since the war.  ''I think now the United States must - has already made a start to - deal with the humanitarian issues of Vietnam,'' said Mr. Nien, an expert on United States affairs. ''We can not carry on one-sidedly.''  Officials close to talks last weekend between the Vietnamese and an American team led by President Reagan's special envoy, Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., say that the American side balked at agreeing to a future meeting on strictly Vietnamese concerns.  Action 'Is Important'  ''In negotiations sometimes there is only one word in the text and it can take hours to remove it and replace it with another word,'' Mr. Nien said when asked about the American attitude toward talks on Vietnam's human casualties. ''But I told the American side that the important thing is action.''  ''We would like to close this chapter as soon as possible,'' he added. He recalled that in January 1986, Vietnam set a two-year timetable to resolve the issue. He declined to comment on what might happen when that period ends.  The Foreign Ministry official said that Vietnam, one of the world's poorest countries, had limited expectations about what assistance it could get from the United States. The Reagan Administration has ruled out reparations or war damages.  ''The humanitarian issues of Vietnam are enormous,'' Mr. Nien said. ''But we know the limits. We are realistic.''  Children of Servicemen  Mr. Nien said that in the recently concluded talks with the American delegation, the subject of the offspring of Americans based in Vietnam also came up. The Foreign Ministry official said it was his understanding that there might be a separate set of talks on this issue in the near future. Neither side knows how many of these children remain in Vietnam.  But a number of the children are reaching the age of majority, and Anerican humanitarian organizations say that this could make them eligible for military service, particularly since many are street urchins who might be viewed as delinquents.  Mr. Nien said Vietnam's political prison camp population, most suffering for their association with the United States-backed Saigon regime, had not been discussed with the Vessey party. He called this a political issue that was related to internal policies of Vietnam, Three years ago, Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, had challenged the United States to empty the camps. Secretary of State George P. Shultz responded by offering to resettle the political prisoners in the United States.  Visit by Solarz  But when Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, visited Hanoi in December 1984 and asked if Mr. Shultz's offer would be accepted, he was told that the prisoners could not be released unless the United States could guarantee they would not take part in ''anti-Vietnamese'' activities abroad.  Mr. Solarz told Vietnamese officials that rights of free speech in the United States made such a promise impossible.  Mr. Nien said today that he expected that General Vessey would ''keep up contacts'' with Vietnam, although he is not expected to be part of the next round of talks, which will be at the ''technical expert'' level. The Deputy Foreign Minister said General Vessey, a veteran of the Vietnam War, had been cordial but frank in the recent discussions.  Asked if there was a chance that a further round of talks may be held in Washington, Mr. Nien laughed.  ''We are not so optimistic,'' he said.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH  GRAPHIC: Photo of Gen. John W.

"    The United States has refused to open diplomatic relations with Vietnam, but officials of the two countries have been talking for years about 1,700 Americans still listed as missing since the United States troops quit the war in 1973. Despite persistent reports that some of the Americans may be alive, no conclusive evidence has been found. Last week, a high-level American delegation went to Hanoi and agreed to add ''certain humanitarian concerns of Vietnam'' to the agenda.  But, in a terse statement, the Americans and Vietnamese said humanitarian issues ''should not be linked to broader political questions such as normalization [of relations] or economic aid.'' ''Technical experts'' will meet soon to discuss ways to speed up accounting for the missing Americans.  John W. Vessey, a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, headed a nine-member delegation of American officials and families of the missing. He declined to elaborate on the official statement. But Nguyen Dy Nien, a Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister, said talks would begin this month. He added that there might be a separate discussion of the Vietnamese offspring of Americans. Neither side knows how many remain in Vietnam, but some are old enough to be eligible for Vietnamese military service, which could compromise their claims to American citizenship.

"      A Presidential envoy who visited Hanoi last week said today that Vietnam insisted it did not have control over any living Americans missing in action from the war.  Nevertheless, the envoy said, Hanoi suggested the possibility that there might be some in Southeast Asia, and the United States and Vietnam agreed that Hanoi would step up its effort to find missing Americans or their remains.  The envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he would not speculate on whether there are Americans being held involuntarily in Vietnam.  ''There are certainly all sorts of evidence to show that some might be there, but yet it has been a long time since the end of the war,'' General Vessey said.  He said that while the Vietnamese insisted that ''there are no live American prisoners under the control of the Vietnamese Government,'' they ''acknowledged that there are some wild parts of their country.''  ''The suggestion is that it is possible for there to be live Americans in Southeast Asia, not under the control of the Vietnamese Government,'' he said. ''That is the inference that I draw. They did not say that.'' Three Days of Talks He talked with reporters at the White House after briefing President Reagan on his three days of talks in Hanoi with Vietnamese officials on the issue of Americans missing in Vietnam. He was appointed President Reagan's special envoy on the matter last January.  He said the United States and Vietnam agreed that Hanoi would speed its efforts to find missing Americans or their remains, and that Washington would send experts to Hanoi to look into ''humanitarian concerns that the Vietnamese have,'' such as war orphans and people incapacitated by the fighting.  ''We agreed that we would address these as humanitarian concerns and not link them to broader political issues, such as normalization of diplomatic relations, resumption of trade or economic aid,'' he said.  More meetings will be held in Hanoi at the end of the month on the issue of the missing and the humanitarian issues, he said.  There are 2,413 Americans missing in action in Indochina, 1,776 of them in Vietnam.  General Vessey said Vietnam had agreed to pursue 220 cases involving missing Americans, including 70 cases on which the United States has compelling evidence that an American was alive after being reported missing.  ''We have people who were seen parachuting close to their forces, most probably captured,'' he said. ''Those men did not return, nor have their remains been returned.'' In another case, a picture of a wounded American was published during the war in a Vietnamese newspaper, yet he did not return and his remains have not been recovered.

"      Administration officials say the United States will officially encourage charitable assistance for Vietnam in exchange for increased cooperation from Hanoi in resolving cases of Americans missing in action during the Vietnam War.  Although the agreement, worked out with the Vietnamese last month, falls short of Hanoi's request for economic aid or war reparations, it is the first time that Washington has agreed to provide Vietnam with anything in return for help on this sensitive issue. It also marks an expansion of United States relations with Vietnam.  Without publicity, two doctors specializing in artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices and the head of an international charitable organization held talks last week in Hanoi where they had gone as an official United States delegation.  Report on Humanitarian Needs  Based on its findings, the Administration intends to issue a report detailing the humanitarian needs of the Vietnamese. It will focus on the thousands who require prosthetic devices as a result of the war as well as those since crippled by disease.  As a result, the Administration expects the Vietnamese to cooperate more fully on solving the issue of military personnel still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War. Officials said they are especially hopeful that Vietnam would be able to provide information to help clear up about 70 ''very compelling'' cases.  ''This means we crossed a line we never crossed before,'' said a senior official familiar with the dealings with the Vietnamese.  Resulted From Vessey Visit  United States officials had steadfastly refused to discuss economic assistance or war reparations as part of the talks about the missing servicemen. As a compromise, Washington will facilitate aid from private groups, which are now prohibited by a long-standing trade embargo.  The agreement was the result of a visit last month with senior Vietnamese officials by John W. Vessey Jr., a retired general, who led a special delegation to Hanoi to discuss the missing. The Administration will issue regulations providing exemptions to trade restrictions that will allow licensing of private organizations to provide charitable relief.  ''When the United States Government gives its blessing to this, we're saying that they're no longer a pariah,'' said the official.  'An Area of Accommodation'  Administration officials also depicted the agreement as an important step in successful negotiations with Vietnam. ''This provides an area of accommodation, of reconciliation,'' said one official. ''If they're smart, they won't try to leverage it into any kind of official recognition. If they try to use it as an opportunity and not a weapon, it can be promising.''  The United States has been seeking Vietnamese help in determining the fate of more than 2,400 servicemen who were listed as missing in action or failed to return from prisoner-of-war camps. American officials earlier expressed exasperation in negotiating with Hanoi, accusing the Vietnamese of stalling, in hopes that the discussions would include the normalization of relations and economic aid.  Shultz Aired Pessimism  Before Mr. Vessey left for Vietnam, Secretary of State George P. Shultz expressed pessimism that a breakthrough could be achieved. ''Humanitarian reciprocity is one thing,'' he told a veterans' group in July. ''But any attempt to trade information on our missing men for economic aid is another and we cannot agree to this.''  The category of artificial limbs was chosen as ''a particularly suitable first step,'' according to someone familiar with the negotiations. Artificial limbs and prosthetic devices are ''something tangible, something the Vietnamese can look at.'' He added, ''It's also especially appropriate after a war characterized by landmines and grenades in which many people were disfigured.''  According to some estimates, there are 60,000 amputees in Vietnam as a result of the war. There are also thousands of young people paralyzed from polio, according to one official.  The Administration hopes to have Vietnamese cooperation on what are known as ''discrepancy cases.'' Officials described those cases as those in which a serviceman did not return home after having been sighted alive after being taken prisoner, such as by fellow prisoners-of-war in a camp or in photographs of prisoners.  Dropped Its Insistence  American officials also say that Vietnam has dropped its insistence that they would no longer discuss the issue beyond next January. In January 1986, the Vietnamese said they would begin a two-year program to deal with the issue of American servicemen missing in action once and for all.  Hanoi says that more than one million Vietnamese are unaccounted for from the the war and that among the problems remaining are war widows, orphans, defoliated forests, destroyed villages and children of American servicemen.  The team that returned this week included Frederick Downs, the chief of the prosthetics service of the Veterans Administration; Dr. Carlton G. Savory, a Georgia orthopedist, and Larry E. Ward, who has had long experience in international relief organizations.  According to the National League of Families of American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s, Vietnam has returned the remains of 170 identified servicemen since 1974, of which 94 have been returned during the Reagan presidency.  Many American officials are deeply resentful at what they believe is Vietnam's intention to dole out the remains of other servicemen as talks progress.  A more intriguing, but murkier issue, is whether any American servicemen remain alive in Vietnam. Vietnam has asserted that it has no other prisoners and has no knowledge of any remaining live Americans in the country. Few United States officials officials believe that any Americans are still being held prisoner. But it is possible, officials say, that some Americans voluntarily remained behind.

"      A spokesman said today that the State Department was not linking progress on the issue of missing servicemen in Vietnam to private charitable aid to that country.  Charles E. Redman, the Department spokesman, said a decision to encourage private organizations to provide aid, especially prosthetic devices for amputees, was not connected to American efforts to obtain information about American servicemen missing since the Vietnam war.  ''We believe that P.O.W.'s-M.I.A.'s is a separate issue which stands on its own merits,'' Mr. Redman said, using the initials for American prisoners of war and those missing in action.  The Administration, according to high-level officials, plans to facilitate private charitable aid to Vietnam. The officials also said they hoped Vietnam would be more cooperative in solving the issue of missing personnel, especially about a group of ''very compelling cases'' said to number about 70.  Accords Reached Last Month  The agreements on both issues were worked out last month with senior Vietnamese officials by Gen. John W. Vessey Jr. a retired general who led a special delegation to Hanoi. After his visit, two official teams traveled to Vietnam, one a medical team to study the humanitarian needs of the country and the other to work on the 70 major cases.  Under the plan for facilitating non-governmental aid, the Administration intends to issue a report detailing the needs and encouraging private groups to provide it. The Administration will also provide exemptions from trade restrictions to license such groups to provide the aid.  LANGUAGE: ENGLISH                      ",September 9 1987 ,2
"   , Thailand, Sept. 16   A former United States Congressman arrived in Bangkok today with six relatives of American servicemen unaccounted for in Laos or Vietnam since the 1960's. The group plans to release 2,500 balloons Thursday with messages offering large rewards to those who can produce a missing American.  The delegation, headed by former Representative William Hendon, a North Carolina Republican, has raised $2.4 million to offer to citizens of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to bring out any American serviceman still alive and in captivity.  ''Nothing else has worked,'' Mr. Hendon said, alluding to more than a decade of negotiations with the governments of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  In Indochina, the United States has diplomatic relations only with Laos, where 549 Americans are still listed as missing. Another 1,776 are unaccounted for in Vietnam.  The group plans to go to northeast Thailand Thursday to inflate the balloons and send them into Laos.   WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 (AP) - The State Department said today that a private group's plan to float balloons in Indochina to advertise $2.4 million in rewards for the rescue of American servicemen could hurt official efforts to account for the missing. The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, the largest group representing the relatives of the missing, also criticized the effort.
